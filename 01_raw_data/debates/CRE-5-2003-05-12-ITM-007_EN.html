I just want to try and do something I have done in the past, which is to explain what this is in very simple terms and for the benefit of those not involved in these matters. What we are talking about is the production, by the traditional means of steam, of electricity, which is then supplied for efficient use in industry or for heating. The promotion of this technology can be seen as being consonant with the objectives – the Kyoto commitments – that we, and many other countries, have set ourselves. It will help to save energy, to use it efficiently, and to reduce emissions of CO2. Implementing this technology can also make supplies more secure.</p>
<p class="contents">My primary concern, when engaging in these discussions, when voting, and when tabling amendments, has been to shape a directive that will be applicable throughout Europe, at the same level, and with the same ground rules. This consideration applies in particular to the reference values to be used to define energy savings. We call upon the Commission to draw up, within an appropriate timeframe, a package of European reference values to facilitate comparisons of implementation in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I saw it as important that there should be greater legal certainty within the European Union, and that the Member States should, on the basis of this directive – assuming that it enters into force after second reading and, perhaps, after a conciliation procedure – have legal certainty and be able to promote this technology. The report is a highly technical one, and discussing it was a relatively complicated business. Our discussions were lively, but also very fair, and we were very fair-minded in our dealings with each other. There was no confrontation between Left and Right of the sort I have previously described, but rather a confrontation between North and South, each being convinced that one method or another was better. I believe that the compromise we have reached is a sound one.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us – myself included – have had to moderate our demands to some extent. I was not happy with all the compromises, but I accepted them as being what this is all about. At the end of the day, this result, at least in the committee, where there were 32 votes in favour, none against, and 11 abstentions – let me mention at this point that I am to this day unsure how the 11 abstentions came about – has shown that we have come to a sensible compromise. Including those in my report, we started out with 240 amendments. Tomorrow, there will be 11 amendments on the table for us to vote on. I think that is a very fine achievement. We have done good work, and I can tell you that one or other of the eleven amendments will not get my vote, but, on the whole, what comes out of first reading stage will look very good.</p>
<p class="contents">I just hope that the Council will match this by putting a proper political position on the table in May, or by June at the latest. What the Council is currently discussing differs to quite a large extent from what we have been discussing here, so the second reading is guaranteed to be, once more, exciting and highly contentious. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will go well and that we will adopt the report; then I will already be looking forward to the discussions in the course of second reading. If we all work together properly on that, and if the Council is well disposed, we will manage to get this report adopted by the end of this Parliamentary term – I think, at second reading stage or perhaps after a conciliation procedure – and then legal certainty will have been created.</p>
<p class="contents">To that extent, I think, we have been able to improve the Commission proposal by making it more precise, specific and exact, and I hope it will meet with general approval tomorrow.</p>

Furthermore, the debates in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have demonstrated how diverse the positions are, as have the meetings, hearings and seminars held in recent months in this Parliament, demonstrating the interest which this initiative has awoken in the different sectors of society. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur because he has been able to bring together and agree a solution with the various Members involved which in the end means that we are only talking about eleven amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a European framework for cogeneration is a great challenge. I am happy to say that, in my opinion, the proposal for a Directive on the promotion of cogeneration, which we are discussing, conforms to the requirements and furthermore it provides a response at a time when we are talking about integration of the European energy market and in particular the electricity market.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has pointed out, cogeneration can be an efficient way to produce heat and electricity jointly in a single process, its correct and appropriate use increases the security of supply, it leads to undeniable energy savings and a resulting reduction in greenhouse gases. But we know that we are facing problems relating to the energy market, since its advantages are not reflected in an equal fashion within the sector. No legal instrument resolves this problem and the directive creates the framework necessary to guarantee a stable environment for the initiatives to promote cogeneration. Within that framework, it falls to the States to make a greater effort to promote this process and to increase production, by means of specific measures, in the form of economic support programmes. They can also facilitate new investment, guarantee more equitable conditions and eliminate administrative and other types of obstacles, but all within an integrated European market.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with our proposal, the Member States, by means of an analysis of high-efficiency cogeneration potential, are obliged to estimate the expected heat demand in their territory, which is likely to be used appropriately, by means of cogeneration techniques. This is the first step, which must facilitate future initiatives and monitoring in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as a result of the future directive, energy and cogeneration producers will be in a position to request a guarantee of origin which demonstrates that the electricity sold to the network is genuinely produced by means of high-efficiency cogeneration, from cogeneration which results in global energy savings. This element is an instrument to increase the level of knowledge and transparency of the market and furthermore the proposal insists that there must be no discrimination against producers of energy by means of cogeneration with regard to the conditions for connection to the network, nor with regard to the purchase and sale of electricity. Furthermore, the States will have the right to prioritise electricity produced by means of cogeneration. The sector – as the honourable Members know – has expressed on repeated occasions the need for these measures if this type of production is really to be properly developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The definitions of cogeneration, and in particular high-efficiency cogeneration, may appear very technical, but to adopt a common methodology is an important step forward, which offers the sector undeniable legal certainty with regard to efficiency requirements. It offers the States an instrument for creating support programmes capable of promoting cogeneration and at the same time to prevent distortions in the internal energy market, and also distortions in the field of competition, in a more extensive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have explained the Commission's objective in relation to this proposal, and I await the debate which is now going to take place. I trust that, together with the rapporteur, we will be able during this legislature to approve this text at second reading, since I believe it is extremely important in order to complete all the actions we are implementing in the aim of increasing energy efficiency and energy savings and promoting renewable energy sources, as we have been doing over recent years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have tried to stress that cogeneration is not an end in itself but an energy efficiency measure and that this proposal, which pursues the Commission's strategy of increasing energy efficiency in the European Union, was well received but at the same time presented a series of problems, as the rapporteur, Mr Glante, pointed out at the outset. Then, by means of close dialogue and debate between various members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we presented a balanced proposal which was genuinely significant from the point of view of energy savings.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, cogeneration based on heat demand will therefore allow us to optimise the situation in terms of greenhouse gases and balance the functioning of the electrical system. However, this whole building could have fallen down upon us if we had promoted an unnecessary demand for heat. Too simplistic an approach – such as the one I believe was proposed initially – would have led us to promote the construction of cogeneration plants without there being any real heat demand. And this would have been contrary to what we believed the objective of this proposal to be.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Glante and everybody who has participated in the various meetings which have taken place on this issue, because it was not an easy issue to understand. They include my colleague, Mr Vidal-Quadras, who has worked courageously on this directive. We have been through numbers, formulae, variables and subscripts and I believe we have finally managed to bring our points of view closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise amendments represent good progress in terms of reaching a final agreement and it is significant that the existence of different technologies throughout the length and breadth of the European Union has been recognised. It is the case that the more heat a plant produces, the greater the global efficiency of the cogeneration process. But to reduce the whole directive to this statement is simplistic and unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">A plant for the exclusive production of heat with an efficiency of 80% is entirely inefficient – I would even go as far as to say obsolete – but a plant for the production of electricity with an efficiency of 50% may be very efficient. And why is all of this the case? For the simple reason that electricity is a more elaborate form of energy which is obtained from heat.</p>
<p class="contents">Once it is made clear that the global efficiency of the plant is not an appropriate or absolute parameter for determining the value of cogeneration, what are we left with? We are left – as I believe Mr Vidal-Quadras will also point out – with primary energy savings and consequently gas emissions savings. This is the most appropriate parameter for measuring the benefits derived from cogeneration, when compared to the separate production of heat and electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget an important point: that cogeneration has been developed in the different Member States according to cultural traditions. In the countries of the Centre and the North of Europe heat for municipal uses predominates, and it is obvious that heating and hot water needs are enormous during much of the year; in other latitudes a form of cogeneration in which the proportion of heat is lower has developed for obvious reasons, and therefore electricity for industrial uses predominates. The remainder is sold on the network.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Glante has been able to see that this proposal required a profound analysis before reaching definitive conclusions. However, as draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I must say that this was not the case in this committee and that the opinion it approved, in the light of what is being proposed today, following the debates and meetings which have taken place, lacks realism and rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">The complexity of this issue was demonstrated a moment ago and I, as rapporteur supported by my group, requested a more flexible timetable. In other words, I asked that this proposal be debated seriously and that there might be more time to compare our differing opinions with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. This request was denied and the proposal was voted on in a hurried fashion with the result that I am now describing. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, amongst all of us, we must try to prevent situations such as this. An opinion cannot be drawn up in the way it has been drawn up in the case of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on cogeneration, which I fear is not an isolated case since it happens relatively often in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe we have produced a rigorous, proportionate and necessary proposal. I would therefore congratulate the rapporteur once again, and my colleagues in the Industry Committee, on their excellent work, and particularly on not accepting the first proposal and fighting to reach agreements on a proposal which satisfies everybody. Congratulations, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Glante, for his excellent cooperation. It was clear to me from my first reading of the report that it would need more than one debate in this House, but I do believe that we in this House agree on what the directive is intended to do. Its objective is, quite simply, to give priority to the saving of energy and to its efficient use. I believe that our long debates have led us to a high degree of consensus on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">At the very outset, Mr Glante put forward some forty amendments, which formed the basis for excellent discussions. I have to say that he not only handled the technical aspects very well, but also – and this is most important – the human dimension, involving bringing people together and striving for compromises. We ended up with 240 amendments, which, of course, we all worked through together. We eventually succeeded in finding the compromise we sought. What is now before us is very much a consolidated version, one that I think we can all live with, and the fact that it has developed along the right lines is demonstrated by the way the Industry Committee voted. We have, of course, prepared minor amendments for this reading, but I think that the basic principle we hammered out together for sustainability in the area of energy supply will have very far-reaching effects.</p>
<p class="contents">What was of primary importance for us was finding a harmonised system for the<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>calculation method. This itself was not the focus of attention, as there were so many different options and possible approaches to it; what was, though, more important to us was finding a basis for the whole of Europe, enabling the harmonised system to be universally applicable, whether in the North/South sphere or elsewhere. We know that there are countries in Europe where it gets very hot, and others that need a lot of heat, some needing cooling down and others needing warming up, so that there are very different interests at play here. At this point, I would like to thank those who are called lobbyists, who have done truly outstanding work, teaching us a great deal about the options available. The final result has been that we have learned a very great deal from the many debates, discussions and evening events, when we often stayed for a very long time discussing these things.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is of course a future increase in the share of cogenerated energy from 9% to 18%. It should be clear that what we are after is for the figure to be doubled. When it comes to working out the formulas, we would very much like the CEN Workshop to be involved, together with the Commission, and all parties involved to again get to grips with standardisation, so that, in the event of a second reading – which I expect we will have – there will be another variant to be debated. So we are, de facto, hiding behind the CEN Workshop as regards a final solution as to how we take this forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that, in principle, cogeneration can spark a completely new debate on the supply of electricity and energy, especially when we consider the micro-cogeneration plants. It is the very safety of the small circuit systems that makes them a very interesting concept for the future. We are all well aware from the renewable energy and the various central heating plants that we already have in the rural fabric and in small villages, that cogeneration has made its presence very much felt in these places, and that, moreover, the market of course functions in a completely different way. If, then, in future, we consider not only the large installations, which were our primary focus of attention here, but also the many small regional ones, perhaps even the domestic units that may one day be possible, we can accordingly achieve something on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In Wels, the city from which I come, they are planning a project called ‘EnergyLand’. In fact, Europe ought to be an ‘EnergyLand’. We are endeavouring to put research and development centre-stage in this ‘EnergyLand’ and, in the area of education and training, to make these new methods and new funding possibilities known to the wider public and, especially, to the business world. In future, of course, we should give closer attention to energy and to the infrastructure in the energy sector, for a secure energy supply and efficient energy should certainly be among the primary objectives of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore going to support the Commission’s initiative, which deserves all our respect, and we congratulate the Commissioner on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Production by means of cogeneration allows, firstly, energy savings and, as a consequence, achieves an environmental protection objective, since it reduces CO2 production.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other reasons why this method deserves our support. Firstly, by producing heat and electricity in a combined fashion, costs can be reduced, and also, if required, users can be offered an alternative supply, which, in some cases, is a way of introducing competition, particularly in those markets – as is the case in the electricity market in my country – where there is a strong oligopolistic component.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for the promotion of cogeneration has been ratified by this Parliament in its Resolution of 25 September and we will therefore be acting coherently by supporting this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">But the problem is that, when we talk about the concept of cogeneration, there are in fact very differing realities between cogeneration in the countries of the North of Europe and that in the South. It was therefore very difficult to combine such different realities in a single proposal. In the countries of the North cogeneration is essentially used to produce heating, while in the South, cogeneration is a system used by certain industrial sectors which require the production of intensive heat and also reduces the cost of electrical energy. Examples of this are the paper industry and the ceramics industry.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be deduced from this that the cogeneration plants used in different countries differ radically. While in the plants dedicated to heating steam turbines are used, and it is only necessary to generate heat during the cold months of the year, in those intended for cogeneration production for industrial purposes the heat required is of greater intensity and is used throughout the year.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that there are differing sizes and systems, and to encompass everything within a single directive has been difficult. I believe that the efforts made by the rapporteur to encompass and include such differing realities in the text of the directive have been remarkable to say the least, and I would therefore like to congratulate him warmly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, in general terms, we will support the text of the report with the amendments proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For non-specialists like myself it became at times an impenetrable mass of acronyms and technical details, and Mr Glante and Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca at times seemed to be speaking a language that sane, normal human beings could not possibly follow. I never knew, for instance, that something called the <span class="italic">Protermo</span> <span class="italic">method</span> could produce as much heat and fury as it did in the debate in our committee. It is a pity we did not combine that heat in our committee with some power while we were at it. Still, even for those such as myself who were not able to follow every twist and turn, my group is certainly extremely pleased with the outcome and looks forward to supporting the rapporteur in the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly pleased that the two approaches represented by the differing sides of the debate in our committee – on the one hand wishing to retain a methodology to distinguish cogeneration from other forms of generation, and on the other hand wishing to maintain an accent on energy saving – have been retained in the famous Annexes two and three, and that some accommodation between those two perspectives has been reached. We are also extremely pleased to support the measures in this directive which protect and promote micro-cogeneration, which we feel to be an essential component in the development of CHP and also of course – I speak on behalf of my group and that of others – we are very keen to try to use tomorrow's vote as a starting point to have a serious though no doubt tough debate with the Council on maintaining and pursuing real rather than just symbolic targets.</p>
<p class="contents">My final note is one of caution. There are a number of amendments tabled. I would urge colleagues from other groups to refrain from supporting amendments which disturb this very delicately constructed compromise. It would seem, at least to us in my group, to be a shame to jeopardise a compromise which took so long and was frankly so painful in its birth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the heat generated in the production of electricity can be used for both heating and cooling, it is an economic resource, the utilisation of which (one would think) served the interests of the production plants themselves. The directive is not needed just because it will help to protect the single energy market. It is also needed to compel the Member States to channel resources for the effective use of fuels in the name of efficiency and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Common objectives are set very carelessly in the EU. An objective is set, but neither the resources nor the sanctions to achieve these objectives are created. An example of setting objectives based on wishful thinking is the promotion of cogeneration now being discussed. The aim to increase cogeneration to account for 18% of electricity generation by 2010 or 2012 is a pious hope. The market will engage in cogeneration if it is financially worthwhile. The directive will not mean the market’s unseen hand will lose the power of its grip.</p>
<p class="contents">Small production units are often innovative: they make good use of margins that do not interest the big producers. For that reason, in many of the amendments one feels there is concern regarding the equal treatment of small producers in a liberalised market dominated by the large producers. It is only reasonable to insist that the small producers should be certain of having access to the network, and they should get a fair price for electricity from cogeneration.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would furthermore like to draw attention to the problems that arise if there is no coordination between different directives. For example, the directive on a system for greenhouse gas emission rights trading should not be inconsistent with this directive. The former is a synthetic market directive, whilst this directive on cogeneration is financial/technical. The directive on emission rights trading is not in the interests of European business, whilst this directive is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What this means is that it is concerned with better protection for the environment, with greater security of supply and also with coherence in the internal market in energy. I want, briefly, to highlight the point about security of supply. We are too dependent upon oil imports, and cogeneration makes it a very simple matter, in a very short space of time, to do without oil for domestic heating, and is much simpler than the electricity market as a way of becoming independent of oil.</p>
<p class="contents">The market, the internal market, is blind if we do not give it something to aim for, if we do not install guard rails. What we did for renewable energies, we must also do for cogeneration. It is in this respect that I regard the Commission proposal as somewhat feeble, and I am glad that tomorrow, there will, I think, be a majority in this House for reiterating the 18% objective and underlining the contribution cogeneration can make to our entering the hydrogen era. We cannot have President Prodi gathering together a high-level group of experts and then fail to incorporate into law the first regulatory framework that really enables us to create a market for fuel cells, with a growing European demand for them as its result. I am glad that Mr Rübig and other Members see this point so clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the definitions. Definitions might be thought to be technical in nature, but, in fact, politics lurks behind the technology. Annex II is about determining which current in a cogeneration plant is actually cogenerated electricity. This definition is independent of climate zones. There can be only one definition, and it must apply throughout Europe. If such is not the case, we are opening the way to distortions of competition in the European internal market. The amendments that Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca intends to bring in tomorrow do not help in this respect and should be voted out.</p>
<p class="contents">Annex III defines the energy efficiency of cogeneration plants. This is where there is a clear difference between, for example, Greece and the Netherlands, because many Greeks still heat their homes inefficiently with coal, whilst the Dutch have highly efficient gas heating. Such differences of climate can be compensated for only after an indefinite period of time and with a fully-functioning internal market, so we should allow ourselves some time for this. In any case, Annex III has to build on Annex II. The only electricity that this directive must consider is that which has undoubtedly been derived from cogeneration. If it fails to do so, the result will be legal uncertainty and an open door for subsidies, some of which are inefficient, while others amount to something like fraud. If we fail to lay down unambiguous definitions, we will be helping those who are in fact less well-disposed to cogeneration in Europe. I believe that what we all want this directive to do is to get cogeneration taken more seriously in future, and to get people investing in this technology, especially in Eastern Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The three central points we have achieved, Mr President, by means of this long discussion, have been, firstly, to place primary energy saving at the heart of the Directive as an essential defining parameter; secondly, to calculate the percentage energy saving in relation to the electricity produced and not in relation to the total of heat plus electricity, in order to emphasise where the energy saving is achieved; and finally we have distinguished clearly between two situations: that of those installations which work permanently producing heat and electricity simultaneously and that of those which, because of the way they operate and the purposes they serve, produce electricity and heat simultaneously only for part of the year, and the rest of the year work exclusively in condensation mode.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these three points were essential to achieving the aim of this Directive, which was a good definition of cogeneration, and which will allow us to define a good system for stimulating this form of energy production, leading to what we are all seeking: savings of primary energy, reduction of CO2 emissions and increasing the Union’s independence with regard to the external supply of energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this discussion, which we have all participated in with great enthusiasm, dedication and goodwill, has not been enough for the whole of the House – Mr Turmes for example – but neither can we expect everybody to understand everything straightaway. I am sure that Mr Turmes, who is very knowledgeable in this field, will continue considering it, and that what he cannot see today he will soon see clearly. I am happy to continue explaining the same things both to him and his collaborators, as I have done up till now – although having heard his speech I see that I have not been successful – because talking to him is always a pleasure, in political and human terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Glante, please allow me to address an observation expressly to you, and I would like to thank you warmly for your receptiveness and cooperation throughout the work we have done together: when a sculpture is finished and is almost perfect, there are always certain final touches which make it absolutely perfect. I would draw your attention to Amendments Nos 75 and 81, which correspond to the agreement we reached after the meeting in committee and which our group considers to be essential: Amendment No 75, which removes the threshold of 80%, which no longer makes sense, and Amendment No 81, which clearly distinguishes between each type of installation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, General de Gaulle said that policy is action at the service of a strong, simple and clear idea. If this is the case, Commissioner, you have a European energy policy in mind and, as long as you continue to develop it, this Parliament will support you, because it fulfils objectives which we all wish to achieve: increasing our competitiveness, guaranteeing the well-being of all Europeans and greater economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal for a directive on the promotion of cogeneration is an important part of the EU’s strategy for energy efficiency and energy savings. Cogeneration will also contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases, as has been said here.</p>
<p class="contents">The short-term aim must be to develop the present cogeneration plants and, where possible, to encourage the establishment of high-efficiency plants. The longer-term objective must be to create a framework for ensuring that high-efficiency cogeneration has a key role to play in increasing energy efficiency and savings.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments relating to micro-generation, renewable energy sources and district cooling are important in terms of technological development. It is possible to store heat in all size categories for a day or a year, as opposed to what is stated in the Commission proposal and in certain committee opinions. Financial support should not be restricted just to CHP technology based on a useful heat demand. Flexibility in the use of CHP plants must be permitted, as dictated by the time of year, the working day and random variables. Waste heat produced at a cogeneration plant has a potentially wider use than is the case at present. It may also be used, for example, for cooling, water purification and air conditioning.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is very technical, and the Finnish word ‘suuritehoinen’ (‘powerful’) often mistakenly appears in the Finnish language version. The correct translation is ‘korkean hyötysuhteen’ (‘high-efficiency’). The word ‘suuritehoinen’ would lead the reader to understand that the directive only applied to large installations. The important thing is that the will is there to support high-efficiency technology regardless of size. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report on cogeneration that we have here is enormously important in terms of a sustainable energy policy in Europe. I should first of all like to join my fellow Members in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Glante, for his extremely amiable, pleasant, very constructive cooperation. I should like to call upon him to continue this cooperation until the end, to ensure that we achieve a good result tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been rightly pointed out that the emphasis has come to be placed much more on the conservation of energy. The important thing, of course, is seeing to it that we arrive at a situation in which we in Europe are able to achieve our CO2 targets. Cogeneration plays a very important role in this. What is also particularly important, however, is of course that we aspire to have high-quality installations in Europe, that we do not become lazy about cogeneration, but instead set our sights as high as possible in order to achieve the maximum possible savings. I think that that is the message that should also be sent out by the Commission, Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I actually liked the picture painted by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca very much. It is almost complete, but something still remains to be done: we need to add further – but minor – refinements to Annexes II and III. The subdivision of fuel consumption not related to cogeneration is now, therefore, being moved to Annex III, so we have to tidy up Annex II a little, simplifying it slightly, more in the direction of Annex III. That, Mr Glante, is also the reason why we tabled both Amendment No 175 and Amendment No 176.</p>
<p class="contents">This has turned out to be a very technical report, but it ultimately revolves around the fact that we are in need of a common, precise calculation method and harmonisation of the support schemes applied by the European Union. Amendment No 42 is essential. It is essential that this harmonised reference value for determining primary energy savings by cogeneration<span class="bold"> </span>is brought in as soon as possible, namely within two years. It is also essential that the calculation method be precise and harmonised throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The report now contains that whole package, and for this reason I think that it deserves our support. I hope, therefore, that Mr Glante will also be able to secure the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for his proposal tomorrow. Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca has already indicated how essential Amendments Nos 75, 76 and 81 are to us. It all depends on him, therefore – on his support for our amendments – whether the PPE-DE Group is able to follow him. I hope that it can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our position, too, is characterised by the environmental aspects. The Committee on the Environment agreed on that unanimously, after the vote had, indeed, been deferred twice by reason of the somewhat laborious discussion. The significance of a safe, economical, and environmentally friendly supply of energy is not a matter of dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">The production of energy to a high standard could also be guaranteed by building power plants based on a system of cogeneration, which, when compared with separate generation, has the advantage that it makes the most efficient use of fuels, whether from fossil or renewable sources. Moreover, the process of cogeneration can avoid the emission of carbon dioxide, which means that stepping up the promotion of cogeneration plants is an essential instrument in the package of measures required to comply with the Kyoto protocol on global climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union at present, however, cogeneration is not yet being used to its full potential as a means of saving energy. A substantial extension of its use is indispensable when it comes to dealing with climate change and saving resources. Along with securing the energy supply, another fundamental objective of the draft directive submitted by the Commission is to create a framework capable of promoting the building and proper operation of cogeneration plants. We believe that the draft put forward by the Commission is right in principle, but in need of improvements at various points, a view taken also by the members of the leading Committee and expressed by their rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever happens, we want to see the ambitious objective laid down that the proportion of the total electricity generated in the European Union by cogeneration plants should be doubled, rising from 9%, as it was in 1994, to 18% in 2012. We need transparent rules on what can be promoted as a cogeneration plant, rules that must be applicable throughout the European Union. The two-stage procedure proposed by the Commission, with its classification of energy for agriculture, industry and heating, does not provide that transparency; instead, it simply demands an excessive burden of administration. It is for that reason that we want to impose as standard an index figure for electricity and 80% efficiency. That, at any rate, is what the Environment Committee has decided. In addition, cogeneration plants with an output of over 50 megawatts should also fall within the maximum aid envisaged by the EU. There is no doubt that the limit proposed by the Commission is set too low. Even small cogeneration plants can produce 100 megawatts, or even more. Small and medium-sized plants ensure decentralised implementation, which can certainly make for effectiveness in terms of protection of the environment. We must do more to counteract increasing global warming, and a cleverly conceived directive on cogeneration plants can certainly help to do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly wish to support the importance of aiming at energy savings over efficiency: we want to use less fuel. I welcome the linkage of support with the environmental benefits that will flow from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer to some concerns expressed by a company in my former constituency and now the south-west region that I represent. They tell me they have supplied co-generation plant over the past 20 years, which has contributed to an estimated annual saving of 700 000 tonnes of carbon, which is a significant saving. They are concerned about this 50-megawatt threshold for eligibility. They want it to be removed as a distortion or potential distortion to investment decisions. They are very keen on the test of eligibility for support to be based on primary energy savings and – a point which has not yet been mentioned – they want the directive to recognise and reward the benefits of utilising waste heat and fuels. That can come from a variety of sources.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to raise two concerns of my own. Firstly, we must beware of losing sight of the objectives of this directive beneath this welter of technical detail. Colleagues have referred to the complexities that we have been addressing in committee and sometimes it has been a little obscure what the outcome would be. We must remember that we are looking for primary energy savings.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the potential for over-elaborate administrative requirements: too many people being involved in the certification and eligibility procedures. There is always a risk that one can stifle an initiative by too much bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to broadly commend and support this proposal. We look forward to achieving a good result in the vote tomorrow with the cooperation that we have seen up to now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our task over all these recent years has been to propose greater energy efficiency, greater savings and use of energy, all for the sake of sustainable development, which means not just guaranteeing competitiveness and quality of service for users, but also respecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that all the honourable Members will agree that what we cannot do, under the banner of ‘cogeneration’, is to ultimately create a system in which more energy is consumed than would be consumed in a separated fashion throughout the process and which furthermore benefits from subsidies which, at the end of the day, are paid for by users, the taxpayer – there are various possibilities – or simply network clients, leading not just to inefficient use of energy and greater energy consumption, but also distortions of competition and a lack of competitiveness throughout the system, which I believe would benefit nobody.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is to support real cogeneration and to prevent subterfuge, which, on the pretext of carrying out cogeneration activity, really involves other types of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to thank the rapporteur. Several of you have referred to the complex and difficult discussions. I understand that many aspects are highly complex from a technical point of view and I would therefore like once again to thank you for the effort and quality you have put into your work, despite the fact that the Commission cannot accept some of the elements proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the 85 amendments remaining, the great majority are acceptable either totally, partially or following some modification. Nevertheless, there are 28 which we reject entirely. I will provide the honourable Members with a complete copy, Mr President, so that there are no doubts<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to comment on some of the points you have raised and to explain the Commission's position. For example, we cannot accept those amendments which change the terminology proposed by the Commission throughout the text since I believe they may lead to error. I am referring to the amendments which replace the term 'useful heat' with 'useable calorific energy' and the removal of the term 'high efficiency' in association with certain types of cogeneration when there is a specific quantifiable saving. Cogeneration must be based on a real and justified energy demand and we must insist on high efficiency as a guarantee of energy saving. I hope that the honourable Members understand the Commission's views in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the motivation behind certain amendments which intend to establish national and European Union objectives for developing cogeneration, but I cannot support their content, because to insist on cogeneration objectives will lead to a situation of total conflict within the Council. Amongst other things, because the objective of 18% for each Member State may be mistaken, since it was set in 1997 on the basis of 1994 data and not on the definitions which we are now dealing with. Furthermore, that objective was not indicative for each of the Member States, but rather it was a global objective for the 15 States as a whole. In this regard, in order to produce objectives by Member State, we would have to carry out an analysis, like the one we carried out in the case of ‘green energy’, in which we produced a country-by-country assessment of the potential of the renewable energy sources which could be used to produce electricity in the various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation has not been sufficiently assessed. Furthermore, there are currently extremely significant developments in consumption taking place in certain countries which prevent us from setting these individualised objectives in a genuinely realistic manner at the moment; we could do so as a way of expressing our will, but it would not be a realistic element. The honourable Members know that I, when I make a commitment and propose an objective, like it to be realistic, and therefore ambitious but achievable, and that it relate to the potentials and capacities of each State of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments deal with the obligations of the States in relation to guaranteeing connection to the electricity network without costs and guaranteeing minimal charges for electricity produced by means of cogeneration. We cannot accept these amendments, since we must guarantee that producers of energy by means of cogeneration have equal access to the electricity network, without any prejudicial discrimination against them, but we must guarantee the distribution and transmission of production provided that it is necessary and under conditions for electricity exchange which are equitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can we accept the amendment which relates to the obligation to present a proposal for a directive on the promotion of energy produced by means of cogeneration after some years. Although this is a complex issue, I believe we have had sufficient time to be able to develop these aspects within this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the rapporteur's desire is to establish an exact and detailed definition of the electricity produced by means of the generation contained in Annex II. Nevertheless, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 70 and 75, which introduce a detailed calculation method in the legislative text, since we are not convinced that the sector can unanimously accept this method and, even if it could, I did not believe it would be appropriate to include it in the directive, since that would make it an excessively rigid directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand and support the intentions expressed on the need for specific measures for micro-cogeneration, although certain amendments will not be acceptable – Amendments Nos 38 and 41 I believe – but I would also like to express my agreement with the European Parliament on the need to seek the greatest possible harmonisation of calculation principles and savings in primary energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to express my gratitude for the work done and to acknowledge the complexity of the issue, but I would insist that it is one of the elements which can allow us to significantly increase energy efficiency and therefore energy savings, which is one of our priority objectives in terms of energy policy and security of supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
