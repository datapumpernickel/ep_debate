<p class="contents">Allow me first to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work and support on this important and urgent proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The SARS emergency in the early spring of 2003 served as a sharp reminder of the need to accelerate the further development of our capacity to deal with health threats. The current epidemic of avian influenza in Asia – that we have just discussed – with its potential risk to public health, reinforces the need for prompt and effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing Community network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases is a solid basis on which we can build – to enhance cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and international organisations, in particular the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have the means at our disposal to respond to emerging health threats based on the best scientific advice, in the shortest possible time. Establishment of the centre marks the shift from ad hoc cooperation to structured coordination through a focal point, giving clear scientific leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">In some recent cases, in response to WHO requests for help, we have seen teams from different Member States investigating the same phenomena with slightly different methodologies, sending samples to different laboratories, with each of them reporting separately. This divergence would end with the creation of a scientifically reputable centre with the authority to act at Community level on matters such as surveillance, networking of expert laboratories or mobilising outbreak investigation teams.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s text takes into account budgetary rigour and respects the Member States’ responsibilities on public health.</p>
<p class="contents">At first, the centre's core task will be to deal with communicable diseases from whatever source – deliberate or adventitious. The question of extending its mandate subsequently should be addressed on the basis of experience. I very much hope that we can reach a speedy agreement between the institutions – during first reading – to enable the centre to become operational as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statement and the debate we have just been listening to show the hopes and the fears of our constituents and their concern that we do better in this area in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of avian flu, with the transmission from hens to ducks to pigs to humans – resulting in the deaths of 19 humans – mutation is a possibility. When we look back at the SARS experience and when we look around at the constant threat of bioterrorism, we see the need for this centre to coordinate better, as the Commissioner has said, and we see the need for urgency in bringing this measure forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with health emergencies that are within the competence of the European Union. We are also dealing with other health areas and starting, as the Commissioner has said, with communicable diseases, not least those with drug-resistant strains, which threaten our communities.</p>
<p class="contents">This report provides for a later review in three years' time, which will look at the scope of the measure and the experience gained and see how best we can move forward in terms of other health monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">The centre does not resemble the American Central Direction Center, but is rather a network of networks. It is neither bureaucratic, nor is it costly. In due course, we may need to look at its costs to see if we are adequately funding it, but for now it is certainly not costly. It will work closely with national networks and no national network need feel threatened by this because they will fully be a part of it. It will also work with international agencies, particularly the WHO, which is so fundamental in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In our discussions we have had two key issues before us. One was the scope, where we found a happy and acceptable solution, and the other was the board, where there was some controversy. I am one of those who has always argued for small boards for these authorities and agencies, as I did for the Food Safety Authority, but in this case there is a fundamental reason why we need to have every Member State represented on the board and that is because every Member State may be asked to contribute to the work of the centre. That is sensible. I am grateful also that we have been able to ensure that we have parliamentary representation on the board.</p>
<p class="contents">It is urgent that this set-up should be in place by 2005 and for that reason we have to do this in a single reading, given the complexities of the parliamentary year ahead. It has been a complex process of consultation with colleagues and with the Council that has led to a complex set of mainly technical and linguistic amendments. We now have two blocks of amendments; the first are those that I commend to this House, and the second those that are superseded by the first. There are then two further amendments tabled by the ELDR Group and I have to say to the House that, whatever one thinks of those amendments, were they to be accepted it would jeopardise the possibility of having this measure brought forward by 2005. I therefore have to ask the House to reject those two amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">This report has only been possible because of the collaboration with my colleagues in my Group and across the groups, and I am deeply grateful to them, to the shadow rapporteurs, to the Group, the committee and the parliamentary secretariats. Our discussions and debates have also played a role, including those with the Commission and the Council, which have often been forceful, yet always positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful both to the former Italian presidency and the current Irish presidency for the work we have been able to do together. This proposal will enhance our Community and national ability to look after public health throughout the European Union. It will enable us to work with other countries beyond the European Union to prevent, control and defeat the health threats that we face today. I commend this measure to the House.</p>

Obviously I am going to say how urgent we believe it is for this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to be set up. This is also apparent from the discussions we have just had this morning and those we had last year at a time when the health threats were severe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to put a system in place that will enable us to respond both effectively and swiftly because, as everyone knows, diseases know no borders. Not to mention that the risks of propagation are all the greater for exchanges between people and movements to the four corners of the globe being increasingly frequent. Finally, the potential threat of bioterrorism means we need to be particularly vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we must not worry the public, but rather prevent risk and put in place every possible means of detection and rapid response. Such an approach therefore requires very close coordination between the Member States and concerted action to pool resources, competences and knowledge. With this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control we are establishing a Europe of immune defence.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that this Centre will be able to provide objective and easy to understand information about health risks for the public at large and in particular that it will be operational as soon as possible. We must not delay but work to see that it is set up. In this regard, everyone must show a sense of responsibility, at all costs avoiding – and this is perhaps where I differ slightly from the rapporteur – potential conflicts arising from interests associated with national representation, for example. This centre is not in fact intended to replace the national authorities but to help them to network, obviously, with the competent Community agencies like the European Food Safety Authority, the European Drugs Agency and, of course, all the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the choice of headquarters, I hope it will be as operational as possible and that we will avoid fruitless arguments. None of this, though, will do any good unless we apply our European research efforts to all these health questions. As we are always saying in this Chamber – my fellow Member Mrs Roth-Behrendt said it just now – we would like the Member States to listen to us at last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transmission of epidemics is facilitated by movements of populations, environmental and social changes, globalisation and war. The Community, alongside its obligations which derive from the Treaties, must also respond to citizens' concerns. That is why the creation of a centre which will focus on prompt diagnosis and on evaluating and publicising existing and re-emerging risks to public health in a fast, flexible and efficient manner is long overdue.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will coordinate and reinforce the work of the European Commission, the Member States and the Network for Epidemiological Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases. It will operate in cooperation with all the existing services involved in public health, such as the World Health Organisation and the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, Mr President, and following recent developments – I refer to the previous debate which we had on bird flu – I should like to emphasise that we agree with the rapporteur's proposal to close the matter at first reading and for the centre to open in 2005, even if we are not entirely satisfied with the Council's positions. However, I should like to thank the rapporteur for accepting my proposals to extend the scope of the regulation to other serious health threats and not just communicable diseases. I should also like to thank him because he accepted the need for the repercussions of recent epidemics on both physical and mental health to be recorded and handled appropriately. For funding, Commissioner, it is vital that the Centre have its own line in the budget and appropriations which will allow it to respond to its difficult mission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously this was something that needed to be done at European level, first and foremost because no fewer than 19 new emergent and fatal viruses have appeared since 1976, viruses that know no frontiers and move as fast as an aeroplane: Aids, the Ebola virus, the West Nile virus, SARS, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">It is something that needs to be done at European level, too, because this is where Europe’s health must be defended whenever that can and must be done better here than at the other levels, be it local authorities, regions or states. And that is clearly the case now, when we are having to combat these viruses that are transmissible to man. The epidemic of atypical pneumonia has confirmed the courage of those researchers and doctors who have risked their lives to alert the international community, and even if Europe has escaped relatively unscathed in this case, we must remain vigilant. SARS has not been wiped out and, as many have said this morning, other viruses are lying in wait for a new mutation that will make the leap to man, like bird flu.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why common sense, the relevance of the proposals made by our rapporteur, Mr Bowis – whom I also want to thank warmly here – and the quality of the compromise reached with the Irish Presidency require that tomorrow we applaud the rapid creation of this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying, this organisation will have many precise and vital tasks: the ability to respond swiftly to a viral epidemic or one deliberately caused by a bioterrorist attack, information to the public on all the risks of contamination, greater international cooperation, chiefly with the WHO of course. This centre will also – and I am not the first to say or reiterate it today – (and why not?) have to create a European network of laboratories and contribute to the search for vaccines for these diseases that are still resistant to antibiotics. The marketing of an antiviral vaccine or antiviral drugs is always a race against the clock and sometimes takes decades. That is why it is essential that we continue to invest as much in screening tests, I should say, as in inactivation technologies. In this connection, I note Commissioner Byrne’s commitment – as he said just now – to push the limits of the Treaty as far as he can in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in the short term, in 2005 that is, the Europe of the 25 will have its Disease Prevention and Control Centre, and we must look beyond that very strong signal to the sign of a Europe of health that is advancing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also congratulate the rapporteur on his immense efforts in negotiations with the Council to reach an agreement at first reading. I believe, in fact, that it is of the utmost importance that the Centre is operational as soon as possible in order to guarantee the health monitoring and the rapid alert system which must be provided by the Union in order adequately to tackle the challenges brought about by its imminent enlargement and by a globalised world which is increasingly unprotected against the spread of diseases still unknown to us: SARS in 2003 and the very recent bird flu are specific examples. I therefore consider that 1 January 2005 has to be the ultimate deadline for the launch of this Centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I would like to stress is the initial and refresher training for all health personnel in the Member States of the Union, and the Centre should be responsible for this. Ready for the entrance of ten new countries, the Union should aim to provide all health systems with the instruments, means and knowledge to create an effective synergy between all Member States and, in that way, to guarantee the coherence of the Union’s action proposed by the Centre.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by mentioning that the ability to respond adequately to an international health threat depends, to a large extent, on pre-emptively adopting preparatory plans for rapid action, coordinated at European level. The Centre should provide this essential service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the last twenty years, there have been reports of thirty new infectious diseases, or variations on old diseases caused by mutating viruses, or even the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, to give but one example. </p>
<p class="contents">All these crises in the public health sector, such as SARS and bird flu recently, have highlighted the weaknesses and gaps in existing structures. I hope that the Centre, with its small but adequate scientific operating structure, will be able to plug these gaps efficiently. However, if its work is to be satisfactory and efficient, it must be the central reference and coordination point for all the national surveillance centres and reference centres and laboratories of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur because not only did he accept the amendments which I proposed but, subsequently, in conjunction with them, two very important issues were approved and accepted which had not been included in the initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the development of the strategy of vaccinations, which are an extremely important weapon in combating the threat from infections diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">The second relates to the identification of topical public health issues and the promotion of the relevant, applied research, in order to reinforce our preventive capabilities and promote the efficiency of the coordinated action taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that we will also overcome these final hesitations and that the Centre will soon be up and running, even in its present, restricted form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bowis started his speech by saying that ‘he who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everything’. In that case, this morning, I feel very rich, for I have everything. I have hope, and that is everything. I have little more than that. I hope that the centre we are discussing today will very soon become operational.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Grossetête gave a very clear description of what this centre will have to be able to do in order to be effective. In essence, it will have to square the circle. With relatively few people, based a long way away in the north of the European Union, in Sweden, it will have to maintain intensive contact with all the Member States; it will have to motivate their health ministries, spend money and build up information networks, at the same time as maintaining contact with the Commission and with Parliament. Although this involves squaring a circle, I do have hope, and so, like Mr Bowis, I have everything.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot do other than agree wholeheartedly with Mrs Grossetête when she says that it is important that we do our work quickly, that it is important that we get things up and running. It follows, though, that the people who work there will have to be highly independent, work in very unconventional ways and possess imagination and the ability to work on their own initiative. By no means everyone can do these things. Looking at a number of other authorities that we have set up over the past few years, I have to say that their success is not exactly self-evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is the possibility of us coming to a different conclusion. As my fellow-Members have spoken about this Centre in great detail, I have to say what I would have liked to have seen. Hope, in my mind, is associated with aspiration. Of course communicable diseases are important, and of course the fight against them is important in terms of protecting the citizens of this European Union of ours, but let us be clear-sighted about the fact that most people in the European Union do not die of communicable diseases; they die of cancer, of heart attacks, and of strokes. How is it that it is a matter of chance whether you survive a heart attack, depending on whether you live in Berlin or in Madrid, or somewhere else? How is it that best practice in the treatment of cancer cases is not as yet established and communicated in the European Union? I regard that as an intolerable state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish we had been more ambitious and had said that the least we need is to link up best practice within the European Union in order to fight the real diseases that we have to cope with at the moment. Networking would have been within the competence of the European Union, and we could have afforded it. We did not manage it the first time round, but I hope we will, at the second attempt, ensure that people’s recovery from serious illness is not a matter of chance and does not depend on whether they live in the North, the South, the heart of Germany or on its plains, or in some other part of the European Union. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He not only nourishes our souls with the aphorism he chooses in each of his reports, but he also ensures that the report is clear, detailed and balanced. Such is the case this time too.</p>
<p class="contents">The agency for communicable diseases will be an immensely important body in the Union as infectious diseases have proved to be a major safety risk. With the enormous publicity they attract, they must be a significant factor in the insecurity the public feel. Bird flu has been a conspicuous topic of discussion recently, and AIDS is still unbeaten, to say nothing of older communicable diseases such as tuberculosis. Furthermore, the threat of bioterrorism is unfortunately a real one, as the anthrax letters we saw in 2001 showed.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Treaties the EU has a clear obligation here, and there are functional reasons that reinforce it: joint action in the preservation of public health and prevention of disease is more effective. For that reason, the aim to start the work of the agency promptly next year is absolutely the right one, and the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is firmly in favour of this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation under discussion thus intends to establish the agency promised for Sweden in the package agreed at the European Council in December. I would hope the farce over the multiannual aspect of the decision on the package will later on mean there will be an amendment to the decision-making process; although the decision to establish the new agency is obviously governed by the requirement of consensus in the Council, such a detail as its geographical location should be decided by a majority. As far as the balance of competences of the Union and the Member States is concerned, only the former system has importance. The latter only gives rise to national chauvinism, and that should be curbed where possible by revising the decision-making structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent SARS outbreak, the current threat of a biological terrorist attack and even the current Asian bird flu crisis illustrate the threat from disease in the global village that we live in today. The threat to Europe's health from the rapid spread of disease is real and present.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year 1.4 billion passengers fly on an international trip. Every one of them could pose a threat to global health security. If they were found to be carrying a new strain of influenza or SARS they could within a few hours unwittingly put the lives of millions at risk. Global warming threatens even Britain with diseases such as malaria, while diseases such as TB are already returning.</p>
<p class="contents">The correct response is not to turn our backs on the benefits of globalisation – we should not give up the opportunities presented by increases in trade and travel because of biological threats any more than for reasons of terrorism – but we need coordinated action. In today's world no one country can afford to go it alone. That is why Labour MEPs so firmly back these proposals for a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to tackling disease, Europe works. The European Commission was able to ban chicken imports from countries affected by the new strain of bird flu with immediate effect. Without the EU, it would have required an enormous effort to coordinate the actions of all 15 – and soon 25 – Member States. We need to strengthen that coordination and not weaken it through isolation. So I am pleased that Tory MEPs will also back this plan today. However, I wonder how they can square that with their own hostility to Europe and their policy of attacking the EU at every turn.</p>
<p class="contents">The centre will contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the prevention and monitoring of human diseases in the EU. Its technical work and research capabilities will be an asset, as will the work with the WHO. I agree that accessibility to information for the public is vital, and that is why the centre should have its own website to communicate its work and to publish its opinions.</p>

He really did have a very difficult brief, for initially it was not clear at all that our proposal would meet with general approval; the German Federal Government, for example, was very sceptical at first. Mrs Stihler may like to note that it was, in this respect, more Eurosceptic than the British Conservatives. Mr Bowis has managed to handle such a controversial topic in such a way that we are on the verge of reaching agreement, and that it really is possible to bring this matter to a conclusion at first reading and before enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was and is inconsistent for the European Union to have very strong competences when it comes to dealing with the diseases of animals, and to be able to take direct action, but that the same is not the case as regards the combating of diseases that affect human beings, and that, when human health is endangered, the first thing said is the magic word ‘subsidiarity’. I am all in favour of subsidiarity; I am not in favour of a European super-authority, nor of total harmonisation of health care provision, but this is where European action is right, as we saw from the many examples given in this morning’s debate on avian influenza. Whilst we have to use the Member States’ competences, this is something we have to bring together at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it right that we should take a pragmatic approach, by starting with communicable diseases – which are the most urgent problem at the moment – and then see where we go from there. I also think what Mr Trakatellis said was very important, namely that joint debate and the development of vaccination policies must be priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is addressed to the Council, represented here not by ministers but by officials. Many Members of this House have made reference to bio-terrorism. Over three months ago, I addressed a question on this issue to the Council, which it should, in the normal course of events, have answered after six weeks. I am still awaiting a reply. Bio-terrorism is too important an issue for us to allow ourselves such delays. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political pressure to have the centre set up and running as soon as possible reflects the needs and concerns of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Europe of today, where millions of people cross national borders every day, we need to be in a position to take rapid, coordinated action at EU level to best protect the health of our citizens. This is precisely what the centre aims to achieve. By pooling our scientific expertise and reinforcing our rapid alert systems, the ECDC will allow better preparation and swifter and more effective responses to disease outbreaks.</p>
<p class="contents">In summing up this morning's debate, I would like to focus on three central issues in the proposal which have been key areas of concern: the mission and the tasks of the centre; the possible extension of its sphere of operation; and the composition of the management board. There is broad agreement between the institutions on the initial scope of the centre. We all agree that it should start with communicable diseases and be able to respond to cases of unexpected outbreaks of unknown origin. The Council and Parliament share the view that there needs to be an external evaluation to assess the feasibility of extending the scope based on the performance and impact of the centre, as resources permit.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the budget for the centre will dictate its expansion, and beyond 2006 this has to be decided within the new financial perspectives. To enable the centre to start, and for it to make an impact, the Commission is prepared to accept this approach, but it means that when the question of the need to extend its remit arises we should – and would – expect Parliament and the Council to address such a proposal rapidly, under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the organisational aspects of the centre, the proposal provides for responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre to be granted to the director. The advisory forum is the place for the director to seek advice from his or her peers – and the forum would ensure the shared ownership of this venture with the Member States. The Commission can accept the extension of the membership of the advisory forum to stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations and academics. It will be an advantage for the director to have broader views when developing the operation of the centre.</p>
<p class="contents">The management board should steer policy and make decisions. The Commission’s proposal balances this dual responsibility in a way which we consider to be the most efficient and transparent. This approach is based on the principles defined in the Commission communication on the governance of European Agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">In a resolution adopted last month, Parliament welcomed this communication, recognising the need to limit the size of the boards of the agencies. The Commission wants to follow a consistent approach on this matter, as currently each agency seems to follow a different path. I now note that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on a board for the ECDC to consist of one representative per Member State, three from the Commission and two from Parliament. The Commission considers that a board of 30 members is unwieldy and may hamper the decision-making process. Although, given the competences involved and being exercised here, I agree with the rapporteur that a good case can be made for one member per Member State being on the board. The Commission notes, however, the terms of the compromise supported by Council and Parliament and is therefore willing, despite our concerns, to go along with this compromise, given the importance that it attaches to the rapid establishment of the centre.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes that the evaluation provided for in Article 31 of the regulation will cover the working practises of the centre, including the composition and functioning of the management board.</p>
<p class="contents">A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In short, this states that the Commission accepts all amendments that are part of the compromise package as set out by the rapporteur. I also join with the rapporteur in urging that amendments <span class="italic">outside</span> the package should not – and cannot – be accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by thanking the rapporteur and Parliament. When I formulated this idea in my mind some years ago, I not only got the support that I would expect from my own services, but also very strong support from Parliament. We should be proud of ourselves today. By voting tomorrow on this issue we are reacting in a timely way in circumstances where we see communicable diseases on a global basis. We have discussed it in the last debate here in Parliament. We can proudly say to our citizens that we are responding well and quickly to their needs in relation to issues associated with communicable disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes we can be unduly pessimistic and critical of ourselves. This is one occasion where we can stand up and say that we have done our work well and quickly, we have responded to the needs, and we can look our citizens in the eye and tell them that we have done our work well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
