I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, and the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for their work and constant interest in science and research matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this agreement is to enable continued cooperation with Israel in the field of science and technology. This relationship has been developing ever since Israel's participation in the Fourth Framework Programme for research. I would also emphasise the importance of this cooperation within the framework of the development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, as well as in the implementation of the European Research Area. The present agreement is an extension of the one associating Israel with the activities of the Fifth Framework Programme for research and technological development. The latter is based on the fundamental principle of reciprocity, which takes into account the mutual interests of the two parties and covers all the fields suggested by the Sixth Framework Programme, with the exception of nuclear research.</p>
<p class="contents">Scientific cooperation with Israel has already resulted in numerous joint projects in the field of research and technological development. Under the Fifth Framework Programme, 623 projects were undertaken by European research teams in association with Israeli teams, who coordinated 149 of those projects. The public and private partners engaged in this cooperation have stressed the value of that cooperation and the benefits of it. This was emphasised during the evaluation of the impact of the agreement associating Israel to the Fifth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress the value of this type of agreement for the development for Euro-Mediterranean regional scientific cooperation. For example, the Hortimed project associates Israel and neighbouring countries such as Egypt, the Palestinian Territories, Cyprus and Greece in the search for economic and sustainable solutions for the use of water in irrigated horticulture, particularly by using recycled and cleaned water.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major element, mentioned previously, is the contribution this agreement makes to the implementation of the European Research Area and its opening-up to the rest of the world. More generally, it also contributes to the development of a knowledge-based society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission is willing to promote international cooperation in scientific and technological matters with third country partners. The Cooperation Agreement with Israel fits naturally into this strategy, particularly in respect of the Middle East. The agreement should also enable scientists to continue their efforts for regional cooperation with the countries neighbouring Israel for the benefit of all, and this in the difficult circumstances currently prevailing in the Middle East. I am therefore convinced that Parliament should and will give its support to the conclusion of this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Quisthoudt-Rowohl (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, on 20 November 1995 a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement was concluded between the European Union and Israel by which Israel became associated with the EU in the fields of the movement of goods and services, the right of establishment, the movement of capital and economic and cultural cooperation. This institutionalised a political dialogue with Israel, which was already taking place on a highly regular basis. The EU also maintains a special relationship with the autonomous Palestinian Authority and is one of the partners in the Middle East peace process. I have thus now mentioned the two elements that are crucial to the consideration of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1975 Israel and the European Union had been cooperating in the field of research and development, and in 1983, they began jointly to finance research projects, and, as Commissioner Bolkestein has already said, Israel participated fully in the Fifth Framework Programme; I was the rapporteur on this association at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements were and are a recognition of the international nature of research at the end of the twentieth century, and also recognise that to limit research to EU territory would frequently be contrary to its best interests. There is a very innovative research climate in Israel, which, relative to its GDP, still spends more on research than does the EU, and is a world leader as regards the number of scientific publications per capita. I do not propose to repeat the figures to which reference has already been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Both sides have benefited from cooperation under the Fifth Framework Programme: Israel gains access to a more extensive network of research institutes, while the EU is able to tap Israel’s innovative potential. Just how successful this cooperation has been is shown, among other things, by the large number of projects supported. Some projects have partners not only from Israel, but also from the entire Mediterranean. Water treatment has already been mentioned; there are also institutes in the areas under the autonomous Palestinian Authority that participate successfully in our Research Programme. Let me take this opportunity of repeating, for the benefit of some in this House, that this report does not envisage any research cooperation in the sphere of military research or under the aegis of Euratom.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption: ‘Shame!’)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As in the two previous Agreements, Israel is expected to contribute financially to the Sixth FP in proportion to its GDP. It participates in the programme as a partner with the same rights and obligations as EU Member States: the only exception is the Scientific and Technical Research Committee (CREST), in which it is only an observer.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel’s contribution to our research funds and the know-how provided by Israeli institutes can only be seen as positive for EU participants, and so we are very definitely in a win-win-situation here<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement the Agreement, a Joint Committee will be set up, which will ensure the involvement of Israeli officials in the administrative committees and the participation of experts to give their expertise and in programme committees.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no obstacle, then, from the research point of view, to the extension of the Agreement. In order that this statement should not be misunderstood, let me quote from a letter written to me by the Israeli Ambassador, Oded Eran, who had this to say: ‘As you pointed out, the overall situation in the Middle East and specifically between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is far from being ideal at the moment. And the whole Middle East peace process is facing a critical test.’<span class="italic"> </span>I therefore sympathise with those who tabled the amendments, who are opposed to this and believe that we should put every form of cooperation with Israel on ice until such time as peace prevails in this region, which is so sadly lacking in it. I have to say, though, that it is my firm conviction that shutting doors prevents us from cooperating further. Let us be prepared to have frank discussions with all sides, for that is the only way in which we will be able to influence the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that, from the research point of view, the Agreement is very much to be welcomed. This cooperation will benefit not only researchers and research institutes in the EU, but businesses too, and, where the political situation is concerned, I am persuaded that it can help to ease tensions, as Palestinian researchers and institutes will be enabled to work together with their Israeli and European counterparts, and those who work together are not fighting each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by thanking all those, on every side, with whom I have had discussions – those in favour, those against, those who will benefit and those who wanted changes made – from whom I have had a great deal of support and with whom I have, in any case, been able to have very calm and relaxed dialogue. I thank you all, and hope that my report will make it through tomorrow with the backing of a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, this agreement cannot be straightforward. From the scientific point of view, collaboration with Israel is no doubt useful in the Sixth Framework Programme. It is a strong scientific country and, as we have heard, some very useful Mediterranean-wide projects, including research into water treatment, have been carried out and could be carried out in future. However, we are not discussing a normal country or a normal part of the world. Israel is not a normal country because many of the present government's actions are completely unacceptable: building a fence, occupying territory, breaching human rights, using repression. Despite some joint scientific work with Palestinians, I have had complaints regarding barriers to some of that work.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group considered very carefully whether to vote in favour of this agreement. There are two perfectly valid, tenable points of view. One could say – as some will – that signing or ratifying this agreement will be perceived as giving the green light and an encouraging signal and endorsement to the actions of the Israeli Government. That is certainly not the intention. In the past the European Parliament has very successfully asked for scientific cooperation to be frozen. Some Members advocate voting against this agreement and indeed taking much further action to show the Israeli Government our disapproval. A second alternative – and the one that I recommend – is to consider that science and research are positive, that the results of that work are of benefit to human beings and that this allows dialogue and provides an opening for work with Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Other points can certainly – and probably will – be made in political dialogue. There may be cause for action elsewhere. We have had long discussions and have come to the conclusion, in majority – although not unanimously – that the second alternative, to put faith in the possibility that the scientific dialogue, without any endorsement of the Israeli Government's actions, will bring some progress. We have great reservations. We want Palestinian participation without barriers or handicaps. Of course we want no nuclear, military or dual-use research. We want a very close monitoring of the situation. We want the EU-Israel Research Committee to report regularly so that we can see whether this act of faith in the value of science has been worthwhile or has been misinterpreted by a government whose actions we condemn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nothing has changed since, or at least very little. Indeed a recent delegation from this Parliament, which looked at the effects of the so-called security fence or wall, had deeply shocking things to report. I believe that an acceptance of this agreement would be an indication of normality and cooperation and as my colleague Mrs McNally said, this is not a normal country, it is not a normal situation, and it should not be endorsed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Verts/ALE Group has therefore tabled amendments asking for the suspension of this agreement in the present situation, particularly because of its unequal benefit for one protagonist – Israel – and until more progress has been made towards realistic conflict resolution in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also requested that dual-use technology with a potential military application be excluded from this agreement. It would be extremely strange if the European Parliament did not support this last request. However, to my great surprise and disappointment, I believe Members will not be able to vote on that amendment. That is a political, not a technical, decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans have a historic responsibility for the problems in this region. These are responsibilities that we are far from bearing and properly discharging. I would ask you to support the amendments I have tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group has decided to distinguish between the scientific and technical nature of the report and the political nature of the conflict, while condemning the attitude of the Sharon Government which – with its policy of indiscriminate killings, with the construction of a wall which steals even more Palestinian territory and its failure to evacuate settlements – is blocking the Quartet's roadmap and making it increasingly difficult to establish a viable Palestinian State. Furthermore, my group believes that on the issue of scientific and technical cooperation we should take particular account of the society which may benefit from that cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking now on my own personal behalf, I would like to say the following: in the explanatory statement, the rapporteur acknowledges that the extension of the agreement, and I quote, ‘comes at a politically critical time in which the Middle East peace process is floundering’. I would say that floundering is something of an understatement. It is in such serious danger that only decisive action on the part of the Quartet, which so far has not been taken, could save it. The rapporteur also says that, and I quote, ‘it may help ease the tensions, since it will also enable Palestinian researchers and institutions to work together with Israeli and European institutes’. I frankly doubt that this would be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a situation of military occupation which goes much further than the concept of ‘tension’. And, furthermore, I believe that Palestinian researchers and research institutions will find it very difficult to benefit when they are surrounded by a wall which denies them freedom of movement and which encloses them in ghettos and Bantustans which bring shame on humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I think Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and my colleague Mrs McNally have both done a very good job of explaining their divergent positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever there is a situation of problematic political conflict – and it goes without saying that Israel is one – this House finds it difficult to come to a decision. I do believe, though, that it is a good thing to clarify what is involved, what we want to achieve, and what message this House is sending out by endorsing the position taken by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This has to do with the continuation of cooperation and dialogue that are already going on in scientific and technological circles, and that benefit both sides. Contrary to what has been said by some Members, this is not just about the eventual benefit to Israel; we too will benefit. Not only will this benefit scientists, university departments and research institutes; humanity itself will benefit from cooperation and exchange between scientists, in which politicians too will have their part to play, and, as a fellow Member pointed out, society as a whole will benefit. We are investing in a future in which – or so we hope – Europe will be able to do its bit in resolving a situation that is, in political and human terms, extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am both proud and glad that Mrs McNally, as my group’s coordinator, has, in the group’s discussions, always emphasised that we would endorse this report. On just one small point, I would like to point out to the Members in the Group of the Greens, who have difficulties with the ‘dual use’<span class="italic"> </span>aspect<span class="italic">,</span> that the European Union does not support any military research, nor does our research programme cover it, so any cooperation in that area is automatically ruled out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is denying the political dimension of human rights under Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement and contradicting the Barcelona process based on respect for fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel systematically violates human rights in territories occupied by colonisation and occupation, violates democratic principles with regard to thousands of Palestinians, Israeli citizens, victims of discrimination. Israel is violating the Geneva Convention, international law, the United Nations Charter and the Vienna Convention by not respecting the trade clauses of its association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a real human, ecological and political disaster. It is an annexation, undermining the creation of a Palestinian State, ghettoising Palestinians and ruining all hopes of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU cannot have trade or scientific relations with a third country without taking into consideration the abuses of international law that it is guilty of. Given that the EU reacted in the former Yugoslavia and in Africa, refusing to be complicit or complacent in the face of violations of humanitarian law, why should it keep silent in the case of Israel? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
