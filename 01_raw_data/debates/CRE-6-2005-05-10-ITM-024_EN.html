<p class="contents">Today, we salute the way in which Mr Padóa-Schioppa, the predecessor of the person whose candidature we are to examine, carried out his duties on the Executive Board. I believe that in his relations with our institution and more widely in his capacity as the Executive Board’s external representative, he showed great talent and a thorough grasp of these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate whose nomination we are to examine today is Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi. Your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been able to question him first of all in writing following the questionnaire procedure with which we are familiar and then verbally at a hearing, where the members of the committee reached a consensus. We were able to check that there is no doubt as to his expertise and professional ability in the light of the job he will have to do. He has all the abilities to be a good central banker together with two additional assets I would like to mention: an ability to communicate, which is certainly very useful for a central banker, and also a vision enriched by a multidisciplinary approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether the mindset of a central banker is enough to make a good Executive Board member, or whether it requires a broader vision and outlook is something we have debated a number of times. It seems to us that Mr Bini Smaghi will be able to contribute this multidisciplinary approach to the Executive Board’s discussions and that this will make monetary policy more responsive to the needs of the real economy and to the public’s aspirations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe he has demonstrated skill, respect for his institutional responsibilities and a professionalism that is beyond all suspicion; a professionalism that has also been demonstrated by Mr Bini Smaghi throughout his career. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission does not participate in the formal procedure for selecting and appointing members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, but it has been lucky enough to work with and know Mr Bini Smaghi for a long time in his role as a highly qualified and very experienced economist in the Banca d'Italia and in his work within the Italian administration and also within the context of his very active participation in the Economic and Financial Committee, within which, until he was appointed as a member of the Executive Board and of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, he has been chairman of the subcommittee on monetary and financial affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe him to be an absolutely ideal person to carry out the duties being entrusted to him and, therefore, although, as I have said, we do not participate in a formal manner, we will be extremely pleased if Parliament supports this appointment, just as the Ecofin Council did. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a final comment. The Commission does not participate in the procedure, but it is the guardian of the Treaties, and we have monitored extremely closely whether the Treaties and the rules in force have been complied with throughout all the stages of Mr Bini Smaghi’s appointment. They have, in fact; I had the opportunity to say so during the Ecofin meeting that unanimously proposed him as a candidate. However, I would like to take this opportunity to say that there are still four Member States of the eurozone which have yet to participate in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland and Portugal). </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that during the last two replacements of members of the Executive Board of the Central Bank, the institutions have appointed people of the same nationality as the person being replaced in no way prevents the Commission from pointing out that the procedure must not take account of the nationality of the outgoing person, but rather of the professional competence of the new candidate, as has undoubtedly been the case here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are grateful to him for his work and for his cooperation with us. Having endorsed his successor’s nomination, we are in agreement about his qualifications too; we take a favourable view of him, and wish him every success.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this debate as a starting point, by saying that I agree with the Commissioner, that there must be nothing automatic about nominations being made by certain countries, and that it would have been a good thing if we had had several candidates for the seats available, and hence a competing array of qualities, principles, opinions and fundamental beliefs to choose from. That this was not the case on this occasion is no discredit to Mr Bini Smaghi, but it is something we have to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it has to be said that the European Central Bank plays a very important role, and does it very well, by virtue of its independence, and also as the euro’s guardian and the driving force behind it. We would urge Mr Bini Smaghi to join his fellow Executive Board members in upholding these principles. In this respect, the changes to the Stability and Growth Pact will give the European Central Bank an even more important role, in cooperation with the Commission. One thing I think we should do is to compare the two sets of statistics that we are given, in order to ensure that there are no discrepancies in the way countries are assessed; I am also thinking here of the ECB’s public statements and assessments as guardian of price stability, as regards the size of the Member States’ budgets, the things they spend their budgets on and the breakdown of their tax receipts. What we need is a strong and independent Central Bank, enabling the euro to continue on its successful course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Personally, I feel that I must point out the candidate’s timely support and defence of the Constitutional Treaty. His appointment offers us the opportunity to reiterate some of the aspects that have proved crucial in the European Central Bank’s approach to the EU’s economic situation and especially its contribution to a swift and solid recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Smaghi’s appointment follows the Council’s decision that significantly amended the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact and that was intended to improve its procedures. The ECB is known to have initially been opposed to any changes in the regulations, and even went as far as to threaten to raise interest rates. It later came to accept the changes laid down by the Council, but always did so tentatively and conservatively.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is true that the Stability and Growth Pact comprises a pillar for preventing and a pillar for remedying, it is also true that this political, economic and financial instrument must be implemented across the board. It is unacceptable that so-called relevant factors and exceptional circumstances, now identified and formalised by the Council, should be reduced to small amendments to the regulations in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The reading of the document adopted by the Council is clear and unequivocal, and indeed comprises substantial amendments to the model currently in force. To ignore this fact, or simply to reduce it to formalities and cosmetic amendments, is completely wrong. Despite all of the ECB’s efforts to control and keep a lid on prices, and its indisputable success in achieving this aim, the EU’s economy is a long way from showing clear signs of recovery and has certainly not managed to solve the main problem, which is unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Monetary Fund indeed recently urged the ECB to reduce interest rates again. This forms part of the new framework adopted by the Council for supervising, monitoring and remedying fiscal imbalances. What is at stake is not wholesale budgetary deregulation, but the EU’s economic and social recovery, for which the ECB must take a great deal of credit. The ECB’s executive board must not overlook this inevitability and the newly-appointed board Member must ensure that it is on his political agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although he is a rigorous scholar recognised for being straightforward and highly competent, he has declared himself in favour of policies that are utterly unacceptable. At the end of the hearing he upheld the need for the ECB not to cut interest rates. He supported ratification of the Constitution, of course, because in fact it facilitates the work of the European Central Bank. For us, the ECB is the mother of all usury: it actually deprives the paper money that it allows to be printed of its exchange value and controls the interest rates applied by the Member States’ banks, thus subjecting consumers to extortionate terms. In addition, he said that he supports the Stability Pact, which limits the freedom of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lorenzo Bini Smaghi has publicly stated that the institutions created by the Bretton-Woods Agreements – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – hold the stability of the international financial system among their rightful objectives, but he does not agree that, for the sake of such stability, they have contributed to poverty and a widening of the gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ECB represent the interests of a tiny minority of technocrats and of big transnational finance, which grows rich on financial speculation. These are institutions that have decreed the ruin of whole nations: just think of the case of Yugoslavia, first strangled by extortionate interest rates and then crushed, destroyed and dismembered.</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore certainly not voting against the person, who is someone we admire, but against an institution that we cannot accept and in fact positively condemn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I look forward to working with him.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have some comments. First, regarding the Stability and Growth Pact, Mr Bini Smaghi’s answers to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs revealed some inconsistencies in judgement, which I wish briefly to point out. While his commentary on the legal uncertainties of the old SGP is valid, his interpretation of the dynamic conditions leading to the reform of the pact is questionable. Mr Bini Smaghi seems to imply that the pact’s own rigidities led to certain Member States breaking its rules and that the politics of the SGP made sensible economics impossible. This is disappointing from someone about to be installed at the ECB. The truth is that the SGP was torn apart by the political inability of some Member States to conduct sensible economic policies on the basis of the rules agreed to by all, long after they came into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind Mr Bini Smaghi that without effective rules that are equally applicable to all, the EU would be nothing but a loose grouping with weak powers of coordination. Surely, as a member of the ECB Board, he cannot favour development that would increase economic asymmetry between eurozone Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding his nomination itself, the rules that govern which eurozone Member States obtain seats on the ECB Board need to be clarified. They should be based on genuinely open mechanisms of selecting nominees. The present system too often seems to favour automatic entry for candidates from big eurozone Member States at the direct expense of smaller ones. Smaller Member States are excluded from the backroom deals that decide the posts. This is truly regrettable and potentially damaging in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">With these qualifications in mind, I once again congratulate Mr Bini Smaghi on his nomination. I am not against his nomination but I am concerned about the more general circumstances surrounding it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recently, I questioned the fact that the ECB had decided to double its printing of EUR 500 banknotes this year – the highest value banknotes in the world and the Russian mafia’s currency of choice, each one worth seven times a USD 100 bill. Last year, counterfeit EUR 500 notes rose by over 160%, and that is only the ones we know about. The Commission’s reply to my questions would have stunned even a simpleton. It said, ‘a strong demand for high-value notes could be met only by lower denominations and increasing printing costs’. Can you imagine that as a serious answer from a central bank? The reply went on, ‘EUR 500 banknotes are widely used for hoarding purposes’ – surprise, surprise! And finally, ‘there are no indications that high-denomination banknotes encourage illegal transactions’. Which planet do they live on? The ECB must be out of its tiny collective mind to encourage the wider circulation of such banknotes, and I believe Mr Smaghi has much work to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
