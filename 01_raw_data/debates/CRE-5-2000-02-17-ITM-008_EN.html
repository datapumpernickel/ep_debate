Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here. We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them. I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends. I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers. But I – and many Members with me – also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate. We need to cooperate with the Council too. I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done. I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council. I think we should give this some thought. I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament. </p>

First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender. I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far. I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo. I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia. I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo. I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic’s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen. Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked. You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops. I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti. I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange. Why not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sakellariou (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, firstly I would like to take the floor to respond to the verbal attack that Mr Dupuis has just made on me, and this should not be deducted from my allotted speaking time. That was a personal declaration, Mr President, and I would like to add that my Group has asserted in a unanimous decision that under no circumstances do we wish to join forces with those who intend to sit with Mr Le Pen and the other right-wing extremists in this Parliament, in a compromise resolution or any other form of cooperation. We will not support a joint resolution; we will not conduct negotiations with them and we will not recognise their signatures on a resolution of this kind. That is what I wanted to say about the incident that Mr Dupuis spoke of.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Together with NATO, EU Member States waged a war for the sake of Kosovo. They declared that this war was needed to uphold human rights. I do not propose, at this point, to start yet another discussion on the effectiveness of the methods at our disposal for dealing with crises. My fellow delegates are well acquainted with my scepticism as to the legitimacy of military intervention and the effectiveness thereof. I accept that NATO and the individual Member States were in favour of getting involved in an operation of this kind, and that they believed that this was the only option remaining to them to put an end to the ever-increasing violations of human rights and crimes perpetrated by the Milosevic regime in Kosovo, and secure a dignified existence for the Albanian people.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Intervention did not succeed in preventing a human catastrophe; Kosovo is destroyed, fields cannot be cultivated, production centres are out of action and the economy is in a chaotic state. Serbia’s development has been set back decades and the people – Serbians and Kosovo Albanians alike – will be traumatised for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">But the violations of human rights go further, and supporters of the Milosevic regime were not the only ones to trample human rights underfoot; sadly, those whom NATO set out to defend are guilty of the same. Disputes have been going on for months. Hundreds of Serbs had to leave Kosovo and we have just heard that KFOR soldiers are now coming under attack as well, along with refugee buses and the like in the vicinity of Mitrovica.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is only a fraction of the ongoing acts of aggression against Serbs, Roma and other minorities, which are not just taking place in Mitrovica alone. Our commitment to Kosovo obliges us not to look away now either, when there are new violations of human rights, irrespective of who initiates them. Otherwise, we will lose all credibility. </p>
<p class="contents">This throws up another fundamental question: how effective are international protectorates? Can a protectorate be a panacea, or is it not more likely to entrench the ethnic divide within the protected province? Is it at all realistic to undertake to build a multicultural society in a protectorate following military intervention? I believe we must ask ourselves these questions or else we will not be able to find a solution for Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">And I would like, very briefly, to make some specific and practical proposals that will enable us to arrive at this solution. The national governments must despatch the required international police force to Kosovo with all haste, i.e. immediately. The donor states must release the promised financial aid so that the international representatives actually have the means at their disposal for fulfilling their tasks. The KPC, the Kosovo Protection Corps, must be investigated following suspicions that some members are involved in criminal activity, and appropriate steps must be taken. Finally, there is the demand that this Parliament made in the case of the last resolution: the representative of the UNO Secretary-General must build an administration there that will truly work in Kosovo’s interests.</p>

If you sign something with Mr Modrow then you could do so with Mr Dupuis and others. Mr Modrow belongs to the Communist Group and is one of the last leaders of the DDR. If you sign something with him then you must also consider whether you were in earnest when you said what you did to Mr Dupuis.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Returning to urgent matters: unfortunately, as much as we may want to, we will be unable to solve the general problems facing Kosovo during today’s urgency debate. Nor is this the right time for us to consider the questions put by Mr Dupuis. We cannot ask today what is to become of Kosovo. That is really something we should do in a foreign affairs debate. We are here today to deal with an urgent topic, that of having to discuss, for the second time, a motion on the subject of Albanian Kosovan prisoners in Serbia. I really have to wonder why we adopted this motion last September. I have neither read nor heard that the Council has taken it to heart.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I really have to wonder if the Council has even a scrap of the least compassion one should feel for one’s fellow human beings. If the representatives of the Council had sons, brothers or fathers in the prisons in Serbia then I feel there would be a more rapid response. In common with you all, I too have heard the cries for help uttered by the mothers, wives and daughters of Albanian Kosovans sitting in Serbian prisons. To be quite honest, though, not a soul is helping them.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I was in Pristina recently and searched in vain for three students at the university, whom I have known for years. I know where they are: they are in Serb prisons, yet they have done nothing, I repeat nothing! There is no reason for them to be there. They have not come to anyone’s attention for terrorist or military reasons. I therefore believe that we must take up this cause.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Albanian doctor, Flora Brovina, who was sentenced in Niš on 13 January, is now in a prison hospital and is extremely ill. She was sentenced because she gave assistance as a doctor to all wounded people, irrespective of where they came from. She was neither a terrorist nor a UCK activist. But not a soul is helping this woman to get out of prison.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Council of Ministers has no interest whatsoever in tragedies of this kind. That is tragic to my mind. Things have come to a pretty pass when we MEPs pass on the cries for help and none of those in positions of responsibility hear them. The sanctions are now slowly being relaxed. Did it never occur to anyone to make the relaxation of sanctions conditional on the Serbian Government actually doing something about this? It seems not. </p>
<p class="contents">We should also consider the situation in Mitrovica, and I concede that Mr Sakellariou is absolutely right about this. It is not just the Serbs that we must demand civilised behaviour from, we must now call upon those to whose aid we went to refrain from avenging terror with terror. Otherwise we will be just as lacking in credibility. And so that is why I believe that we must call upon the people to whom we provided assistance to behave in a truly civilised manner.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mitrovica must not remain divided. We have had enough divided cities in Europe and still have them. I believe we must prevent this from happening. If attacks are now being made on KFOR then all I can say is that these are our sons and we sent them there to help the Albanians and the Serbs and anyone else living in Kosovo. We are entitled to expect them not to be punished for serving in Kosovo of their volition. Hence I expect everyone there, be they Albanian or Serb, to leave the KFOR troops in peace.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I endorse what Mr Sakellariou had to say. The international community must send the police force it has been promising them at long last. A third of this force is there, two thirds are yet to come, and I believe this is what we need to do.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to point out that something terrible is going on in Serbia at present. Mr Seselj, this nationalist, who is actually a war criminal, is obstructing the last vestige of press freedom they have over there. We must clamp down on this or else we will be unable to receive any accurate information whatsoever from the Serbian people!</p>

Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge. The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on. The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed. He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000. The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them. Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained. However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up. I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew. The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace. After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers. By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place. Atrocities were not even being recorded. Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn. I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe? Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad? I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place? And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities? I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic’s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified. But NATO’s decision for military intervention and the KLA’s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power. It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence. In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups. Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands. Flora Brovina’s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade. This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia. It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned. She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union must do likewise. The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What she has said here is completely justified.</p>
<p class="contents">There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several. I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse – that is bending the truth. I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us. We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why. There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part. </p>
<p class="contents">We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners. There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo. The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails. They ask us where their children are, their sons. We need to be able to go back with a proper answer. The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many. We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners. The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I may not always be of the same mind as Mr Dupuis but what I would like to say is that he is a confirmed democrat, and hitherto it was customary in this House for people to negotiate with each other. If that is to change then rules must be laid down, and we must also put a stop to your group, as well as other groups, regularly starting joint initiatives with the group that Mr Modrow belongs to, Mr Modrow being the only Member of this House who for decades served a criminal regime, that of the Berlin Wall murderers, in a prominent capacity. I would like to make this quite plain to you all, so as to avoid any crossed wires. We must ensure that clear, democratic criteria pertaining to a state under the rule of law are then established.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As to the issue itself, I would like to say that although the Council was rightly criticised for its failure to attend – and I would second this – yesterday, during Question Time, we had a debate with the Council on Kosovo lasting an hour and ten minutes. The Council behaved relatively well but I am ashamed of what this House had to say for, with few exceptions, all we could talk about was that there are more serious attacks and worse human rights violations going on in Kosovo today than there were before NATO intervened. It was even suggested that NATO ought to be brought before the Court of Justice in The Hague. This was an atrocious way to go on and I simply have to say that it produced a distorted image of the opinion of this House. </p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very pleased with the motion that has been worked out with a large consensus today, for we must get something straight: attacks are currently taking place, as are unresolved and regrettable incidents, but what we do not have, thank God, is the mass expulsion of hundreds of thousands or millions of people, brought about by state-sanctioned violence. That is what NATO intervention brought to an end. That is why NATO does not deserve to go to The Hague, rather this House ought to have awarded it the Sakharov prize.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make quite plain that we too must be sure to stand by the commitments we made in this respect. We assumed responsibility for Kosovo, with all the consequences that entails, but of course this means that in view of the conflicts that are taking place – and it stands to reason that this should be so – we must see to it that a functioning civil administration is set up again with all haste. I would like to lend my express support to Bertel Haarder and others, who said that we must make the building up of police and judicial structures our priority. We have failed miserably on this front. The first mistake was that this task was transferred to the UN, which is definitely failing to get to grips with it. The second mistake is that many States, including the Member States, are not living up to their commitments, particularly those of a financial nature.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We hear about the reconstruction of Kosovo and the Stability Pact, but all of that is very much in keeping with the culture of announcements that is very much the ‘in thing’ these days. In other words, millions and billions are promised and announced but only a relatively small proportion of this sees the light of day. I also call upon the Commission – and I know that Commissioner Patten is one of the best Commissioners we have – to make a huge effort here and ensure that the whole host of announcements made by the States – not the EU, the individual States that is – actually materialise. Otherwise there will be a steady stream of outrages and attacks and any attempts to establish rule of law will come to nought.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As for Serbia and the thousands of abducted Albanians who continue to languish in prisons in Yugoslavia, I would like to make the following point quite plain: it is absolutely scandalous that the Council is beginning to lift sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, that those on the left of this House are demanding that more sanctions be lifted, yet not one of these motions states that this is inextricably linked by way of a condition with the release of political prisoners in Serbia, including Kosovan Albanians. We must gain in credibility and act clearly and robustly in the interests of democracy and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner. In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers. The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800. To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal. Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany. </p>
<p class="contents">It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region. What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner’s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days. Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region. </p>
<p class="contents">For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement. According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds. I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos’s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely ‘spicy’ matters which we need to go into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment. However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them. Yet this is not the situation. Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship. It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on. The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House. As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola. These cases keep occurring. Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola. The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.</p>
<p class="contents">I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa. It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups. The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits. It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry. It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">This war must be stopped. The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes. The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster. This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region. This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly. These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted. It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola. We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant. The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible. Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made. We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people. We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades. The people of Angola deserve better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are now expressing our horror concerning this war. Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country’s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children. This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame. The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists – more than 20 were imprisoned last year – keep speaking their minds. </p>
<p class="contents">We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things. We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop. But what do these sanctions mean? It is the western world itself which is partly to blame. It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there. The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame. </p>
<p class="contents">This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.</p>

On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year’s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000. The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President’s cabinet. The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness. Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party. </p>
<p class="contents">These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics. Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security. Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government. </p>
<p class="contents">Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month. But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government. </p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola. On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts. I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Angola is a test case. We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect. Once again, an indigenous people’s right of existence is being threatened. Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest. Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet’s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned. But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope. There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands. It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health. </p>
<p class="contents">It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life. It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms. </p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.

<p class="contents">This is why it is necessary – and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution – that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed. We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament. The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened. </p>

With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold – and, later on, uranium and oil – all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination. The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history. </p>
<p class="contents">It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land. The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian ‘Mother Earth’ organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation. This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.

The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries. The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples. </p>
<p class="contents">This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms. The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them – the land of their forefathers – but also any prospect of work and sources of income. </p>
<p class="contents">The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry. Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives. The population was not allowed any input. This resembles a kind of trade in human beings. </p>
<p class="contents">The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium. After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world’s most contaminated areas. </p>
<p class="contents">The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field. </p>
<p class="contents">It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians. This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups. So let us contact the United States now! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have repeatedly pointed out in this House that the Chechen war was a particularly bloody form of election campaign and seizure of power for Mr Putin. When one considers what Mr Putin has done in the few weeks since his velvet putsch on New Year’s day in Russia, then one will see that not only did he step up the genocidal activities in Chechnya, he also initiated changes in Russian domestic policy that cause one to fear the worst. The Babitsky case illustrates perfectly how press freedom is under serious threat in Russia – which is, after all, a Member of the Council of Europe, indeed its largest Member, and which has joined forces with the European Union in a partnership agreement.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Putin said himself that Mr Babitsky was taken into custody by the Russian secret service on his orders. He said himself that he made the case a matter for decision at the highest level. He maintained that he has the case in hand. Then we hear that he has allegedly handed this case, which was supposedly a matter for decision at the highest level, a Russian citizen that is, over to people that he has declared to be dangerous terrorists. What kind of state hands its own citizens over to people it deems to be dangerous terrorists? Then after the initial confusion the Chechens issued a clear denial. Russian civil rights campaigners and the Russian democratic forces who stand in opposition are making it quite clear that Mr Babitsky is obviously still in the custody of the FSB. There is a great deal still to be explained about this case.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This House must urge the Russian Government in no uncertain terms, firstly to launch an immediate inquiry into what has happened to Mr Babitsky and secondly to intervene in order to secure his release and ensure that press freedom and the rule of law are not compromised still further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky’s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky’s life and freedom. This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament’s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity. </p>

<p class="contents">The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy. It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.</p>

Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.

Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question. The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.</p>
<p class="contents">I am using the phrase ‘is said to be’ on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist. For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country’s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely. Russia’s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: ‘As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.’ </p>
<p class="contents">This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising. The facts are clear. Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin’s ‘anti-terrorist’ operation in Chechnya. Hence his disappearance of over one month. In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy. Nor is it a mere luxury. Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced. Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.

<p class="contents">Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists. Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, ‘We cannot release him: he is a war criminal’.</p>
<p class="contents">In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance. If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations. This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.</p>

These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie. Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason. In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death. </p>
<p class="contents">In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie’s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal. In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister. This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm. In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid. The pattern of intimidation is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree. All this is happening on a daily basis. Even more serious is the government’s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased. The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union’s relations with Cambodia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world – Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia – where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails. Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation. In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society. Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities. We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim. We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past. We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order. In this regard we strongly support the High Representative’s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo. It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects. It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity. We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons. I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement. The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing. We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject. The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola. It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society. An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press. The European Union made a specific <span class="italic">démarche</span> on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year. We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola. We are also committed to the Security Council’s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.</p>
<p class="contents">While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola. An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society. The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO. The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere. This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them. Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally. This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before. There are alarming reports of human rights violations. Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika <span class="italic">démarche</span> on the eleventh of this month. We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky’s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights. We await a proper response from the Russians. In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today. And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes. I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon. We vigorously supported the Troika <span class="italic">démarche</span> to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year. The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders. At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties. I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days. I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.</p>
