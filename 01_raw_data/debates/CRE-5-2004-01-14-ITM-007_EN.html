<p class="contents">The services sector includes a wide range of services in the public and private sectors. It is the fastest growing and developing sector in the European economy. Over the last 20 years, around 2/3 of the growth in the gross domestic product of the European Union has come from the services sector, while the greatest increase in the employment rate has again been in this sector. Today, services account for approximately 69% of total employment. The aim of our policy must be to increase this percentage and it is worth mentioning that, in the United States, the corresponding figure is 80%. At the same time, we must pay attention to the fact that the situation in the development of the services sector differs from one Member State to another in the European Union. The countries with the most serious structural problems, such as Greece and Portugal, have the lowest employment rates in services. The rates are equally low, with the exception of Cyprus, in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy, at both European and national level, must play a significant role in the development of services. Successful regulation of the services markets is genuinely important for protecting consumer interests, ensuring quality and guaranteeing fair competition. There are still very inflexible regulations, however, which are stifling economic activity. As a matter of urgency, accurately targeted measures must be drawn up and implemented to guarantee a satisfactory level of protection in such a way that service providers and services themselves can establish themselves throughout Community territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, without modern, low-cost infrastructures, Europe cannot hope to meet the challenges in store for it, given the fact that international competitiveness in services is constantly increasing throughout the world. The completion of this infrastructure depends upon the liberalisation of the energy and telecommunications markets, so that we have easy and cheap access to them, and on the trans-European networks programme, in order to increase the potential of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the European Commission to publish a White Paper, proposing separate employment policies for each sector, so that we soon see the completion of a successful European market. The Committee also calls on the European Commission to propose a directive on services within the framework of the internal market, in order to deal with obstacles to the movement of workers and the provision of services. However, the Member States also need to restrict their bureaucratic procedures, both for the start-up and for the operation of services. </p>
<p class="contents">An appropriate framework of conditions needs to created, with regulatory and financial provisions and provisions on fair competition; new forms of employment in the services sector, such as part-time work, teleworking and temporary work, need to be strengthened; conditions need to be created for an appropriate, flexible and productive workforce that receives ongoing training; safe and healthy working conditions need to be created and undeclared work which, apart from debasing employment and workers, is a source of distortion of competition, needs to be combated. Investment is also needed in innovation in the services sector, because at the moment industry has the greatest interest in investment in innovation. We therefore need, both in the private sector and in the public sector, which is lagging well behind, to invest in innovation and research and to link our policy on services with policy to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises and the industrial sector in general, because industry and services are interdependent. We need to develop entrepreneurship in young people and promote self-employment, because the development of new activities in services calls for daring, imagination and innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Kratsa personally for her initiative in drafting this particular report, because it is a fact that the development of the services sector and combating the problem of unemployment, in other words job creation, are directly related.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Kratsa said, there is a close connection between the development of an economy and the percentage of employment in the services sector. If we bear in mind that we need to create 22 million jobs by 2010, in order to meet the Lisbon target, and that, on the basis of the information which we have, 67% of jobs are being created in services, we can understand how important the question of developing services is to attaining the objective of full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals contained in the report are in keeping to a large extent with the objectives of the European strategy on employment, as incorporated in the guidelines on employment in 2003, which were approved last July and which we have debated repeatedly both in the Committee on Employment and in Plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to certain issues in the guidelines which basically coincide with the proposals in the report. I would remind you that guideline 2 refers very specifically to entrepreneurship, to the link between creating jobs and entrepreneurship, and the Member States are called on to encourage innovation in entrepreneurship, the ability to invest and a favourable business environment for all businesses. Of course, there is a link between these individual sectors and adaptability, by which we mean how specific undertakings, how the public sector in question could change how it is organised, promote lifelong learning, promote the question of gender equality, so that it is easier to move from the manufacturing sector to the services sector. One important section of the proposals is therefore addressed in the guidelines on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">A second category of Commission initiatives and proposals concerns investment in human resources. We cannot develop services if we do not invest in human resources. Here we have Commission proposals on research, training, lifelong learning and the specific objectives set in the Member States in relation to their education systems, be they in connection with the first stages of children leaving school or support for families and social infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">The third important Commission initiative is that yesterday it approved a proposal for a directive on services within the framework of the internal market. This will give this sector additional dynamism, with beneficial results for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">So, taking account of these three sectors: first, the specific guidelines in the strategy on employment which essentially and to a large extent relate to the need to develop services; secondly, the need for investment in human resources and, thirdly, the directive on services within the framework of the internal market, I think that, on the part of the European Union, there is an important framework which could help the Member States to implement their individual national policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that it is also clear in the report by Mrs Kratsa that she is calling not for the creation of additional means, but for greater specialisation in the existing strategy on employment, to take account of the special characteristics of the services sector. I absolutely agree with her and, of course, this debate will also continue in the European Parliament for some time to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no sector of the economy which does not require services, including the private sector, or in which the services provided are not acquiring greater and greater interest. It is therefore correct that there must be mobilisation on a broader front for the prospects which are opening up with services and I should like to congratulate my honourable friend, Mrs Kratsa, for taking the initiative and drafting this report.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which did me the honour of appointing me to draft our opinion, I should like to refer to certain aspects which link the internal market with the development of the job market, especially the services market, and with policies against exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the future of the internal market and the essential benefit to consumers will depend on the degree to which cross-border trade develops. However, the cross-border provision of services is still failing to progress. Consequently, one of our first concerns is to remove the obstacles to the cross-border development of services, limit the problems which still exist in free movement and establishment and further facilitate the recognition of professional qualifications, without clinging to the shackles of the past which, unfortunately, numerous associations of the liberal professions still persist in doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to strengthen the cross-border provision of services, both with the direct provision of services to consumers and with business-to-business services, we need to look at strengthening e-commerce and, from that perspective, to promote and develop the new standards of consumption which produce services and, of course, guarantee consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Given, moreover, that the charter for small and medium-sized enterprises already constitutes an initiative in which we have invested a great many expectations, we need to look at the possibilities, either through funding or by guaranteeing the insurance rights and strengthening the initiative of young people who want to break into the services sector in the form of self-employment or by setting up small undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to remind you that the services sector is the sector <span class="italic">par excellence </span>for taking up people with disabilities and keeping elderly people as active members in the market. We also all know that a significant part of all services which are provided to a society are taken up by services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy on services of general economic interest to date has, according to the evaluations, brought about positive results. However, we do not have a complete picture of the exact impact it has had on the question of employment, which is why, in view also of today's motion on the Green Paper on services of general interest, the Commission should proceed to make a systematic inventory of the repercussions of the liberalisation of these services on employment, in conjunction of course with the degree to which the needs of society as a whole are served.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the report is an excellent opportunity for a renewed horizontal reading of the individual policies of the European Union, in light of their contribution to the development of services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sector is, in fact, a catalyst for job creation and, as such, must be given due attention. Consequently, if we wish to achieve the objectives set out at Lisbon, we must act and act swiftly. The situation of the various Member States as regards the services sector is extremely diverse: Portugal, for example, has enormous potential to create jobs in this field, especially intensive knowledge-based services to be supplied to businesses and other institutions, family support services and tourism and associated activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the crucial role of the services sector in improving the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy and in creating more and better jobs, Portugal has paid particular attention to this field in its national employment plan for the period 2003 to 2006. Even so, Portugal, together with Greece, has the European Union’s lowest employment rate in the services sector, as the rapporteur pointed out a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">A boost needs to be given, therefore, at Community level and hence our support for the rapporteur’s request for the Commission to draw up a White Paper on completing a successful European services market. The Member States have a crucial role to play in this matter, since it is they, together with the social partners, who must develop a clear and effective framework for the services sector. It also falls to the Member States to ensure that the appropriate policies are implemented and to invest in training and qualifications for the work force.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the administrative barriers obstructing the free movement of workers and the cross-border provision of services must be removed. Lastly, I wish to underline the need for the Commission and the Member States to promote an open method of coordination for national employment policies in the services sector, with the aim of exchanging information and best practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of those proposals may of course find greater support than others. As a whole, however, they will remain for me a major contribution to the matter at a time when a large number of people are hard hit by unemployment and when insecure jobs and contracts are proliferating.</p>
<p class="contents">For all that, to make things clear, after those personal congratulations, as spokesman for the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I have to express our reservations about the constant reference to competition, the market and its rules and also our disagreement with an over-strict application of the principle of mutual recognition in a sector that also covers public services and services of the social economy. Neither must it be forgotten, and I will be brief on this point today, that we do not consider the de-industrialisation of Europe to be inevitable, especially since, in terms of jobs, it is and will be increasingly difficult to compensate for the disappearance of industrial jobs by jobs in the service sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that and pointed it out, it is very important to note, as you did, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, the importance of this service sector, just as it is important to identify the potential and the conditions for job creation. It is even more necessary for us to say what the real needs for services are. It is obvious in the matter of care, for children and infants, for the disabled and the elderly. For these, the service sector is essential for maintaining full citizenship irrespective of age, physical condition or health.</p>
<p class="contents">But at this stage I want to say equally clearly that there is a need for legal, legislative or contractual controls in order to avoid abuses that result in precariousness such as exists in the US system. That is why we must upgrade the existing professions in the service sector in order to offer quality jobs with correct remuneration and working conditions. We must increase the quality of this new form of employment, part-time working as it happens, ensuring that the same high level of protection and job security is guaranteed to all workers and improving the working conditions of women. We must close the pay gap between men and women and the differences in the level of access to employment and job promotion. Finally, we must increase cooperation in the fight against undeclared work.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur and the members of our committees have worked well. And while, like the majority of my group, I do not think that the implementation of these measures will solve all the fundamental problems of work and employment, I am, Mr President, personally in favour of every form of improvement, provided those improvements are real. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her report has looked at both the possibilities and the challenges of the developing service sector. It is a highly complex area, not least because there is a divide between services that are geographically fixed, either owing to where the clientele is or where the resources are, and those that are far more moveable. One of the future challenges concerns the way in which those services do not necessarily move within one Member State or across borders, but indeed out of the European Union altogether. This type of mobility, which we might not have sought quite so anxiously, will be a future challenge for us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased about the attention paid to women in this report. As the rapporteur pointed out in the report, women are overwhelmingly employed in the service sector. Indeed certain jobs are very heavily gendered, particularly in the public and care services. Many of these sectors also have a significant number of migrant, black and ethnic minority workers, so they are important in terms of integration and social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the emphasis placed on the specific training needs required if we are going to provide quality employment. However, we need to look very carefully at how we avoid this huge divide that currently exists in the services sector between high value, highly-paid jobs and those which are poorly paid under intense cost pressure; how we allow people in those sectors to develop their talents and to find mobility is going to be extremely important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish at the same time to express my pleasure and satisfaction at the fact that Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, as rapporteur, and the committee as a whole have so kindly dealt with the many amendments I put forward. I would mention a number of them in this House, item by item.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, undeclared, or ‘black’, work must be converted into regular work within the service sector in order to improve the general business climate and taxpayer morale and to create competition under equal conditions. The EU must step up cooperation in combating ‘black’ work.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Parliament should call upon the Member States to develop and stimulate the support and household-related service sector in order to make it easier to combine working life and family life, especially in the light of the European Union’s having identified the demographic challenge as one of its most important issues for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Parliament should make the Member States aware that demographic developments in the majority of Member States are such that work in the area of care for the elderly should be accorded higher status, especially among young people. I want to emphasise that.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the European Parliament should emphasise to the Member States the urgent importance of increasing opportunities for disabled people and immigrants to have access to the labour market in the service sector. Such improvements are necessary in the light of future needs in, for example, the health and health care sectors, as well as in order to increase these groups’ participation and integration in the labour market and in the social community.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also emphasise the need for the report to signal the value of entrepreneurship and the spirit of new enterprise in the service sector, as well as the evolution of a dynamic and creatively developed cooperative service and business sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we were to analyse the changes in employment figures in the various economic sectors, we would soon see a rapid and significant reduction in the number of people carrying out their activities in the agricultural sector, a different trend towards job losses in the industrial sector and, in contrast, a clear positive increase in the numbers of people working in the services sector. Perhaps, amongst other things, as a result of the skill and the technical, professional and intellectual capacity of the people who carry out their activity in the services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the range of services is extremely broad, from transport to education, from commerce to hotels and catering, from tourism to leisure activities and, furthermore, the services are greatly affected by demographic changes in society. Activities relating to care of the elderly, or those stemming from the need to reconcile professional and family life are clear examples.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, this sector creates the conditions for the others, including agriculture and, also in the knowledge and information-based economy, the skill of the service provider generates new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to stress the possibilities arising from the whole, from cooperation between the different administrations, since local administration – the closest – has the best knowledge of the needs of potential job seekers and the means to satisfy them. Furthermore, I believe it appropriate to ‘horizontalise’ policies such as health and safety at work, equality for women and non-discrimination, as laid down in Articles 20 and 21 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must not forget ongoing training, since, as the rapporteur says, a services sector with low salaries means a low level of quality, qualifications and productivity, and that means a reduction in the economy’s capacity to generate innovation, sustainable wealth and social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
