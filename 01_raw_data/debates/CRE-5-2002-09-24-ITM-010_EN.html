In normal, run-of-the-mill circumstances when we have the budget debate, we have already voted on first readings in committee, we come to the Chamber and most of us make a three-minute speech if we are lucky or, if not, a one and a half minute speech. What is more, they are statements and nothing is really gained because the work has already been done.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are trying to gain from this session is a real dialogue, mainly with the Commission, but also with the Council, to seek guidance on how we should vote next week and to ask questions concerning events since the preliminary draft budget (PDB) was first presented. Since the PDB several things have happened, including the Council's vote on its draft budget which is what we vote upon. Our committees have been working with the rapporteurs to ensure that we can bring forward sensible amendments. As always, the amendments in front of us always exceed the amount of money that is available.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the job of both our rapporteurs to assess those amendments. No doubt during the debate you will be asked questions concerning what you think of some of those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the situation of a more precise legislative programme since the PDB and we need to assess the changes. We have had external events such as the floods and we want to know how these will affect next year's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">From our own perspective there are areas where we are unclear on how things will be funded. For instance, we still have no agreement with the Council or the Commission on how the EUR 27 million in Category 2 for the fisheries reconstruction programme will be found. Maybe someone will ask about that and if there are any ideas we will be grateful to hear them. A prime objective of the Development Committee is to ensure that the Global Health Fund has a significant amount of money. One of the reasons for this is that if we do not put in significant amounts the European Union may not have a seat at the table – a seat on the board. Is that true? What amounts do we need? I would hope that this issue will also be raised with the Commission so we can have guidance on it.</p>
<p class="contents">With those few opening remarks, let me thank not only the Commission in general but also the individual Commissioners who are going to contribute to this debate. I would also like to thank the President-in-Office for being here. I hope the debate will be useful, fruitful and influence our votes next week in committee, because if it does not we will all have wasted four hours of our time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We floated the idea as early as last spring, when we were extremely uncertain as to whether our efforts would come to anything. For us, it has been the overarching objective to try to reform the European Parliament’s budgetary work, especially with a view to next year’s completely new method of ‘Activity Based Budgeting’. In this context, it has been important also to be able to renew the debate itself, which is perhaps the most visible part of Parliament’s budgetary work.</p>
<p class="contents">This reform also means that we have endeavoured to increase the committees’ participation in the work. I have been round practically all the committees and discussed budget issues with them, and we are now also encouraging the committees to take an active part in today’s debate. By using working parties and different types of report to focus more sharply upon the degree of implementation and upon the major budgetary deficiencies we have in the area of implementation, we shall now tighten up our demands for Parliament’s budgetary decisions actually to be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I welcome the way in which the Commission, the Council, a majority of Commissioners and the Danish Finance Minister in his Presidency role have taken part in the debate, and I hope that Parliament’s own representatives will also make substantial efforts to ensure that we obtain a more exciting and constructive debate than has been provided by the fairly predictable monologues delivered up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s budgetary system suffers from serious defects, especially a lack of flexibility. I believe that both Parliament and, certainly, the public have difficulty understanding why it is completely impossible to find resources for the proactive part of agricultural policy known as rural development, while billions are allocated to the other dimension of agricultural policy. Knowing, as we did, that there were resources elsewhere that were not being used, it has also been difficult for us to refuse the administrative expenditure needed for enlargement and to try to find a way of funding this expenditure without making use of the flexibility instrument. Consequently, one of this year’s innovations is that we have tried more systematically to find and make use of unemployed resources and have contrived more systematically to bring expenditure forward in order to ease the pressure on a heavily burdened category over the next few years, something which might, for example, make it easier to meet the needs that exist prior to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a temporary solution. I really think we need a much more extensive budgetary reform. I also think we should address this issue in the Convention. The incredibly inflexible budget ceilings we live with at present should not be turned into permanent fixtures. They should definitely not be enshrined in the Treaty, and Parliament should self-evidently have the same right of co-decision in agricultural policy as we have in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Danish Presidency for its extremely sober and constructive approach so far. We reached some sound agreements in July, and we had a stimulating three-way meeting yesterday about how we might solve the problem of the floods.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to round off this introduction by appealing for the same constructive approach when it comes to solving the major outstanding problems, above all in category 4, concerned with external expenditure. We need much more flexibility. Parliament will protest at the fact that, without new resources being supplied, we are constantly adding new expenditure in relation, for example, to Afghanistan and the Global AIDS and Health Fund, over and above the contributions we have already made in relation to the Balkans, Kosovo, Serbia etc. That, I believe, will be one of the main points in Parliament’s criticism of both the Commission’s and the Council’s handling of the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenmarck (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the EU’s administrative budget has for a long time been one of the EU’s major budgetary problems. This year’s work is aimed at trying to find long-term solutions to these problems. At the beginning of the year, we were in a position to foresee a large budget deficit for 2003, indicated by all the estimates. Now that we have reduced this deficit and in actual fact anticipate a slight surplus for next year, we note that, in a long-term perspective, it is, in all likelihood, specifically 2003 that will be the big problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the European Council decision in Berlin in 1999, we have the opportunity of using the ‘flexibility instrument’ and in that way contributing extra funds. In its preliminary draft budget, the Commission proposed this arrangement for category 5. There were obviously reasons for this, not least the fact that time is short and that there is a huge amount to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to emphasise that there are now only two and a half months left before the final decision is made on which countries are to become new Member States. There are six months to go before it will be possible for 147 observers from future Member States to be present here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Only 15 months remain until the beginning of 2004. This is the year when everything changes and when the EU becomes an organisation quite different from the one it has been until now. It is the year when, hopefully, ten new Member States will have taken their places, the year when we take decisive steps towards the reunification of a Europe that has always been divided into East and West. It is a huge commitment, probably the biggest any of us will experience. It is therefore gratifying to note that by far the majority of the pieces of the budgetary puzzle are beginning to fall into place. Enlargement has the highest priority. The necessary reforms, especially here in Parliament, are in full swing, and it will be possible for them to take place within the set budget framework and within the time we have available to us. While the final countdown has begun and less and less time remains, there nonetheless remains a huge amount to be done, even where the budget prior to 2003 is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, there was of course a very great deal to be said for the Commission’s proposal for using the ‘flexibility instrument’. Nonetheless, Parliament and the Council chose to go against the Commission’s proposal. As a first step in the right direction, Parliament and the Council have agreed on the broad lines of the administrative budget. That is something which is completely new in the budget procedure but which is an advantage as the work continues.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment that Parliament and the Council have made and that other institutions must now make is to facilitate the Commission’s necessary investments and preparations. That must take place with an underlying appreciation and understanding of the fact that enlargement is not something with which <span class="italic">one</span> institution can cope successfully. Rather, it is a commitment on the part of all of us. Parliament has therefore tried to be especially creative with a view to making room for the required funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it is a question of trying to get as much as possible done in this year’s budget so as to be able to create as much scope as possible in the 2003 budget when enlargement is just one year ahead of us. It must then be possible for the room for manoeuvre we in that way obtain to form the basis for being able successfully to establish the necessary priorities for 2003. That is what we call frontloading. All – and I emphasise <span class="italic">all</span> – the institutions, including Parliament and the Council, have been encouraged to take an active part in this area. The reactions I have received have been positive so far. I am convinced that we shall succeed and so create the financial room for manoeuvre that the Commission in particular requires if enlargement is to succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that today’s debate will give Parliament and the Commission the opportunity to touch upon many important subjects relating to the 2003 budget. I again have the pleasure today of meeting Mr Wynn and the two rapporteurs for the 2003 budget, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck. I should like to begin by expressing my personal thanks for the constructive and focused dialogue on next year’s budget that has been conducted by Parliament and the Council to date. I also wish to take the opportunity of thanking the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, and the other Commissioners for their really helpful cooperation. There is no doubt that the EU’s 2003 budget is a major challenge. The EU is to take up quite a few new tasks next year. Allow me to mention just two. The EU institutions are to prepare themselves for enlargement, and the EU is to assume responsibility for the UN police force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Council, Parliament and the Commission are agreed that what is at issue here are political priorities to be adopted by the EU. For that reason, the budget procedure has until now also been characterised by a desire to find practical solutions and reach compromises. I am convinced that this fruitful cooperation can continue in the autumn, and I shall do everything in my power to help bring this about. I want to conclude by wishing the Members of the European Parliament, together with the Commissioners, a constructive debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, the 2003 budget is probably the last budget to apply to 15 Member States of the EU. We are, more or less, on the eve of enlargement. The budget year 2003 will, then, have further challenges in store not only for the candidate states, but also for all the European institutions that need to prepare themselves. These will be areas of major concern in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">But, of course, we also have other priorities in addition to these. I agree with all those who say that European politics must concentrate on stability and security. These are also reflected in the 2003 budget, in Commissioner Vitorino's budget for measures in the areas of internal affairs and justice policy or – and in many and varied ways – in the budget for foreign policy measures. Your House has tabled several motions relating to the security of our external representation, but of course also to all the aid given to Afghanistan. Aid, the increased funds for the Mediterranean, and of course pre-accession aid as well, are, in the final analysis, expenditure on Europe's enhanced political stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has decided on sustainable development as the third focus of its attention. This, too, touches on many specific budgets and programmes – the energy programme, the research programme, Mr Nielsen's programme or, to take another example, the rural development funds and the major Structural Funds for which my fellow Commissioners Mr Fischler and Mr Barnier are, respectively, responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, we will probably have much to say about the state of the accounts, and the implementation, of the Structural Funds – but not to the exclusion of other funds. The budget books for 2001 did indeed reveal a surplus of EUR 15 billion at year-end. Parliament has had the consolidated revenue and expenditure accounts since 1 May. That is a massive surplus, not a fictitious one as occurred in certain private firms' recent accounting scandals, but a real surplus. The Finance Ministers were very happy to enter this real surplus in their books, although Parliament took a rather more critical view of it. It is a fact that we must manage many programmes better in 2003. The Member States also have their part to play in this, and there is a need for good cooperation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission informs Parliament and the Council of the state of the accounts on a weekly basis. I might mention that this demonstrates an openness not shown by any Member State's government in its relations with Parliament. It goes without saying that such budget information is important in deciding on the best approach to the budget for the coming financial year. For it is evident that funds are short in any budget, even if it is a relatively large one. We have to face up to new challenges, for example when great and terrible catastrophes occur, in order to provide aid in a spirit of solidarity. A new instrument has now been created for this. I am very grateful for the speed with which agreement could be reached on the creation of such a new instrument. It really does give expression to the fact that Europe is a community of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, though, the new programmes require us to do a lot of restructuring and free up funds elsewhere. This should not be forgotten in today's debate, in which, no doubt, voice will be given to new desires and new proposals. We should also bear in mind the subsidiarity issue, on which subject I have to say that the Commission cannot work miracles; if political objectives are to become reality, and of course if expenditure programmes are to be implemented, it needs the staff to do it. I hope that Parliament will give its support to finding a solution to this question of the staff expenses for 2003. Let me express my gratitude to Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck for what they have just said, and for the motions that have already been submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">Development shows how much is expected of Europe, and how much from European politics, and we should live up to these expectations. I do think that today's debate will be an exciting and wholly innovative one, showing again that the European institutions are very much ready to innovate.</p>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/mepphoto/1419.jpg" align="right" width="50" height="63" onerror="this.onerror='';this.src='/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif'" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – My group welcomes this new procedure. It is rather an imaginative way of reshaping our political debate on the priorities for the budget for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">My particular role in introducing it today is to look at our strategy as a group, one which we have accumulated over the past couple of years. On this basis we have six particular points which we have put down as amendments which I wish to review briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first refers to how we handle outstanding budget commitments, which now amount to something around EUR 110 billion. In a joint declaration which we signed with the Council on 14 December 2000 we wanted to see these commitments reduced to normal levels by, if I remember correctly, December 2003. Therefore, the first of our amendments aims at getting clarification from the Commission as to exactly what its intentions are in trying to fulfil this commitment, how it is going to be done and how quickly it will be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in terms of Commission reform, which was also included in this joint declaration back in December 2000, we wanted to have a range of knowledge about how to achieve the reform. Some of us are in doubt about how far this reform has gone, how the rest of it is going to be achieved and when it will be implemented. That is the reason we have put the five hundred posts in reserve, which we wish to see released in stages as and when we receive information about the completion and the effectiveness of the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in relation to this there is the specific case concerning the Chief Accountant, where we have put a small amount of Commission travel expenses in reserve. We want to get to the bottom of the situation. We are seeking information and not the resignation of the Commission as some have rumoured. Therefore, we want Mrs Andreasen to come and tell us exactly what her allegations are. We also want to know exactly what the Commission's response to those allegations is.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we wish to deal with the Council in terms of foreign policy and security. This is because we have had amounts put in the budget for 2003, but before approving them we want to enhance the position of the other institutions – Parliament as well as the Commission – in knowing how policies will be implemented. We have an instinct that we do not like to see the Council spending large sums of money in managing foreign policy without proper accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we have consistently said as a Parliament that we do not want to see expenditure on Afghanistan made to the detriment of other spending priorities in category 4. We are therefore suggesting that the flexibility instrument could be used for this purpose as well as perhaps dealing with that commitment made in the 2002 budget to deal with the EUR 27 million on fleet restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have taken a slight departure from the norm and are recommending that the 220 Council posts are not approved until we have received a satisfactory explanation on a number of points which are listed in our amendment. These include the implementation of the early retirement scheme. We also need explanation, more particularly, on foreign policy so that we know what the projections are and how the Council thinks expenditure might be implemented over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying that this has nothing to do with revolution or our socialist leader, who says that these are undercover censure motions. This is about accountability and the proper functioning of democracy, where we as a Parliament are taking our responsibility in the budgetary process, using the reserve on a judicious basis to get the information that we need to be able to carry out our job effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me also, on behalf of my group, in this new sort of debate – not indeed the only one, as we will be having another in October on the substantive votes – set before you our position, our approach and our concerns. I wish to make reference to the great challenges before us, which have just been described. I have great confidence in the work of our two general rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, who have previously shown their capacity for excellent work. In managing the workload over the coming months and weeks, it is on their shoulders that we are standing.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest challenge is enlargement, which has already been referred to many times, and which marks a fundamental change in this European Union of ours. The European Union will, in two years' time, have an appearance quite different from any it has had before, which will not only have an effect on financial matters, but will also bring cultural changes in its wake. All this will need proper preparation. Here in Parliament, we will, whilst taking up our respective positions, have to show openness – freedom and openness to the acceptance of others, of new ideas and new impetus. This must also show itself in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have experienced in recent weeks, which started with a vast catastrophe striking Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, followed by other regions of the European Union, that we are inadequately prepared for the disasters that can afflict our continent. It is not enough to give assistance only in cases of emergency, although thank God this assistance will now be financially resourced in such a way that we are not only giving people the impression that we can help them, but are actually able to provide aid efficiently and effectively. No, it is not enough to help only when something has happened; we have to take preventive action. We have to work together on early warning systems, on research into environmental changes, in order to be able to prepare ourselves, rather than, like a rabbit fixated by a snake, waiting for the worst to happen, but getting to grips with it early on, in order to see what can be prevented right from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the issue of work creation. This continent still has too many people unemployed. Although this is one of the richest continents in the world, people are forced to remain unemployed even though we have vast amounts of money to use to counter unemployment. I speak, of course, with particular reference to the Structural Funds, but I also have others in mind. It must be possible to guarantee greater efficiency, and the faster and more efficient distribution of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed an efficiency force to shed light on all the bureaucratic apparatus, enabling us to act quicker and get money to where it is really needed so that people gasping for breath in the tangled bureaucratic undergrowth do not sink back in despair and say they can do no more.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to ensure that this EU of ours plans for the long term, with regard to staff expenses as much as to anything else. Thank God our staff are relatively young, but we have to finance all their pensions out of the budget. If we want to plan for the long term here, we have to make an early start on ensuring that funds are put by for this purpose so that we can give help in this area, or else we will run into major problems, at any rate further down the road. There are initiatives that have been in place since 1996, but which have not to date been implemented. That is something we have to get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">We must help small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union to have their share of economic development. Success in this European Union of ours must not be the preserve of the big firms that can afford their own legal departments and tax departments; it must be put within the reach of small enterprises and micro-businesses. We have submitted amendments on that subject. In these discussions, you will find us to be willing to work constructively with you. Other amendments have been tabled, but I wanted to set out the focal points of our approach. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents">European Union budgetary policy is overshadowed by the unsatisfactory way in which the budget itself has been implemented. As Mr Elles stated in his speech just now, a good EUR 15 billion in budget commitments remained unspent last year, which is an inconceivably huge amount of money. The Commission has suggested the blame lies with the Member States. We must ask what the Commission intends to do in the area of legislation to eliminate this defect in the system. I would similarly like to ask the Council what it intends to do to simplify the implementation of the Structural Funds, pre-accession aid and other long-term programmes, in order to avoid the build-up of such enormous outstanding sums in the future, and, indeed, reduce them.</p>
<p class="contents">The payment appropriations in next year’s budget stand at just 1.01% of GNP, which is to say EUR 5.9 billion below the financial perspectives. Such meagre sums will not help to reduce the arrears: they will, instead, pile up when the eastward enlargement of the EU has taken place and a lot of other problems lie ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports preparations for enlargement to the east. Next year is the last in which they can be carried out properly. For this reason, the administrative process must be reformed and made more flexible, so that human resources may be deployed more swiftly and appropriately than is the case at present. We support the reform of the Commission, but at the same time we insist on greater clarification in the areas of personal accountability and job descriptions. Moreover, we believe it is important that administrative accountability is also reflected in greater efficiency in such areas as making payments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is so huge that it cannot be seen. It is good that an attempt is being made to reduce the scale of the RAL problem. As a ‘sunset clause’ is being introduced to achieve this the Commission’s inefficiency might fade from view as a result. Today, however, that inefficiency is visible in the growth of RALs, as certain other groups have remarked here.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group agrees that enlargement should become the budget’s main area of focus. In that connection we must ensure that the European Union is able to function in all its official languages right from the outset. We call on the Commission to reject any proposals that state that some languages should be accorded a position that is inferior to others with regard to interpreting. If an interpreting facility cannot exist for all languages, let us draw lots to see which ones are not to enjoy that facility.</p>
<p class="contents">In July’s conciliation process the Council promised to produce a legal basis for the early retirement of twenty or thirty officials on temporary contracts employed by Parliament’s political groups. In exchange it obtained provisional budgetary unity. It got a very good deal.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of budgetary unity allows certain Member States to obtain financial aid from the EU in exchange for scrapping their fishing fleets. This has been agreed and we do not oppose it. However, losses cannot be overcompensated for, and, for that reason, many members of our group feel it is important that the new fisheries programme proposed by the Commission be approved. Nevertheless, there are forces at work to block it, in the same way as it is being reduced to what is just a new agricultural programme under the direction of a certain large Member State. Some of our group wish the Commission every success in its reform of the fisheries and agricultural programmes, and some do not.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinions differ in our group on the question of whether it is necessary to support European-wide political parties out of the EU budget. As there is no legal basis for supporting Europarties this way, we are proposing, as a technicality in the budget, that we should make a p.m. entry under the corresponding budget heading. It should not be proposed that money be given away when it is not legal to do so. I would like to say this to the President-in-Office of the Council: do please correct the regulations pertaining to the Members of the European Parliament so that a legal basis is achieved in respect of this issue too.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased, in the main, that the Commission has proposed reducing the amount spent on propaganda in the wake of the Prince programme. The Commission’s actions are evidently worse for the EU with propaganda than without it in terms of legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">We on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy were disappointed with the course of action the Council took when it made its funding decisions in respect of the Sixth Framework Programme for science and research. The programme was agreed upon without any formal settlement. We hope that the traditionally excellent spirit of cooperation that exists between Parliament and the Council can continue with regard to this issue also and that the Council will restore matters to what was originally agreed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has now requested 500 additional positions to guarantee the smooth running of the enlargement. In principle, I can understand this, for if 10 new countries join, this will result in more work. However, I do have a few questions in this respect. Is it correct that you are now requesting staff for the priority of enlargement, while the priority of sustainable development is systematically being managed with too few officials? If I understand the Commission 'Better Regulations' proposals correctly, the Commission even suggests passing the responsibility for notification mainly to the Member States from now on. Is this because you really believe that Member States are better placed to comply with environmental legislation and to monitor it, or are there simply budgetary reasons for this, namely that you do not have enough officials to check whether the Member States indeed comply with this legislation? If this is a budgetary issue, I do fear for the priority of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question concerns the 700 positions which we rubberstamped in previous years. Am I right in thinking that these have been distributed reasonably evenly across the entire Commission and have not really been clustered according to certain priorities? It would be regrettable if this were the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the enlargement and the EU budget. If I understand it correctly, six candidate countries risk receiving less funding from Brussels in 2004 than they did in 2003, and four countries are even at risk of becoming net contributors. It is fortunate that you are prepared to compensate for this, and it is, indeed, excellent, but the bill could still be higher than estimated in these candidate countries if their implementation of the Structural Funds is not as successful as you estimated.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it therefore possible – and this is a proposal on our part and I would appreciate a response – to see if these candidate countries could take their projects through the entire procedure as early as 2003? In other words, if they could complete all the administrative formalities, so that they can start immediately with the real construction work on 1 January 2004?</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make one final point. If this is also a debate on what Mr James Elles said in response to Mrs Andreasen, my group is also of the opinion that any problems in the accounting system must be closely examined after the Commission's and the Court of Auditors' hearing. We would possibly need to invite Mrs Andreassen at that point. It is up to us MEPs, though, to examine this. As for the link with the Commissioners' wages, it is really beyond me how the PPE has worked this out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 23 years – the first 10 in the Committee on Budgets – and I am from time to time a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I was involved in putting Parliament’s house in order following its scandalous dealings with taxpayers’ money which have left us with the still unfinished business surrounding the issue of reimbursed travel expenses. I have read the annual reports by the Court of Auditors. I was involved in dismissing the last Commission, and I have always been very critical of the lack of transparency in the Commission. Not by any stretch of the imagination did I, however, at any time think that the Commission did its accounts on an Excel spreadsheet so that the figures could be adjusted without anyone’s knowing. If the owner of an ice-cream stall or hardware shop were to do his accounts in the same way, it would be unlawful and lead to legal action by the tax office. In this case, we are talking about the Commission, but the legal action is being taken against the person who revealed the accounts scandal. There is a desire to shoot the messenger for bringing bad news. The Spanish Chief Accountant, Mrs Andreasen, deserves a lot of praise for having given Parliament the information we should have received from the Commission. Mrs Andreasen initially went through the internal channels and passed her observations up the line to Mr Prodi, but to no avail so far as I understand. The Commission wanted her to sign off an account that half the Directors-General had signed only with reservations. Since 1994, the Court of Auditors has refused to vouch for the correctness of the underlying transactions. For eight years, therefore, my web site, bonde.com, has contained a letter from an office in the Court of Auditors to the Commission, and it is the most alarming letter I have read in my 30 years in the EU. The Commission’s current practice of accounting on spreadsheets lends itself to poor administration and fraud. Against that unfortunate background, SOS Democracy wishes to invite all adherents of ordinary accounting to meet Mrs Andreasen on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in conference room R3.1. We should together discuss how we can deal with what, to me, looks like the worst scandal in the EU’s history. Now, we know a little about how matters stand. From now on, we all share the responsibility. Thank you, Mr President and Mr Pedersen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who suffered flood damage must now get aid very quickly and without red tape, and it goes without saying that provision must now also be made for the future. We must, though, take steps to deal with the constant increase in unemployment. SMEs continue to gasp under the excessive burden of taxes and levies placed upon them, whilst, at the same time, investment activity in Europe is declining, and the unemployment rate is, as already mentioned, constantly rising. The excessively high rate of unemployment among young people is a particular problem, and there is urgent need for special programmes to reduce it. I hope that Members of this House will support the motions we have tabled on this subject, which seek to promote apprenticeships in SMEs. Such action would strengthen SMEs and help those young people who, in Europe, have little or no chance of vocational training. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that these same problems are being repeated calls into question once again the reliability of the budgetary forecasts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 2003 budget, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism proposes increasing the maximum limit for payment appropriations, because in accordance with the amount corresponding this year to the multi-annual programming – EUR 27.5 billion – EUR 8.1 billion must be used for the RALs accumulated between 1994 and 1995, which is EUR 2.9 billion more than was forecast.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ask that account be taken of the difficulties which will arise during the next financial year as a result of the application of the N+2 clause. Great effort will be required in terms of cooperation and control between Parliament, the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the pre-accession structural instrument, the ISPA, we must take up the Commission’s proposal, which means increasing the appropriations for this programme during the 2003 financial year to EUR 1 117 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 750 million in payment appropriations. It makes very little sense, when enlargement is about to take place, to weaken a useful and, above all, necessary instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">In the budget we oppose the reduction in payment appropriations which the Council has made in relation to the Commission’s proposal on FEDER programmes and various Community initiatives. We must prevent them being insufficient to cover the commitments in the near future. It is better to anticipate these problems than to regret them at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that we are worried about the scant support, especially in the budget, we believe there is for transport safety systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I must express our concerns regarding the implementation of the budget for the European Social Fund. The Social Fund plays an important role, of course, in the development of poor regions and of the European Employment Strategy, and it will indeed also be very important in connection with the forthcoming enlargement. In this area too, moreover, we see the build-up of outstanding commitments, something which we regard as a problem. Now, Commissioner Barnier has just presented a communication on developments concerning the implementation of the Structural Funds, providing us with a number of explanations as to why larger outstanding commitments than expected are accumulating, and that is something for which we should thank the Commissioner. There are of course new rules and procedures for the 2000-2006 programming which are to be incorporated, and the Member States have apparently overestimated the ability to implement the projects in the first few years. What basis have we, however, for believing that things will be much better over the next few years, apart from the incentives contained in the ‘N+2’ rule (otherwise known as the ‘sunset clause’) according to which the money is lost if too long a period elapses before the payments are utilised? As MEPs, we constantly hear complaints that this is an unwieldy system. A good overdraft facility at the bank is needed if money from the Social Fund is to be received. It is the long time it takes to make the payments that is a problem, and one that the Commission must do something about. We are also told that the rules and procedures are too complicated, and it was agreed in July that Parliament and the Council should simplify matters in order to encourage utilisation of the funds. You too, Mr Barnier, have put simplification on the agenda. How quickly will it be possible, however, for the work on simplification to take effect? Will it have done so by 2003? What are the deadlines for this work? Thank you, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all, I would like to say to Mr Puerta and to Mrs Jensen that I very much appreciate, as do all my colleagues, their thanks for our work to provide an objective explanation, particularly by means of the communication on budgetary implementation that Mrs Schreyer has just presented to you. As you can imagine, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was out of a concern for transparency that I launched this new debate and it was out of the same concern that I appeared before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and before the Committee on Budgets. On 17 July, the Committee on Budgets clarified the situation regarding management.</p>
<p class="contents">In the communication, we strived – and Mrs Jensen has just touched upon this – to realistically identify the causes of the under-implementation for 2000-2001 and the risks for 2002, and to explain the measures taken to rectify the backlog. Simplification is another area on which we are about to set to work. I proposed to all the Ministers, in the presence of the chairs of the parliamentary committees concerned, to begin working on this issue on 7 October, and we provided a working document for immediate simplification within the framework of the Berlin regulation and by using or seeking out all the possible ways to enable simplification. I hope you will agree that making a policy even more simple after 2006 is a different matter altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, having carried out all this work to explain the situation, I do not agree with the term ‘negligence’ that Mr Seppänen used earlier. If there had been negligence on the part of the Commission regarding the RALs, the extent of which I recognise since I mentioned this, how can you explain the fact, Mr Seppänen, that the results are so different from one country to another? I said and I repeat that almost all of the RALs are a problem for four countries out of fifteen and I would hope that we expose where the responsibilities really lie. I would like you to avoid using unfair terms to describe the Commission’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the 2003 budget, I am certain that the ceiling of the financial perspectives will not be exceeded. I would therefore like to say to Mr Puerta, in an attempt to reassure him, that we did not believe it would now be necessary to go above this ceiling. The Member States’ requests will, without doubt, be higher than the appropriations provided by the Commission under the 2000-2006 Structural Funds, but we can learn lessons from the past. In our communication, we analysed the problems which arose and we are therefore taking a slightly more cautious approach. It is likely that we will be up to speed – with 27 to 30 billion payments per year – in 2004. Until then, we shall remain slightly below the 25 billion that is required.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a risk that the needs for 2003 will be higher for two lines. The first line is the completion of the 1994-1999 programmes. This year, the Member States are taking their time in forwarding their requests for final payment. It is likely therefore that we will have underspending in 2002 and an increased need in 2003, which should however be able to be covered by carrying sums over. The second line which may require additional appropriations is the Cohesion Fund. After two years of underspending in 2002 and 2001, the measures taken to speed up the programmes’ closure are bearing fruit. It is likely that more than 3 billion will be paid this year and if that is the case, the 2.5 billion that we requested in 2003 could turn out to be insufficient. My personal view is that, if Parliament wished to increase this allocation by 500 million, this would not present a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Virrankoski, Mrs Jensen herself and Mr Puerta mentioned the extremely strict rule that is known as N+2. It is true that this rule enforces discipline and good management. It was designed to do exactly that and was approved by Parliament. But it also creates a gap: N+2 leaves two years between commitment and payment. That is why the RALs are probably going to rise. It also takes two years of programming in order to reach EUR 60 billion. To be honest, when you see the quality of the projects concerned, the nature of this significant investment, two years of programming do not seem excessive. I think that the N+2 discipline is certainly preferable to carrying over all the cancellations at the end of the period, which is what we should have done as part of the previous programming for 1994-1999.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the points that I wanted to clarify, Mr President, at the beginning of this discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The worst thing that could happen would be for the contributions to lose support because they are not spent and that we should believe that our intended objectives do not correspond to the needs of those who have to spend them. In the face of this political failing, we can only act by saying that the innocent must not pay for the sins of the guilty and that not all of the Structural Funds are badly managed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Community initiatives, either Objectives 1 and 2 or the Cohesion Fund, have seen a higher degree of implementation. I am also pleased that the majority of countries do their duties properly, which demonstrates that the procedural measures are easy to comply with, although not all of the countries are as diligent in complying with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the fact that the Structural Funds are not being implemented as we would have liked does not mean that we must spend on other headings, but that we must seriously apply the N+2 commitment. It is obvious that if the countries or regions which have not fulfilled the N+2 clause see that the Funds are returned to them, they will have no incentive to change their attitude. The States and regions which do not use the N+2 must definitively lose their contributions, in favour of those other bodies, regions or States which are going to use them. Therefore, the figure for non-implementation is not serious; our aim must be for the responsibility for non-implementation to fall to those who have caused it. In this respect, I welcome Commissioner Barnier’s efforts to put things in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is a shared one, the solution is a shared one. The fact that we have EUR 100 billion of outstanding commitments should be a problem for all the Community's institutions. We cannot accept the premise that it is the sole responsibility of those Member States. We certainly want to see action by all the institutions, including the Commission, and this Parliament in particular, as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to transport, we want to see action quickly here too. In particular, we want to see a reinstatement of the cuts of EUR 1 million proposed by the Commission in overland transport safety. It is absurd to propose to cut accidents on the roads by 50% in 8 years and yet cut the budget in that key area.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want to see a reinstatement of the 20% reduction proposed by the Commission in sustainable mobility. Again we talk a lot about the environment, but the very programmes that will help protect and preserve it will be cut if the Commissioner has his way.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth and finally, I agree with the Commission on the need for more transparency. At the moment my committee, which takes its job seriously in trying to scrutinise the budget, simply does not have the facts at its disposal to make a proper quantitative, as well as qualitative assessment, of what is happening to the budgets for transport and the Structural Funds. I hope that after this debate we can work harder to make sure that we can demonstrate to the European taxpayer that value for money is being given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, regional differences have also grown. It is therefore very clear that regional aid will be needed in the future too, as Mr Puerta suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">Delays in structural policy were largely due in the early stages to the slow preparatory work undertaken by the Commission and the Member States. Now it is burdensome administration and complicated, rigid procedures that are causing the delays. These are also causing problems in countries that have kept to the timetable. The implementation thus far of both last year’s and this year’s budgets have led to a considerable increase in unpaid amounts of money. Our group is very worried about the possible negative impact that will have on next year’s budget and the Union’s structural policy both later on and in general. There should be compliance, however, with the N+2 rule, as it will help shore up implementation of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are compelled to ask, despite this communication and Mr Barnier’s fine words, what the Commission intends to do before this parliamentary term ends. What concrete measures are there, whereby practices associated with the Structural Funds can be clarified, simplified, and speeded up? This is a very tough question too because enlargement is just around the corner and we need to find remedies for these problems, with more in the way of results and less bureaucracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is not only in Germany that the goal of stabilising euroland by not exceeding a public debt of 3% of gross domestic product is in danger of being missed. The absence of 2%-3% annual economic growth means that grossly excessive unemployment figures can no longer be artificially covered up. This makes it all the more understandable that the backlog of Structural Funds is being treated as if the funds were not there. The prospect of actually successfully solving the problem of mass unemployment in the coming fourth quarter is made fainter by mounting indirect labour costs and the failure of the European Union, among others, to solve the problems caused by distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the days of public jubilation at the freedom apparently won through globalisation are over. The 2003 budget will instead be measured against the yardstick of seriousness, transparency and honesty. I can recall that Parliament was always more than merely critical of the annual accumulation of financial resources from the Structural Funds. What is decisive for the public's sense of belonging is what goes down well with them. The Commission's non-existent policy on non-existent Structural Funds does little to promote a feeling of belonging on the part of the European Union's citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The winter months are going to be the most difficult in economic terms for a long time. The many pledges made in the wake of the flood disaster must at last be worked off at a more rapid pace. If they are not, there is a growing danger of those aspects of land use for which we have already accorded financial assistance from the sources available triggering substantial conflicts between business, transport, housing, leisure and tourism at the various structural levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is grave, and I assume that it is known that the public are seeing the gap between income and expenditure narrowing still further. They need the money that is kept in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that the deficits are primarily the result of long drawn-out problems with approval, but also of the Member States' inability to really create proper programmes out of the reform measures contained in the last reform of the Structural Funds; this obliged the Commission to follow matters up any number of times. Both, then, are to blame. There is now the danger of big projects being supported because there is suddenly more money, and for that reason I warn the Commission against allowing that. There are indications that projects will again be supported without their being either efficient or sustainable, and I would ask the Commission to exercise its monitoring functions and ensure that sustainable development becomes a reality in the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What some people seem to be suggesting is completely unfair, namely that fraud would be involved in funding that goes unspent, for that is the problem with commitments outstanding. The problem lies in the very fact that it goes unspent, which is an entirely different issue. I also think that too much blame is being apportioned to the Commission and not enough to the Member States. I myself come from a Member State which is very much to blame for not spending the necessary resources properly and promptly, and I hope that this situation will improve in future. This is a good example, though.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the system is flawed on two counts. Firstly, we have a new fund each time, which means that each time, we lose a year. This is exactly what happened now and seems to be inevitable. I would ask the Commission to examine whether this can really be done in this way, for this is an inherent problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wonder whether we will ever be free of these commitments outstanding. Is it not possible, or conceivable, instead of simply leaving these, to conclude an agreement at a given point with a Member State that fails to manage to spend that money? We could, for example, say that we will channel this money back to the general resources, and this Member State will receive a reduction on their contribution, which has to be paid anyway. I think that this Member State could be very happy with this proposal, and indeed that everyone could be, as it allows money to become available for those who need it. Needless to say, this should be done on a voluntary basis; if not, the system would never work and Member States would never agree to it. Maybe, though, it is possible to solve this issue relatively quickly and pragmatically. I fear that it might be too pragmatic, for everyone likes to claim that funds should be spent, only to place many obstacles along the way should this then appear necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all the three lines dealing with social dialogue – B3-4002, B3-4003 and B3-4310. The last one deals with the Trade Union Technical Bureau for Health and Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking to increase the amounts on each of these lines, largely because of enlargement. It is very important that we get the basic building blocks of social dialogue in place in the applicant countries and we need to begin to channel resources in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to mention B3-4314. This concerns health and safety improvements in small- and medium-sized enterprises. We are looking to renew this line once again. I very much hope that following the work we have done on the new European Health and Safety strategy here in Parliament – a report will shortly be appearing in my own name – on a proposal from the Commission for a multi-annual programme for high levels of health and safety in SMEs. I hope that will come forward in the coming year and give us a permanent legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns B3-4106. This is a proposal for a new budget line in the names of Mr Howitt and Mr Andersson, although it was endorsed by the Committee on Employment as well. It seeks to give a solid base for support to social NGOs. It is very important that we do this to underpin civil dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would now like to add that it is no coincidence that many are in danger of losing part of their entitlement too. In other words, we risk suffering the blows of the stick without even tasting the carrot. We must take action but, Mr Bonde, we must make sure we do not set our sights on the wrong target. The European Commission is not the only one with responsibility in this area: a great deal of responsibility lies with the Member States too. We must make sure that we do not prescribe ourselves the wrong medicine. Personally, I am allergic to the reserves pill, which often does more harm than the original problem, and the idea that some political groups have of putting some of the Commissioners’ expenditure in reserve is downright ridiculous. The direction we must take is that of increasing payments and simplifying procedures. Commissioner Barnier has already told us what he intends to do and we are waiting for further clarification. Nevertheless, I would also like to hear what the Council has to say, if possible, and I call for greater attention to be paid to some of the Member States, who are sleeping the sleep of the unrighteous where this whole issue is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the speakers who have clearly understood what I meant earlier, particularly Mr Pittella who pointed out just now that the Member States have some responsibilities. But, to be very honest, Mr Watts must have misunderstood: the Commission is not shirking its responsibilities. I myself am greatly concerned, Mr Watts, by the underspending. I must simply reiterate that my work is based on estimates which are compiled by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some details that I must give to you, or confirm for you, which have been in evidence for three years, in other words, since I took up this position. For example, the Member States gave priority, at the beginning of this programming period, not to new programmes and to new projects, but to old programmes and to old projects which should have been completed. They therefore concentrated their efforts on winding up old programmes and they took longer to prepare the new programmes. This is one reason.</p>
<p class="contents">A new method of certification was also introduced, which caused some problems. We should also mention the new payment system. All sorts of rules were adopted in Berlin or after Berlin, which I am obliged to introduce. I would also add that many Member States – and Mrs Fiebiger mentioned the crisis and the lack of growth earlier – must cope with relative budgetary difficulties. I would point out that we are not funding the programmes 100%. There is an additionality rule whereby the Member States must provide part of the funding and some of them probably found it necessary to stretch their budgetary expenditure further.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the details that you will find in the report and the communication that Mrs Schreyer and myself have given you.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the RALs, once again, I think that it is usual to have approximately two years of programming since this is in line with the N+2 rule – so that makes about seven years of programming and two additional years in total. What would be unusual is for us to continue to support, through the RALs, very old programmes. That is why my work seeks, as a matter of priority, as I said to you at the beginning, to withdraw the RALs from the old programmes, which has almost been achieved. I would also warn you against drawing an assessment of the situation from one moment to the next. When you look at the RALs, at the beginning of the year for example, you do not gain an accurate picture because, although almost 99% of expenditure was committed in April, the payments can be made up to the end of the year. Therefore, at the beginning of the year, it looks as if the RALs are substantial. That is how the figure of 100 billion may have been arrived at. As I am speaking to you today, namely 24 September, the RALs for the old and new programmes amount to approximately 50 billion, which is an accurate reflection of these two years of programming.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter, whom I would like to thank, moreover, for the work that she has done – and I am thinking, in particular, of her excellent report on the second progress report on cohesion – emphasised the issue of sustainable development. Mrs Schroedter, rest assured that I am keeping a very close eye on ensuring that the Structural Funds are implemented as per the regulation and in accordance with European directives on the environment. For all sorts of political and personal reasons, I am working to ensure that the Member States, both present and future, use the Structural Funds in the appropriate manner, with respect for sustainable development. That is why for example, Mrs Schroedter, I decided to propose, with regard to the consequences of the floods, that, in the future regional policy that I shall submit to you at the end of 2003, whilst consolidating what we have already done under these programmes, the prevention of natural risks is virtually a compulsory priority in all the regional programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The N+2 rule is strict, but it is useful. Once again, as for natural disasters, I have placed the emphasis on prevention. Last November, I wrote to all the Prime Ministers, as did Mrs Schreyer. Since prevention still costs less than restoration, we hope that this will enable us to reduce the risk, Mr Pittella, of appropriations being wasted. At the end of the year, since it is the first meeting, the risks of wasting money under the N+2 rule will be very low. The risks will probably be higher next year, because, since the programmes were signed in 2001, the effects will be felt in 2003 under the N+2 rule.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the floods are concerned, Mrs Fiebeger, you urged us to act quickly. To be very honest – and many German and Austrian leaders pointed this out to us – rarely has the Commission reacted quite so quickly to current events. It took us less than four weeks to propose a flexible budgetary instrument, with Mrs Schreyer’s leadership. A few days later, I proposed the rules and arrangements for this fund to the Commission. The ball is in the European Parliament’s court. Last night, the Council held a trialogue meeting. I hope that we will be in a position, before the end of the year, before winter, in other words to grant the appropriations which are expected so that restoration, repair and even prevention work can begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the social dialogue, I listened carefully to the questions which have been put to us. They concern, in the main, Heading 3, and Mrs Schreyer or Mrs Diamantopolou will answer them later.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that, with regard to all these problems, and I am coming to my conclusion, Mr President, the Commission is not shirking its responsibilities. I am trying to favour transparency, to explain the truth and to be proactive in terms of transparency, as I have just said, as well as in terms of simplification, as this is the purpose of the meeting on 5 October with the ministers. I would also like to emphasise how the useful role played by the Structural Funds in improving governance on the ground, in the regions and in each country which is in need of them, including the oldest countries of the Union. In the area of partnerships, assessments, discipline and planning, the role they fulfil is that of a lever. I would like to convince you of their importance. The Structural Funds do not just represent money, they also represent real progress in terms of public administration, governance and, ultimately, democracy.</p>

<p class="contents">As already set out in the guidelines, we put the emphasis on such things as the management of borders, an area in which the ARGO programme is of fundamental importance, contributing as much to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice as it does to preparations for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement makes the topics of external border control, visas, asylum and immigration even more urgent. Efficient cooperation by the Member States and the candidate countries in these areas, and especially in combating illegal immigration, is indispensable, and requires that the necessary resources be made available for it. My Committee also supports efforts to integrate third-country nationals who are long-term residents here by establishing a pilot project. This would serve to transmit the values underpinning our coexistence in Europe. I am very glad that the Commission accepts this.</p>
<p class="contents">Security, freedom and justice are not, of course, to be had for free, but my Committee's present proposals do not represent any increase in the financial framework over against last year's budget. What we are asking for is only 99.4% of last year's figures. This is something I particularly want to underline, as we have greater responsibilities towards the EU's citizens in view of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by reminding you of the 21 September 2001 action plan to combat terrorism, which envisages joint action by all specialist units to prevent and combat terrorism, and requires that Europol and Eurojust be equipped for this purpose with special resources. It is with this in mind that I hope that my Committee will be backed up by Parliament's, the Commission's and the Council's own proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I will remind Parliament and the Commissioners, as culture spokesmen do every year, that perhaps we have not got our priorities quite right.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to the issue of information: this should be a shared responsibility between the institutions and the Member States. We wonder whether the Member States have got their responsibilities quite right in this respect. Earlier this year the Culture Committee visited Copenhagen, and we would like to pay particular tribute to the Danish Government and Danish Parliament for the information they give to their citizens about the working of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a responsibility to see that its citizens are well informed. Certain members of staff make great efforts in this respect, and we would also pay tribute to Commissioner Vitorino for the work and the vision that he is putting into this. However, we are not succeeding. The citizens of the European Union do not have enough information. We do not live in a neutral situation, we live in a situation where there is a great deal of disinformation and it is the responsibility of all concerned to see that is answered.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore make no apology when I point out that the proposed budget for information policy on the various B3 lines is less than EUR 100 milion or less than 37 cents per citizen per annum. That is a <span class="italic">very</span> small sum indeed. As I speak, I know that Euronews – the television channel that seeks to give objective information about all European issues – is itself suffering very serious financial difficulties. I hope the Commission and the budget rapporteur will look very closely at their pleas and make sure that Euronews is a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I will remind the House that the successful slogan for the Irish 'No' campagin was 'If you don't know, vote no.' We must see that the European citizens do not vote no, because they understand what the European Union is about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft budget as it relates to the areas for which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is responsible is for the most part acceptable. We are therefore proposing only a small number of changes to our opinion for submission to the Committee on Budgets. When it comes to the provision of information on the common currency, this ought as far as possible to be focused on those countries that are members of the EU but that have still not introduced the euro. The provision of information to the candidate countries should be financed via budget lines dedicated to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the budget line which relates to the EU’s industrial competitiveness and for which the Commission has proposed a twelve per cent increase in the appropriations, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes a change to the justification with a view to producing an assessment of the results generated by this budget line during the almost ten years of its existence. Since I personally have grave doubts as to whether measures of this type really give value for money, I believe that an assessment is something to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, I note that the Commission’s draft budget has included the change proposed last year by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs concerning access to venture capital. No change is required this year, then.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Council, unlike in previous years, has not proposed any cut-back in the appropriations for the development of the EU’s internal market. In this context, I want also to draw attention to the importance of having adequate resources for areas relating to the internal market, especially the implementation of the action plan for financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to emphasise that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believes that the amount introduced into Parliament’s own budget for studies and the provision of advice may be insufficient, given the expressed objective of using more external expertise in connection with complicated legislative matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the Parliament for its invitation to this debate today. I tend to interpret your invitation as the recognition of the political importance of the areas of Justice and Home Affairs and Information Policy, and definitely not of its budgetary importance, because comparing my budget with those of my colleagues, I feel like a beggar who is invited to a Christmas party in Wall Street. As far as budgetary issues are concerned, in order of presentation, I wish to thank the LIBE committee, Mr Ceyhun in particular, for the non-stop support this Commission has been given in establishing the area of freedom, security and justice. Once again, the LIBE Committee proposes the increase of the budget lines thought to be politically more important.</p>
<p class="contents">The PDB was prepared by the Commission based not only on political considerations, but also on the financial framework approved for each of the programmes, or on past experience in the running of the preparatory actions or pilot projects. Moreover, it presents a difficult balance between the human resources needed to ensure the correct management of the credits and those needed to ensure the creation of this area from a legal point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the proposed amounts represent a certain stability concerning the total amount, but with a re-centring of activities, a recast of the cooperation programmes, and an intensification of the actions in the area of asylum and immigration, including the external border control and the establishment of Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the very constructive opinion of the LIBE Committee, which brings into the PDB the major political developments which have occurred since its presentation – such as the conclusions of the European Council of Seville – which obviously could not have been considered at the time our PDB was presented. Nevertheless, I will make a plea for careful examination, bearing in mind such difficulties as human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the Cultural Committee, Mr Perry in particular, and also to the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee, particularly Mr Bergman. In terms of information and communication to the public in general, over the last few years we have seen great progress in cooperation between our institutions, in the provision of information to citizens, at political level between our relevant services and most importantly, on the ground, in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognising that the challenge of communication with 370 million citizens is immense, and the means available are definitely limited, we are now working increasingly with the Member States so that they share the responsibility for informing their citizens, engaging them in a dialogue that is a prerequisite for good governance and increased public support. The adoption by the Commission, in July, of the communication on an information and communication strategy for the European Union, and the warm welcome it received, both by the Culture Committee and the Interinstitutional Group on Information, provide tangible evidence of our shared political will to be proactive in generating awareness, combating ignorance and apathy and improving perceptions about the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to budgetary aspects, I must underline that, as in all other aspects of the budget, the Commission took a very realistic position in relation to information and communication. We recognised that, whilst informing and communicating with citizens must be a priority, we have to ensure that we have the capacity, especially in terms of human resources, to manage the expenditure of the funds. The PDB is therefore the firm basis for our consideration of amendments, with one exception that relates to the new priority topic proposed in the July communication mentioned above. I am referring to the role of Europe in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Interinstitutional Group on Information confirms this proposal at its meeting later today, we will suggest that an additional EUR 1.5 million should be committed for the PRINCE programme. This will be for a campaign which specifically relates to the role of Europe in the world and our actions to regulate globalisation so that it can bring benefits to our citizens and the wider world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the constructive opinions of the Culture Committee as well as the Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Constitutional Affairs Committee. At the meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information later today, we must reflect on the amounts proposed in the amendments and the practical implications. I will of course emphasise the need to ensure that we have the necessary human resources available to spend those amounts in an appropriate and proper way.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of expert assistance and the priority campaigns, we particularly welcome the specific proposal that the budget line for financing of PRINCE correspondents should also be increased. Without such an increase, we will not be able to engage Member States in developing the priority PRINCE campaigns. We also strongly support the amendment to restore a cut of EUR 500 000 made by the Council, in the line that provides for the use of information correspondents to work with the media in the Member States and for the use of Eurojust experts to answer citizens' questions relating to European law.</p>
<p class="contents">On the euro campaign, I must re-state what the Commission has already said in the past. The information to the candidate countries on the euro is included in the enlargement campaign, and the Commission believes that, in the case of the countries which are not yet part of the euro, the necessary funds will be proposed the day that each of these countries decides to join the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the new basis of cooperation between the Parliament and the Commission and engaging the Member States, we will be able to improve our information and communication policy and therefore make better use of taxpayers' money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is all well and good to affirm a priority, but this priority must also be followed up by concrete action. Yet, the appropriations for the area of freedom, security and justice are increased by less than the average level of increase for internal policies. Why is this, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that the PPE Group supports the amendments by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms proposed by the rapporteur in the crucial area of immigration and asylum policy. I would like to know if the Commission and the Council are prepared to support us in this direction. It is the first time that all the instruments of an active and balanced policy for managing migratory flows have been identified and strengthened by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms. We want to improve the ways of predicting migratory flows more accurately by providing increased subsidies for the European Migration Observatory. We want to improve control at external borders. We support the increase in resources for cooperation with third countries. We support the increase in appropriations designed to support integration efforts for immigrants who have settled legally in Europe and we also support the increase in resources set aside for the European Refugee Fund, although we regret that, in the draft budget and preliminary draft budget, these resources have been reduced in comparison to last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know if the Commission and the Council are prepared, in these matters that are strategic not only from a point of view of the development of the European Union, but also from the point of view of the way in which our fellow citizens perceive them, to increase the resources set aside in these different areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last question to put to the Commissioners and the Council. Last year, the European Parliament put aside EUR 5 million in the budget for use by Europol in combating terrorism. Why has the Commission waited nine months before proposing a legal basis? Is the Council prepared – yes or no – to accept this legal basis and to ensure that these appropriations can be used effectively? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The language of communication is also often cumbersome and not enough attention is paid to cultural differences.</p>
<p class="contents">However, now it would appear that there is hope for better things to come. In the plans drafted under the guidance of Commissioner Vitorino we can read of the aim to base communications on the public’s need for information. That is how it should be too. The Commission’s four priorities concerning information – enlargement, the future of the Union, establishing the area of freedom, security and justice, and the EU’s role in the world, are absolutely crucial. That is why it is unthinkable that the Council should make cuts in its own draft budget in the area of appropriations for the information service.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which supports Commissioner Vitorino’s information policy, has unanimously proposed there should be additional resources for the budget headings concerned with information. The social democrats in the Committee on Budgets adhere to the same policy. We cannot ask the people to become interested in our work if they do not know what is going on here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bonus that we should not carelessly fritter away. Great changes and challenges are ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial issues are evident – to us, but not to the European public. The man in the street in Vienna would say that there is something missing from our information policy. It is precisely on this area that a large number of amendments have been submitted. The pressure to inform is huge, and that information must be one-sided – glossy brochures, ivory-tower conferences and websites – no matter how inventive, brilliantly conceived and really informative. It reminds me of something I frequently experienced in my professional life. If the public don't come to the theatre, the theatre must go to the public. We have to go out to people, to universities, into schools, and the Member States cannot be discharged from their obligations in this respect. We are all open to that criticism. We should inform each other better, as the lack of information gives rise to misunderstandings, and it is precisely those that we have least need of.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me back to cultural policy. You always hear it said, in a cynical tone, that in Brussels there is money lying all over the streets, and you just have to pick some up. Well, when it comes to culture, you can't talk in terms of collecting money and certainly not of just picking it up – counting the pennies is more like it. Bureaucracy in this area is simply unmanageable. Although we have only limited competence in it, I wonder what became of the three institutions' will to do something about cultural policy. It is far too weak. Rather than promote European content in this globalised age in which we live, we are supporting the big boys – big countries, big co-productions. That way, the little guys, the smaller countries, and the lesser-used languages lose out.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to ask the Commission is this: a legal basis for the financing of the A-30 lines is being planned, but what conception does the Commission have of it? Is there to be a multi-annual plan? Is there to be an interinstitutional working party, in order that the criteria in the individual areas can be defined jointly and more exactly? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am, then, all the more astonished to note that, in the preliminary draft budget, the Commission is reducing the amounts for this over against last year and the years preceding it. What it boils down to is that this programme has an implementation rate of between 97% and 100%. The development of small and medium-sized enterprises is the cornerstone of the internal market, it being beyond dispute that this area accounts for over 90% of the workforce. It is an area that we must promote and develop, especially as regards new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission to support our motion that these amounts be augmented. I would like to use my remaining speaking time to call on the Council to at last come up with a ruling on the seats of the new agencies, so that this House does not end up getting through the legislative procedures in no time, with the Council then needing years to come to any decision on the seat issue.</p>

We were, in fact, extremely surprised to see the reductions which had been made to these lines, at a time when so many doubts are being harboured by European citizens who still do not seem to be receiving the right information.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to emphasise the fact that we tabled many amendments in order to give the Commission another chance to complete this essential task, namely the communication on the work of the European Union institutions. But I would also like to stress the fact that this communication must be, as Mrs Iivari said, targeted towards the ordinary citizen, the average citizen, who, when working or going to the market, does not understand what the European Union is doing for the future. We must undertake a thorough review of the strategy used by our institutions to communicate with the public. Let us go to meet the inhabitants of our fifteen countries and try to understand them. I believe that, as we did for economic measures, we must move from macrointervention towards closer intervention. As we do for SMEs, let us go and look for the citizens one by one! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as Europol is concerned, Parliament did indeed set aside 5 million in the 2002 budget. Yet, we came up against an issue that you are very familiar with, that of the legal basis, since Europol was set up by an intergovernmental convention, and the only funding available under this intergovernmental convention is that derived from Member States’ contributions. We began by asking Europol what it would do with this 5 million and, after some time, we finally received a response whereby Europol, realistically and pragmatically, told us that it wanted to use EUR 3 400 000 out of the 5 million in order, as part of the fight against terrorism, to create a database and improve the communication systems between the security forces and intelligence services. Based on this information, we prepared what we believe to be a legal basis which is currently being examined by the Council. I share your hope that the Council will find a solution to the issue of the legal basis so that the EUR 3 400 000 can be used before the end of the year. As for the amount of time that has passed in between, I shall now explain the reason for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned the issue of the 5 million to illustrate that I do not fully agree with your comparison of the figures. The 5 million was not proposed again this year. This amount has not been reproduced in this year’s budget. We must compare the JHA budget less the 5 million from 2002, in other words EUR 114 million, with the EUR 119 million that we want to propose. I understand that this may not seem very much to you, but I am speaking under the watchful eye of Mrs Schreyer, who will not allow me to agree with you.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the budget for asylum and immigration is concerned, I think that the budgetary line for cooperation with third countries was devoted, in 2002, mainly to aid operations for Afghan refugees and to the return of Afghan refugees. No one can question the priority given to Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">My intention for the future is to grant the appropriations from this budgetary line, for which no increase is planned, primarily to third countries which are currently negotiating or have recently been negotiating readmission agreements with us. This will allow us to finance measures to accompany the execution of readmission agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I support your idea that we should have at our disposal a general overview of the budgetary situation of funds that the European Union is already providing, at the current time, for cooperation with third countries in the area of asylum and immigration. These funds do not only appear in the JHA budget; they also appear, and to a great extent, in the Relex budget, in the Country strategy papers, in the regional programmes such as MEDA or CARDS. That is why the Seville Council asked us to draw up a report on the effectiveness of financial resources that we provide for cooperation with third countries. We shall do this within the timeframe laid down by the Seville European Council and I shall take this opportunity to present to you the first mid-term assessment of the use of the European Refugee Fund over the period 2000-2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the issue of enlargement that Mrs Sbarbati has just raised, I must tell you that 60% of all funding granted in recent years from the justice and home affairs budget to candidate countries has been used to improve controls at the external borders of the candidate countries and that the programmes concerned, which are part of the PHARE initiative, will continue until 2006. We have an assessment of the results of these programmes compared to the results obtained by the candidate countries each year. I can tell you that this is the number one priority as far as the candidate countries are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now move on from justice and home affairs and discuss information and communication. I can only support the idea that an information and communication policy must be a policy of proximity. That is why we proposed a new approach. I cannot promise you that the new approach will succeed. No one can. But I can assure you that the only solution is to form an interinstitutional partnership and work very closely with the Member States. If the Member States do not engage in an information and communication policy of proximity, we cannot do this from Brussels. In my view, this evidence cannot be contested.</p>
<p class="contents">You also know that the commitment from the Member States is totally voluntary. This means that the Commission and Parliament, in an interinstitutional framework, shall invite the Member States to become involved in this exercise, because we believe that, ultimately, it will be in everyone’s interest, not only the interest of the European institutions, but also of the Member States’ governments, to have a general public that is better informed of what is going on at European level. But, to do this, we must have the necessary human resources. That is why I called for the amounts which are included in the preliminary draft budget and which refer to the Prince and MEDIA correspondents working in the Member States’ capitals to be retained. Without these intruments, we will not be able to succeed in establishing this partnership with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you for your support in this respect and I hope that we will be able to develop, on the basis of this partnership, a more proactive, clearer and better targeted information and communication policy.</p>

<p class="contents">We have two problems here. On the one hand, our Committee's resources do not permit us to monitor and influence the debate to the extent that would be genuinely useful. On the other, we have many parliamentarians from other countries – primarily from developing countries – who cannot meet the costs, even for travel and accommodation, in order to attend these debates and play a role in this decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we want Europe to commit itself to playing a leading role in global affairs. The WTO and the capacity to make decisions on matters of WTO policy are extremely important, especially for our small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to press ahead with standardisation, because what we want to push for first and foremost, in terms of legislation, is mutual recognition, rather than harmonisation within the European internal market. In this context, standardisation is essential and fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in the energy field, we want to ensure that the intelligent energy programmes, but also the ALTENER, SAVE and SYNERGIE programmes, are used intensively and that the Commission sets priorities here, especially for our energy self-sufficiency, where the aim, after all, is to achieve an increase from 50% to 70%. In this context, more intensive measures need to be adopted as a matter of urgency to safeguard and secure our energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one further point, which originates from Parliament alone: we want Basle II to have its own action programme. We are concerned that the equity capital requirements for our SMEs will not be achievable by 2006, and that this will precipitate a massive number of foreclosures and bankruptcies. So let's do our homework here first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, the only real long-term solution to this problem lies in the revision of the financial perspective in 2006. I shall concentrate today on two issues where we can make a real difference this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the global health fund against AIDS, TB and malaria. The Committee on Development has proposed that all regional budget lines contribute to achieving the sizeable recurrent contribution needed. AIDS is a global problem. India is the country with the second-highest level of infection after South Africa, and the biggest increase in infections is in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Already the fund has committed 13% of its money to the Americas. But if the Commission and Council disagree with this approach, let them tell us where the money will come from. Let them admit that the EUR 35 million budgeted for does not achieve Mr Patten's own commitment made on 16 September in order to keep the Commission's own seat on the Global Health Fund board. This is right for Europe as a leader and innovator in the field, and it is right for the 3 million people dying of AIDS worldwide to make sure that the money works.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been given a clear understanding that the Global Health Fund's transitional working group meeting in Brussels agreed USD 100 million for a board seat, that the Global Fund secretariat has already budgeted for a USD 120 million European Community contribution for next year, and that approved projects will be cut if we fail to match that figure. I have given the Commissioner advance notice of these questions. If I am wrong, let him put this on the record today, and if I am right let him support our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the quality of aid. It is regrettable that agreements made since the reform of external assistance still mean that three times as much European aid is spent on transport as on health and education, combined, for the poorest people in greatest need. That is why Parliament this year is seeking to earmark this spending and promote it as part of the deconcentration of staff and in the new country strategy papers. Commissioner Nielson will be aware that on 15 July his services promised a firm proposal on this point and that I received his reply by fax only at 3.40 p.m. this afternoon after this debate had begun.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying that I hope the Commissioner will therefore defer the proper concerns he may wish to raise in relation to Parliament's proposals this afternoon, and commit himself to the further discussions where I agree with his wish, and I quote 'to press ahead together in achieving our common goals'. I look forward to hearing his response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee has set itself three objectives: firstly, to make clear which foreign policy priorities the European Union intends to set in the new financial year without wrecking the stipulated financial framework. Secondly, we want more transparency. A number of amendments to the budget's nomenclature are designed to increase the flow of resources. These proposed amendments also have no financial implications, but will lead to more budget transparency and thus facilitate budgetary control. The third issue, which is a particular priority for the draftsman of the opinion and the Committee, is to improve the security of our delegations around the world. Remedial action needs to be taken here and we want to support this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take each of these three points in turn. On the first point, we are planning some increases in funding to reflect political priorities for the cross-border programmes under TACIS. The European Union's new external borders require more funding for cooperation across these borders, which is why we have proposed a number of increases. The second issue is nuclear safety. This too is a priority for this House, and we want to see this reflected in the budget figures for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Anti-personnel mines and the rapid reaction mechanism are also areas where we have proposed budget increases. Then we have a scenario reminiscent of the film <span class="italic">Dinner for One</span> at New Year, with the ‘same procedure as every year’, when the Commission cuts the funding for human rights and democracy budget lines and the Parliament bumps it up again. We intend to do so this year as well, and we would ask the Commission to take note for once next year that Parliament is setting these priorities and that this should be reflected in the draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of transparency, we would like Afghanistan to be a separate budget line, not a sub-item under Asia. A great deal of money will flow to Afghanistan over the coming years, so this is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the draftsman has also urged us to ensure that there is, in future, regular disclosure of the budget lines for Palestine so that it can be ascertained from the outset where the money is going. In my view, better budgetary control is needed here. These are our priorities. Let me conclude by addressing a request to the Council. This House asks to be involved more closely in future when making new political promises in the foreign policy field. Otherwise, if the Council continues to make a succession of new promises without the money to back them up, we will forfeit our credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, in the foreign policy field, we face, after all, the most substantial new requirements for many years, without any scope to expand the budget. The Council and Parliament have already used the flexibility instrument several times here in order to meet the new requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Afghanistan, I would like to extend my thanks to the Council and especially, in advance, to this House for agreeing to the very rapid release at this time of EUR 70 million which are still in reserve for this year in order to provide assistance here, and especially also for granting the necessary direct subsidies to the transitional government.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue raised by Mr Howitt, which also relates to the Global Health Fund, I would point out that we have earmarked EUR 35 million for the Fund in the budget. After all, we have already contributed EUR 120 million to the Global Health Fund from the EU and EDF budgets. The decision was only taken recently, so we assume that these funds are adequate. My colleague Mr Nielson, in particular, has various budget lines available. He will make a statement on this issue shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Rübig's question on energy, the Commission has proposed a new multi-annual programme for action in the field of intelligent energies, which also provides funding for these energies in third states. I think the Johannesburg Summit made it very clear once again that we should be giving special priority to this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most Members of Parliament will recognise that, since we have discussed this again and again, it is not easy to say anything new. That is also the reason why Mr Howitt has not missed anything, even though I did not have the opportunity to reply to his last letter in time. That does not, of course, prevent us from continuing to discuss the matter amicably.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement last year on a 35% benchmark on health and education is an input indicator for our commitments to social infrastructure. The Commission will provide the breakdown of figures against the various DAC codes from the OECD showing commitments in 2002 and 2003 for health and education. The level of commitments will depend mainly on the results of the programming exercise in our partner countries. There is no need to re-open the agreement of last year, and there is nothing to be gained by it in terms of additional information.</p>
<p class="contents">The systems of tracing and categorising more clearly what we do is under implementation – according to what we have promised Parliament – and that will create a basis for a more enlightened discussion on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">On the funding of the Global Health Fund, as my colleague Mrs Schreyer has already said, the Commission will ensure that it will do what is expected. This is all we really need to say at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree very much with Mr Laschet that the increase in TACIS is important, inter alia for reasons of stepping up our presence in general in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">On what was said about involving Parliament more closely when making political promises, I understood that to mean that Parliament should be involved more before making political promises, otherwise I do not see why we need to discuss it. This is certainly a good and correct way of working and, in general, I feel this is the way things are being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Remarks were made about staffing and security in delegations. We welcome the amendment by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy underlining the difficult security situation of many of our delegations. However, the Development Committee amendment relating to the recruitment of specialists – the other point raised by Mr Howitt – puts very rigid and complicated conditions on the release of EUR 10 million of these funds. It would seriously undermine the deconcentration process, since we need to know the funds available in order to recruit and train staff. It will also unnecessarily penalise some of the poorest beneficiaries, since the main impact will fall on delegations in 30 ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do, and what we prefer to do, is to strengthen the handling of the different sectors by means of networks of specialists both in headquarters and out in delegations. However, a very rigid system, as proposed by the Development Committee's amendment, will not help us in getting things done in an efficient manner, so we do not welcome that proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One question we need answering before we take a decision next week on category 4 is: what is the amount of money that the European Union has to pay to get a seat on the board of the Global Health Fund?

If we look at what it took to get a seat in the first year, following the establishment of the Fund, the mathematics tell us that it was around EUR 84 million, but the United States says that it is paying for about four seats. We would not like to see a larger Health Fund board. That would not be efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Other actors are trying to get seats on that board, so there is some pressure. As you know, we came up with EUR 120 million for the first year. The actual use of that money and the overall availability of funds compared to the actual spending in the first year makes for a very open discussion as to the actual funding need for the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that the Commission finds it advisable not to come up with a figure today. We want to have a picture of what other donors are doing to make sure that we feed money into the fund in a prudent manner to make it work as expected, but also to maximise value for money whatever we do in this area as a whole. We do not have a figure right now. Also, we are not under pressure at this stage to clarify all the details of how we find the money, so we advise waiting a little.

Being able only to wait and see is not such a simple matter, at any rate for those of us in Parliament. Alongside the budget, we are working – as you know, Commissioner Nielson – on the directive that you are responsible for and that is to lay down the rate for the next four years, for which the Commission has proposed a total amount of EUR 300 million. According to the Committee on Development and Cooperation, this amount is altogether too little, not only for the purposes of obtaining the necessary flexibility and going in and supporting the Global AIDS and Health Fund, but also for ensuring that the EU’s own work, via the resources of our own secretariat, is as ambitious as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that both the Council and the Commission ought to welcome the fact that Parliament has this very ambitious attitude towards an issue and a problem that will dominate the discussions of development issues, not only in Africa but also in many other regions during the next few decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this issue, there are a further couple of factors that it is incredibly important to define when we discuss the part of the budget concerned with development cooperation. Mr Howitt has already mentioned focusing on health, education and efforts to combat poverty. I should like to say to Mr Nielson that one of the reasons why we are returning to these areas in order to clarify them is that the Commission’s work in the field indicates that it is specifically health care and education that still receive an extremely small proportion of the aid, something we regard as being manifestly wrong and clearly not good enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is incredibly important that we be more flexible within the European Union and ensure that needs that arise in connection with war and disasters are not constantly financed from long-term development programmes upon which they correspondingly place a burden. That is why the proposal to fund aid to Afghanistan using the flexibility reserve is extremely interesting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the G8 recently reached agreement on the need to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy in developing countries. Mrs Schreyer referred to this (to the intelligent energy programme) earlier. My question to Mrs Schreyer is: Would she say that EUR 19 million over four years is adequate for preparatory work in over 80 – 90 countries?</p>
<p class="contents">My question to Mr Nielson is: It is recognised that energy is a factor in poverty for the developing countries, so could he tell us how he proposes to coordinate his work with other DGs to tackle this?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that Commission Patten has made statements that the EU should have a poverty focus in its development aid. Therefore, would you agree that it is inconsistent to increase funding, as foreign affairs amendments have done, to Latin America and MEDA lines, and actually take away money from Asia lines? What do you think of Mr. Elles' statement today that Afghanistan should be funded from the flexibility instrument?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to return to the Global Health Fund. I am not really satisfied with the response and the answer we have had from Commissioner Nielson. What I want to know, with regard to the EUR 35 million that we are proposing, is whether that is enough to get us a seat on the board? Is that adequate in terms of the EU leading the debate and fighting AIDS in the world?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the Council their opinion on the U-turn in the PPE position, and the proposal to break the gentleman's agreement. In the July conciliation, the PPE agreed to the Council's budget, but this afternoon we were informed by Mr Elles that they will put EUR 6.3 million from their basics budget in the reserve. They are breaking their word, and if this amendment is accepted, what would the Council's response be?</p>

This is mostly the case, but not always when the so-called special delegates are involved. For example, the EU has one such delegate for the Middle East. Parliament has repeatedly said that it would be desirable to have such a special delegate for the Southern Caucasus or Tibet, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now facing the problem that the coffers are technically empty for this purpose, for these special delegates fall within the scope of the Council's budget. This is not to our liking, but the agreement is that we are not to touch the Council's budget. It now therefore looks like a widely shared political aspiration is set to wind up in the cogs of Parliament's budget machinery. I should like to draw both the Council's and Commission's attention to this, with the very specific question to the Council whether it would be prepared to make room in its budget for a special deputy for the Southern Caucasus and Tibet and if not, to make this known promptly and clearly so that the Commission can plug this hole. My question to the Commission is whether it is prepared to do that. After all, it is unacceptable for European presence in crisis regions to be restricted simply because a widely shared political aspiration is at risk of falling between all the financial stools. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite apart from improper tasks, it appears that the Commission is hardly able to handle real Community policy. Just think of the gigantic discrepancies between commitments and payments. In the area of external actions, we come across quite a few unprofitable proposals that have sprung up from the Commission's inflated ego. This is true, for example, of the EU's position between Israel and the Palestinians. The capital that flows to the Palestinian Authorities largely ends up in unknown pockets. We will therefore endorse the PPE-DE's amendment to place at least a proportion of this capital in reserve, as long as the Palestinian Authority lacks an efficient control system.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who want to place the budget for the Sixth Framework Programme in reserve too. The report by the committee on human genetics foundered last year due to the great division in this Parliament concerning an ethical framework for biomedical developments. This is why I consider it utterly despicable that a number of fellow MEPs from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy should put pressure on the Council to break through ethical boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about research into embryonic stem cells no less, which affects human life in its earliest form. Fortunately, a number of Member States are enforcing the ban on the use of human embryos for research. It would create a bizarre situation if we were to finance this kind of research from the Sixth Framework Programme. Research that is punishable in one Member State would then receive funding from the European Union in another. I truly hope that the Council does not get blackmailed, but shows respect for human life in its earliest form.</p>
<p class="contents">The aforementioned fellow MEPs who have negotiated with the Council on behalf of Parliament in this manner have gone beyond the boundaries of political decency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a highly important chapter in which our credibility is at stake, not only with regard to the aspects already cited by my fellow Members – the RAL, occasional implementation problems – but also in terms of our public statements, our political and legal commitments, and important budget-related actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In his absence, I am addressing my comments to Commissioner Patten in particular, through the intermediary of Mrs Schreyer. I am talking about the cooperation agreements we have concluded with many countries. For a number of years, thanks to Parliament, these agreements have all contained what is called the ‘human rights’ clause. This clause is so important that it should be read and kept in mind. This clause states that the agreements shall in practice be suspended or considered suspended should the two parties fail to respect human rights as guaranteed by international conventions, and in particular the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Well, despite the fact that Parliament has insisted on this aspect, despite the fact that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, including cooperation agreements, made a commitment to ensure that these agreements are respected to the letter, we still, as if nothing had happened, continue to conclude and maintain projects, programmes and funding in countries run by dictators. Take Vietnam, for example. Together with my colleagues in the radical party and hundreds, or even thousands, of people, and also many of my fellow Members, I called the Commission’s attention to the human rights situation in Vietnam. Well, in 2003 we are due to give Vietnam EUR 38 million. We have tabled an amendment so that, at least at first reading, these agreements and funds may be set aside until the situation is resolved and both Vietnam and the Commission provide us with guarantees and explanations as to what is really going on there. There are other countries in a similar situation. We took Vietnam as an example because we think the Commission should really change its method of managing and implementing the budget with regard to these cooperation agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, my group and I want future border areas to receive more attention. That could be done, for example, by strengthening cross-border cooperation under the TACIS programme. If that is not done there will be tension, and a good example of that is Kaliningrad. It is not just a matter of the region’s isolation: the social and economic differences between it and its neighbours are enormous. For this more money is needed right away.</p>
<p class="contents">Another good example is the Northern Dimension. We must vigorously support it, and, for that reason, my group has proposed an extra EUR 10 million for cross-border cooperation under the TACIS programme. This has had the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A third example is nuclear safety. For that we are proposing EUR 25 million. We all understand why.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question for the Commission. Implementation of action under TACIS has produced some very poor results. You must agree that it will be an important project for years to come. Could you say how you intend to improve the situation and describe to us the development strategy the Commission has for transboundary cooperation?</p>
<p class="contents">I then have a question for the Council. It is not acceptable that from one year to the next the European Union undertakes new commitments under Section IV of the budget, without putting more money into it. That weakens the credibility of our foreign policy. Can you give us your opinion on this? If the Council makes promises with regard to every crisis without considering the financial implications, we will reach a dead end. What is your solution? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome this for reasons of visibility, but suggest that in return, so to speak, East Timor be reintegrated into the ECHO budget line so that the overall number of budget lines does not increase.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of the Global Health Fund, which has again played a major role in this debate, I should point out that of the pledges made by the various donors, almost two-thirds come from Europe, in other words, from the European Union and from the Member States direct. This is a high proportion. The proposal we made in the budget plan – and we really gave this matter very careful thought – to include 35 million in the budget line at this stage is, in our view, adequate. However, we also said that if it is not enough to keep our seat, we will have to see what measures need to be taken. So far, there has been no sign from the other donors to suggest that this figure is inadequate at the present time. Nonetheless, it should be stated clearly once again that securing the seat on the board was a major priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn briefly to Mr Lagendijk's question regarding the Special Envoy. This is indeed an issue which concerns the budget for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. As you know, the Commission has already proposed increasing the funding by one-third, specifically to finance the shared costs of the International Police Task Force in Bosnia. However, we appeal very strongly for adequate funding for measures from the rapid reaction mechanism to be included once again in the Commission's budget plan. The Council had cut this area, and we would welcome it if Parliament could restore the funding here.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the issue of TACIS. In view of the fact that in category 4, i.e. foreign policy, we only have a very small margin available overall, we must decide whether there will be further cuts here. However, I would also like to appeal for us, as part of the enlargement process in 2004, to focus particularly on ways of boosting cross-border cooperation with our new neighbours in the East post-enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a brief word on the implementation of the budget. I should point out that for this year too, we have achieved a higher rate of implementation in category 4 than was the case last year. The numerous measures adopted by my colleagues Mr Nielson and Mr Patten at administrative level, namely the adoption of new structures to facilitate more rapid implementation, are genuinely having an impact on the budget figures. I think this shows that the reform efforts are proving very successful and the assistance is reaching its target more quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we took office at the end of 1999 the overall time it would take to work our way through the existing commitments at the level and the pace of spending at that time was 4.5 years. The following year this figure was down to 4.1 years and at the end of last year we were down to 3.66 years. This is a rough, primitive but correct measure showing that we are in fact reducing the gap between the decisions on commitment and the actual implementation in terms of spending per year. We are moving in the right direction but I have not been silent in trying to clarify to this Parliament what kind of a problem we had, the size of that problem and the complexity of it when we took office.</p>
<p class="contents">I normally characterise our foreign relations and development cooperation work by saying that it is nice that the Commission is big. We do have a critical mass but when we look at the legacy of the past it is also true that we have a critical mess. We are changing this gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures mentioned by Mr Wijkman in this ongoing discussion on how much we do on health and education, the money devoted specifically to the Global Health Fund, is of course not the whole story. We are also discussing the totality of the money being spent and I need to come back to this figure of 35% as the target expenditure on the social sectors, which we agreed to with Parliament and which I still think is something we can deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of the flexibility instrument for Afghanistan has already been addressed by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer. We should normalise our development cooperation and support to Afghanistan. The best solution would be to put it into the budget as a whole. Still, money is needed regardless of the source, and we need to more or less mop up resources to do what needs to be done in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The figure quoted by Mrs Gill on renewable energy only regards a special initiative. The total figure for what we do in the field of energy also, especially with regard to renewable energy in development cooperation, is much bigger.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that in Johannesburg we launched the energy initiative together with the Member States. We have backed this up by the information that, in total, Member States and the Commission have an annual level of spending for energy-related development activities of about EUR 0.7 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with deep satisfaction that Mrs Gill quoted my colleague, Mr Patten, on the need to focus on poverty in what we do in this whole area. I could not agree more.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Global Health Fund, I can tell you that the 15 EU Member States have pledged a total of 64% of all the pledges made in support of this fund. We must also take this into account when taking the final decision on how much we consider adequate from the Commission for each year as we move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Dell'Alba, I would say that the aspect of human rights and the inclusion of clauses referring to human rights matters is a standard element. If you look at the whole new generation of country strategy papers that guides what we do and creates the basis for it, country by country for the whole world – this not only applies to the ACP countries but also to Asia and Latin America, etc. – these papers clearly give a strong, prominent role to the issues of governance, democratisation and human rights. We do not yet have the same kind of mechanisms as those embedded in the Cotonou Agreement, where we have a negotiated relationship, but this whole discussion is clearly an important element in the ongoing dialogue with all our partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to Mr Paasilinna, on how to improve the TACIS programme. In the light of the experience of Afghanistan over the last year, we are determined to step up the focus on this group of countries for reasons of conflict prevention, but certainly also because of a stronger sense of a closer neighbourly relationship with these countries. All this is emerging, and we have long spoken about the need for redefining and updating the character of our development cooperation with these countries. I feel confident that we will see increased activity, and I hope stronger financial activity. As has already been mentioned, an increase of 5.4%, giving a level of EUR 502 million, now makes this group of countries a main partner, including from a financial perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the equal opportunities budget itself, it is important in my view that the money intended for initiatives to promote women's equal opportunities – initiatives taken by the NGOs – should indeed be able to be allocated in a simple manner. The conditions now prescribed by the Commission are far too tough and far too difficult. For example, it stipulates that the initiative should be tabled by five countries, and also that it must have a very high budget. This is not feasible for quite a number of women's organisations. Hence the suggestion to admit initiatives if they involve three countries, where the budget can also be a little more restricted. I insist that this change should be made so that the budget can be used more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of crucial importance to us is gender policy. This should not remain confined to the equal opportunities budget; it should be present in all of the Community's areas of policy. I would draw your attention to one point in particular, namely the conditions for cooperation with the developing countries at a political, economic and cultural level.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Nielson said a moment ago that the conditions for cooperation in the field of human rights with the ACP countries, Asia and Latin America, are very stringent. Nevertheless, I notice that when human rights are discussed, this does not always include women's rights. This is why we absolutely insist – and this is for us in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, and I believe also for all the women in Parliament a real must – that cooperation with countries be suspended if they fail to take measures to prevent violence against women, stoning, public chastisement, genital mutilation, cremation or rape. We would therefore ask for aid to be abandoned in those cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Bösch has tabled a number of amendments from the point of view of a critical friend, regarding OLAF, the Anti-Fraud Office. We are now beginning to see the problems of the office not being completely independent of the Commission. Accordingly, Mr Bösch's amendments which have been adopted by the committee include questioning the mission expenses of OLAF, questioning their information and communication measures – having received a reasonable amount of money for this purpose, the office put out less than twelve press releases in both 2000 and 2001 – and indeed questioning both the Commission and OLAF over a cut. The PDB actually cut the budget for OLAF by a substantial figure and we had no answers as to why that money had been cut. The committee has reinstated the money cut, but has put this money into the reserve pending the answers from both those institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has also taken a strong view on export refunds. There are many experts on export refunds on the committee. I am definitely not one of those, but essentially the amendments aim for transparency and to help people like me understand the purpose, scope, cost and implementation of export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments include those on the Economic and Social Committee, cutting funds to reduce its dependence on external experts, increasing appropriations for the measures to combat counterfeiting of the euro – something I as a British Conservative have some trepidation in suggesting – and reinstating part of a cut in budget line B1-361 which seeks to improve monitoring and preventative measures in candidate countries concerning agriculture budgets.

Because we are a polyglot, multilingual union, there must be speedy, clear and accurate translation of the courts' judgments into all the languages of the European Union in order that citizens and their legal advisers throughout the European Union are up-to-date on the law of this Union and how it is properly interpreted.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not reinstate the estimates that the Court of Justice itself made, we will fail more and more often. There are very specific points: we need <span class="italic">referendaires </span>in the Court of First Instance because the European Union has failed to fill vacancies for judges, we need upgraded posts and we need improved translation services.

<p class="contents">The first aspect concerns the Prince programme. This was Parliament’s main priority, which we quite rightly imposed on the Commission. I believe this programme proved its worth in the assessment and popularisation of a number of our priorities, European priorities: the euro and other subjects have subsequently been addressed. This year, the programme has been drastically reduced by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, which is baffling considering that 2003 is the year in which the work of the Convention will end and that this great joint work will need to be given all the publicity and importance it deserves. We have therefore asked for substantial funding to popularise the work of the Convention, while giving those who are against this Convention or its results the opportunity to make themselves heard – which theoretically speaking is not my case. I am speaking out like this because I believe this programme to be important.</p>
<p class="contents">The other aspect concerns the Internet. We have <span class="italic">Europe by Satellite</span>, our citizens already have some means of access to our work, debates and press conferences. The Committee on Institutional Affairs is proposing to make the Internet a proper tool that enables citizens to say: ‘Let’s see what they’re going to say at the Commission briefing this lunchtime; let’s see what the Court of Justice judgement will be today’, etc. This programme must therefore ensure that soon, in time, the Internet becomes an important vehicle for publicising the work of all the institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know this is a national event, but all of us are members or one party or another at home. Sometimes this provides fresh impetus and then it should benefit everyone. Of course, the framework to be set in the budget for the Committee on Petitions is relatively small. Nonetheless, this framework is still quite important. After all, we had more than 2100 cases last year, which the Ombudsman had to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard this still relatively new institution as a major step forward in guaranteeing the quality and control of the administration and citizens' access to it. We therefore fail to understand why our few requests relating to the coming year's budget, which primarily concern staffing, have obviously fallen foul of the restrictions and tight constraints governing administrative expenditure. Indeed, I have the impression that in the past, the Commission pegged future costs for the administration at an extremely low level, far too low, and that we are now having to live with the consequences of this mistake. Ultimately, it is down to us, as Parliament, to allocate the scarce resources as fairly as possible. I think this situation is open to severe criticism. Our colleagues have presented their cases for their areas – the small institutions – and I hope that in future budget procedures, despite the error that arose at the advent of this financial perspective, we will be able to find a solution in our area as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is after all a separate plan, and one which must, of course, be managed within the constraints of category 5 if new requirements exist. In response to Mr MacCormick's urgent call for more posts at the European Court of Justice, let me say that the category 5 ceiling applies here too, and I would point out again that you mentioned this in connection with enlargement as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement, according to the financial perspective and according to Agenda 2000, we will have more resources available in category 5. Our joint task at that time will be to allocate these resources appropriately. This means that with enlargement, these restrictions will ease to some extent, taking account of the fact that in a European Union with 25 Member States, many new posts will be needed in Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Justice and, not least, the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the questions and comments made by Mrs Smet, I fully endorse her view that women's policy and equal opportunities policy must flow into all policy areas. This is not simply a voluntary statement, although I make it quite voluntarily. It is a binding commitment under the Treaty, and one that is taken into account quite explicitly in many policy areas. On the issue of human rights violations, especially violence against women, let me point out that Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement also reaffirms that the equality of men and women is an integral element of human rights. Of course, this is also a guideline for all measures in the area of category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Heaton-Harris's question on the OLAF budget, and why the Commission has introduced a cut in the PDB of around EUR 700 000 compared with 2002, this is actually a technical adjustment. In 2002, Parliament amended the establishment plan, compared with the Commission's proposal, resulting in more ‘B’ posts instead of ‘A’ posts. Naturally, ‘B’ posts cost less than ‘A’ posts. This was not accounted for in 2002, but it has been accounted for in the preliminary draft for the year 2003. In other words, this is not a cut but an adjustment, although I would point out to the President-in-Office that during its first reading, the Council has now introduced a real cut which will have to be discussed. Let me add that in our call for additional posts in preparation for enlargement – posts which are not yet secure, although I greatly appreciate Parliament's efforts in this area – additional posts are envisaged for OLAF as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, Mr Heaton-Harris, I will refer your questions on export refunds to my colleague Mr Fischler later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For years, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has put forward proposals during the budget procedure to take account of the different impacts of our decisions on women and men. We have been successful in the field of employment policy and the Structural Funds, where gender mainstreaming is now enshrined as a principle. In foreign policy, too, gender sensitivity is increasing. In the context of aid to Afghanistan, targeted measures have thus been introduced to reintegrate women into public life and restore their human rights. We have achieved successes in combating trafficking in human beings, which is a modern form of slavery. Violence against women has also become an issue in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the STOP and DAPHNE programmes must not be used simply to carry out representative events. Ultimately, just 13% of the projects can be funded, which is why the NGOs must be given direct assistance. Gender budgeting must become even more of a theme than is currently the case. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is working on an own-initiative report on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A word of criticism on the practice governing the allocation of funds as well: all too often – for example, in town twinning or the NGOs – it generates a great deal of resentment. There is much frustration among active Europeans. If on the one hand, we ensure that we do not spend any more on tobacco cultivation and we dismantle bureaucratic hurdles in this area, we cannot then put up similar hurdles in the way of the NGOs. I ask for your support.</p>

Employment is an important issue. Unemployment is on the increase in the EU. It is in small and medium-sized enterprises in particular that jobs are created. Unfortunately, fear of distorting competition often hinders even rational action. For that reason, competition law should be interpreted more freely in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises. This would mean, for example, that the Structural Funds could be used more effectively to prevent unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension is a major premise in the political field. The Commission has mainly focused on two issues: environmental protection and nuclear safety. We would like to extend this list. The Northern Dimension offers immense potential in the area of energy policy. The natural gas deposits in the Arctic Ocean will be of vital importance to the EU in the future. We should just ensure that the links that are to be built should, as far as possible, pass through EU territory. The Northern Dimension also offers immense scope for cooperation in the field of cultural and research policy and higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR is strongly in favour of reforming the Commission’s administration and pruning bureaucracy. The importance of that was reflected in the debate on the Structural Funds. Administrative costs should be in reasonable proportion to the operating appropriations used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My other question in this area, and also my concern, relates to small projects, to which Mrs Smet has already referred. Everyone will agree that tax money must be spent wisely. It is true that the evaluation of small projects requires a relatively great deal of manpower for relatively small amounts of money. However, these projects are often important, for example, for society in the developing countries. This is why I am hoping for a proposal from the Commission for such things as the transfer of more operational powers to the external offices, less bureaucracy, less stringent requirements and, for example, for parliamentary delegations to have political control over the choice of those projects.

The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is very concerned about the fact that at the European Court of Justice, there continues to be a massive backlog of translation work.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this mean in practice? Let's assume that in a specific case, proceedings have ended and a judgment has been handed down. As the Court of Justice – unlike other Community institutions – does not publish its decisions until they are available in all the Community languages, the backlog of translations means that the finished judgments stay in a drawer at the ECJ for between one and two years until they can be published. This is an untenable situation, in my view. It is also increasingly viewed as a problem by the national courts in the Member States, since in the case of preliminary rulings, the proceedings in the European Court of Justice are merely interim proceedings in the successive stages of appeal through the national courts. This means that these two years do not complete the proceedings; these two years are in addition to the duration of proceedings in the Member State. We therefore call for adequate resources to be made available in order to bring this untenable situation to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is also responsible for issues relating to the internal market and enlargement. We have always focussed particularly on the specific challenges facing the internal market as a result of enlargement, especially for border regions. We therefore fully endorse the amendments which aim to ensure that in line with last year's pledge, the funding for the pilot programme for SMEs is pegged at EUR 15 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In May, my criticism of the Commission was based on two considerations: the level of RALs and heading 5. In July, Parliament and the Council came to an agreement on heading 5 which rejects the Commission’s request for more staff to deal with the challenges of enlargement in an attempt to balance the accounts. I would rather not return to the subject of the RALs because time is lacking and because none of us wishes to hear information which we know to be completely unviable financially but which, nevertheless, is produced year after year in the budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at the risk of repeating myself, I have to say once again that all this is quite ridiculous. Here I am yet again, calling upon this House and, through this House, upon the Council and the Commission to give due consideration to the possibility of revising the financial perspective, which, on the basis of my relatively little experience, appears to be the only conceivable sensible and responsible political move we can make. Article 19 of the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement states clearly that the financial perspective can be revised on the proposal of the Commission in the event of unforeseen circumstances, and what could have been less foreseeable than the impending enlargement of the Union to include 25 Member States in 2004? I must stress: over the next three years, up until 2006, we will have to establish the budget for a 25-Member-State Union according to a financial perspective calculated on the basis of the needs of a 21-Member-State Union. Ladies and gentlemen, where is the sense in all this? Why are we continuing along this absurd path?</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal is, therefore, as follows. After the December Council, which will have to establish which and how many States are to enter the European Union in time for the European elections in 2004, the Commission should present a proposal for revision of the financial perspective, a proposal which the two arms of the budgetary authority will have ample time to adopt – in accordance with Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement – before the start of the 2004 budgetary procedure. I feel that this is the only path we can take, the only path which, with due regard for budgetary rigour, will allow us to continue to do our job properly. I do not feel that the solutions hitherto adopted have yielded sufficiently positive results<span class="bold">,</span> and whereas, thus far, we have only had to explain them to citizens who are, at heart, well-disposed towards us, whereas, thus far, we have only had to uphold them before voters who are, paradoxically, almost more European than we are, in a few months we will have to explain them to people who have suffered just to be part of this Union and who will view us with an extremely critical, vigilant eye, with even closer scrutiny than the current Member States, to see whether or not we have done a good job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we do need now is for the Council to fulfil its promise to offer Parliament a negotiation procedure in which Parliament can also help to define what the legal basis must be and the ways in which this fund will be financed in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">But, above all, we are taking part in this debate to thank the Commission for the initiative it has taken with this budgetary debate, which completely changes the structure we had in other years.</p>
<p class="contents">Our parliamentary group considers it essential – it has believed this for some years – to make the legislative and budgetary procedures more appropriate. This is not just a whim of this group but rather, since we are part of the budgetary authority, the European Parliament must be able to express its opinion on the resources necessary for the Commission to be able to move its annual political strategy forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The stock-taking for this year shows us that the concerns of the Commission are very clear and very specific and that the Commission, in particular, is very concerned that the new posts should be dedicated to the implementation of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the European Parliament is going to be sensitive to the concerns of the Commission, we want the Commission to be sensitive to the point of view of this Parliament in relation to the reform of the Commission. For us this is a political need, especially since we believed the promises of reform made by Mr Prodi and his Commissioners and, therefore, we have great hopes for this reform. The Commission will largely be judged on its ability to recognise the need for the reform, to draw up the reform and, above all, to carry it out.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to demonstrate that the European Parliament is inflexible on this point, we are presenting some amendments which put certain appropriations in reserve. We would be delighted and very happy, like every year, to be able to withdraw them on second reading, provided that the Commission has satisfied Parliament’s demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, after the Treaty of Nice the direction the institutions of the European Union are going to take is clear and in this respect you must take very good account of the fact that, from a budgetary point of view, this Parliament is only really a Parliament if it is given the powers to obtain complete information, complete transparency and full participation in all the Union’s financial decisions. Until this is fully achieved – and it has not so far been achieved – we are going to have an unstable and imperfect institutional model with many tensions and we are going to spend a large part of the budgetary procedure arguing about trivial procedural issues instead of the fundamental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is therefore presenting amendments this year which are aimed exclusively at improving the budgetary mechanism and the institutional balance which we believe to be essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some items in this proposal, however, are somewhat confusing, and I should like the Commissioner to clarify them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, why did the Commission decide to extend the coverage of this type of disaster in its proposal, to disasters of an environmental and technological nature?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Structural Fund must under no circumstances be confused with this solidarity fund. This makes it hard to see on what basis the Structural Funds fall under this regulation. Would a general rule that cautioned against the dual use of the solidarity fund with measures already funded by any other instrument not suffice?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the reference to absolute costs of disasters makes no sense, because this of course most benefits the large economies and, furthermore, it is hard to understand why no reference is made to the financial capacity of each State as a criterion for the aid to be granted by the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly and most crucially, we fail to understand why the regulation gives no consideration to a clear typology for the situation of outermost regions that have been most badly affected by natural disasters and I would ask the Commissioner how they can, in fact, be covered by this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferber (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me quickly run through just a few points regarding the 2003 budget procedure. Topic number one – since it occupied our minds yet again this week, as the President-in-Office can testify – is the European Union's aid to ameliorate the damage caused by the catastrophic floods in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This House agreed what was really quite a good strategy a few weeks ago. Sadly, we have been unable to push this through in the negotiations with the Council. However, I have a specific request to the President-in-Office: please ensure that all the pledges you made to us yesterday in the trialogue, especially as regards the timetable, are upheld in practice. After all, the emergency assistance which we are seeking to provide will lose its impact if – due to your failure to keep your promises – we cannot pay out the money until Christmas. This would be unfair to the people and the victims of these floods.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE group's other idea has already been presented to you by the chairman of our working party, James Elles. I shall pick out just a few of the points here. Commissioner, I recall very clearly that at the start of its term in office, the Commission made various promises about all the things it wanted to do better, especially its plans to reform and improve the Commission's functions and working methods. Three years down the line, it is clear that this reforming zeal has now subsided somewhat. This being the case, it is down to Parliament to provide something of an incentive and motivate you to keep up the pace of reform. We therefore say ‘yes’ to additional posts, but initially in the reserve, and we expect a detailed timetable to be presented, showing how you intend to use your remaining two years in office to complete the reform of the Commission. This was what you promised three years ago, and alongside all the other matters which must be dealt with during your term in office, you must carry this through, for it was a key element of the mandate given to us by citizens at the 1999 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of the trans-European networks – to turn to my second topic – we would particularly like to ensure that the bottlenecks with the Central and Eastern European countries are removed. I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to devise proposals for the Member States which are directly affected as countries bordering the candidate countries, so that the resources from the budget lines can be used specifically to remove these bottlenecks. I think it is very important for enlargement to take place on a real and practical basis by establishing an appropriate cross-border infrastructure with the Central and Eastern European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Topic number three: let me briefly address the issue of the Palestinian Authority. We have tabled an amendment which states that funds should be put on reserve here. We want to ensure that European taxes are used in a proper manner. As yet, the International Monetary Fund has been unable to confirm that in terms of control of expenditure, it is doing all that we expect to be done as a matter of course when European funds are being used.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a key priority area for us is the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The President-in-Office is already aware of my request. It is rather depressing to hold a conciliation procedure at the end of July while everyone else was on holiday, only to find that the Council then fails to honour the agreements we made. I find this very disappointing. My request is that as set out in the statement adopted during the conciliation procedure, there will be ‘appropriate involvement of the Parliament in respect of such matters under the CFSP’. We have tabled an amendment which is designed to point a way forward here, and I ask for your support. From next week, we will have to discuss in detail what we want to do during the 2003 budget procedure. The PPE is prepared to engage in constructive cooperation with the other groups. I hope that we will then be successful, through our joint efforts, in achieving progress on these important issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr MacCormick has already made some general comments and I do not think I need to insist on the importance of this institution. However, there are two issues that concern us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, that enlargement is scheduled for 1 January 2004, with it will come appeals and the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance must be prepared. To wait for the 2004 budget to cover these needs would seem to me irresponsible, since the Court must be prepared at least a year before the date on which enlargement takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that concerns us is that of lawyer-linguists. The Court constantly needs to translate texts, submit them, publish them and make them known in the different Community languages. It is not the fault of the Court that the European Union has decided to have such an excessive number of working languages. If these lawyer-linguists are not professionalised in the manner proposed by the Court of Justice, we will find that both the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice will be faced with enormous difficulties in terms of retaining this kind of staff. Professonalisation is therefore necessary at the moment, since without it we will have no guarantee that the Court will have the necessary staff to carry out its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As rapporteur dealing with the implementation of the 2002 budget, I would like to return briefly to the subject of the RALs. I listened to what Commissioner Barnier said to us but we must not disregard the fact that, quite apart from the seasonal factor, which might account for the current exceptionally high level, which will, we hope, fall as much as possible within the space of a few months, we have EUR 15 billion more than we had this time last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of this huge stack of unimplemented<span class="bold"> </span>payments must be addressed. I have seen the document, the communication sent to us by Commissioner Schreyer and Commissioner Barnier – for which I thank them – and I am afraid that it may well be a little too optimistic. I feel that this subject requires specific attention because, looking at the matter objectively, we are blocking a set of resources when, really, what is absolutely essential is a spring-cleaning<span class="bold"> </span>operation which might shed light on the matter, especially where commitments made many, many years ago are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitments which have not been implemented must be cancelled, expenditure must be reprogrammed and the barriers removed. This may well be the most important point, for we are talking about simplifying procedures – and we have discussed this in the context of the resources to be earmarked for natural disasters too: it really is extremely difficult for our citizens, our businesses and our public administrations to use Community resources.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner Barnier mentioned what I believe to be an extremely valid consideration, and that is the responsibility of the Council and the Member States’ governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by thanking the Minister, the Council representative, for his amenable contribution to the meetings of recent months. I fervently hope that this favourable climate will remain throughout the short-term future as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Volume IV, Section III – I have great understanding for Commissioners who have to deal in billions – we find budget heading A-3021: grants for European study groups and organisations advancing the idea of Europe. What a daft idea! Why? Because, I believe, it is symptomatic of the processes which result in many European citizens assuming that you have to have a friend who has a friend in order to get money out of Brussels. One of the previous speakers said that people think that the streets of Brussels are paved with cash.</p>
<p class="contents">People who genuinely try it know that this is not the case, but that, if you do know the friend of a friend, you are getting close. Budget heading A-3021 bears ample witness to this. It lists some organisations but not others. An amendment by us, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which was intended to guarantee transparency by ensuring that the Commission applies the guidelines on assistance and subsidies and safeguards equal treatment of applicants and organisations, has been rejected. That is a tragedy. I wish this situation could be changed, for there can be no democracy without transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To date, half of the Council does not accept the Commission’s proposals on the future CAP nor has there been any clarification of the funding of the reform of the fisheries policy whatsoever. In the conciliation in July some problems were cleared up, but some very important issues were left open.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, this Parliament – and my group in particular – has maintained that there is a need for a reform of the Commission which is in line with the ambitions of the European citizens of the twenty-first century. It has done so and will do so not through speeches, but through committed decisions and, therefore, in previous years it has provided the Commission with the posts it had requested.</p>
<p class="contents">For next year new posts have been requested for the purposes of preparing for enlargement, which is an objective which nobody calls into question. But it is also a legitimate and unquestionable objective to have precise information on the real progress made and data which confirms that we have a more efficient and transparent administration which is more guaranteed to be able to confront the future challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties in the funding of external actions, covered by heading 4, have become standard during every budgetary procedure. I am not going to talk about figures, but I want fundamental principles to be respected. Firstly, that throughout this period we maintain the principle of geographical balance in the annual allocation of resources and respect the political priorities of this Parliament. Secondly, that the Council abandon this pernicious double-speak of making commitments in word without adding new resources. And, thirdly, that the Commission provide regulatory instruments which guarantee genuine equality in the conditions for implementing expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the shared concern to solve the problem of the outstanding commitments, essentially the abnormal RALs, I would like to ask a question: does the Commissioner believe that the cut by the Council of EUR 500 million in payment appropriations is compatible with its execution objectives for next year? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall start with the questions and statements from Mrs Gröner regarding the perusal of the budget. She asked how many measures are targeted directly at women and to what extent programmes include specific equality-oriented elements. Let me point out once again that we have taken this into account explicitly in many of the budget figures and included it explicitly in many of the programmes. You referred to ‘gender budgeting’ and I would like to take this up. Indeed, my plan for the future is that we will also use our own very precise rules, which we have established for the accounting process, to provide further answers here. It is the case, of course, that payments can only be made to a beneficiary if he or she is recorded in the appropriate register. Up to now, we still have no record of gender, but this is a step that should be taken. I hope that on International Women's Day next year, I will be able to report on progress here!</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the issue of staffing and personnel expenditure, which was just raised by Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Escobar. Firstly, with regard to Mrs Buitenweg's question concerning the proposed use of the additional posts for the year 2003, I can say that this is correct. These 500 posts that we have applied for are to be allocated entirely to preparations for enlargement. However, there are to be personnel increases for the other priorities too – such as sustainable development and security – and this should take place through reallocation of staff in-house, within and between the services. In line with the Commission's proposal, this means that we can then ensure, through administrative measures, that 149 posts can be made available additionally for the ‘sustainable development’ priority. For the area of environmental protection, together with the posts for enlargement, the proposal now provides for 33 more places for the Directorate-General. I think this shows very clearly, yet again, where the priorities are being set.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the use of the 717 posts which you approved for us in the last two years, the focus here has been on foreign policy. Almost 300 posts have been created in this area in order to improve implementation of the external assistance programmes. From the figures on implementation which are circulated to you each week, you can see that real and substantive improvements have been made here, with the 300 posts in this area having a clear impact. This is also apparent in other areas, such as competition etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to Mr Virrankoski – and the appeal to improve the situation of SMEs came from several Members of this House – as follows: we have earmarked EUR 66 million specifically for this budget line, but SMEs can of course also secure funding via the Structural Funds and via loan programmes for which assistance is provided from various budget lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Würmeling, you called for appropriate resources for the European Court of Justice and drew specific attention to the fact that the European Court has to work in many different languages and that its judgments must also be translated into the relevant languages. There has been a strong increase in resources for the Court in recent years, thanks to the efforts of Mr Ferber, the rapporteur for this area, who has lobbied hard and very successfully for an increase in funding in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Turchi, you stated, in the context of enlargement, that there must be an adjustment of the financial perspective. This will indeed be our joint task for 2004 since the adjustment of the perspective must then be shaped in such as way as to ensure that we distribute the resources from category 8 appropriately to the other measures. After all, the negotiations on the enlargement budget are now well under way. The budget authority must then undertake the appropriate adjustment for the year 2004, so we will all be looking at this issue during the course of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo once again for his comments on personnel. With regard to the reform of the Commission, we will of course be very pleased to submit a report to you again on progress made with regard to the implementation of the various measures agreed in the White Paper and which are supported by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office will doubtless make a statement on the disaster fund in a moment. However, I should like to reiterate that we are in an unusual situation here because the task is to create a completely new instrument. If we do succeed in establishing all the legal bases for this new instrument by the end of this October, this really will be a record performance.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have answered Mr Medina Ortega's questions in connection with the European Court of Justice. As regards the implementation of the various measures, I think we should also discuss the report on the Structural Funds in more detail in the Committee on Budgets. I would just point out that in 2002, we will not have the surplus which we had in 2001, since far more resources are being used in the area of agricultural policy than was the case last year, and also because my colleague Mr Fischler responded very quickly by adopting the measures necessary to provide prompt assistance to the regions where farmers suffered losses as a result of the floods, or to other areas. The EUR 900 million to be used for this mean that the budget surplus here will be lower. It will be lower in the structural policy field, and we will also be using part of the surplus to finance the disaster relief fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Casaca, you and other speakers this evening have raised this issue, and the President-in-Office will underline this once more in a moment: in the debate about the legal basis – in other words, when do we refer to a disaster, when will assistance be provided, and what conditions will apply – the President-in-Office has agreed that there will be a conciliation procedure in due course here too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one further point to be mentioned: Mr Martin, you called for the subsidies to institutions which promote the European idea to be distributed in a different way so that there is no earmarking here. All I can say is that this is a decision for the European Parliament. The Commission has put forward a different proposal here. We will also have to decide on a legal basis, but in this respect, I interpret your appeal as a call to your colleagues in this House.</p>

<p class="contents">I was astounded to read a letter in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> yesterday, from Hervé Gaymond, the French Agriculture Minister, and six other agriculture ministers. It was entitled ‘The CAP is something to be proud of’. I was one of 400 000 countryside marchers in London on Sunday who would not agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidies have not delivered prosperity and security for British farmers; in fact, often subsidies and quotas are being capitalised into the high cost base of our industry. The letter reminded me of a drug addict in denial, addicted to subsidies. Rather than trying to kick the habit, they want to offer pills to the Eastern European countries waiting outside the school gates to get them hooked too. The CAP needs reform before enlargement, in particular, we should stop the hypocrisy of subsidising tobacco to the tune of over EUR 1 billion per year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee has also asked for 50% of the budget for the European Food Safety Authority to be put into the reserve. I hope this will be recognised by the Council as a clear signal that they should end the uncertainty about its location, which is making it so difficult for this embryonic institution to recruit staff and develop as an effective agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any event, we must now guarantee the use of a flexibility instrument for the EUR 27 million that will be used to fund the specific measure of promoting the reconversion of the ships and fishermen that until 1999 depended on the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco, covered by the heading on the structural measures of the financial perspectives under heading B2-200 of the draft budget for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion of 11 September on the budget for 2003, the Committee on Fisheries declared itself in favour of protecting the use of flexibility instrument for the PTE 27 billion for this funding, but as to the proposal to use the EUR 32 million for the funding of additional measures to destroy fishing boats in line with the Commission proposal on the revision of the common fisheries policy, the majority of Members of this House declared themselves against, since the entire issue is currently being debated and since the information we have is incomplete.</p>
<p class="contents">The disagreement about any attempt to reprogramme or redistribute FIFG appropriations was also reaffirmed as was the principle that new means must be provided for new needs in order to protect the importance of the strategic sector of fisheries for the Community in general and for certain countries and regions in particular, given the deep-rooted link certain local and regional communities have with fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Other proposals crucial to the fisheries sector were also adopted, amongst which I would highlight the following: the creation of a Community support programme for coastal and small-scale fishing; increasing aid to the outermost regions; aid to aquiculture and to the processing industry, principally the canning industry; support for improving the monitoring of products that are placed on the market and support for improving and standardising control and monitoring systems and the increase in inspections and monitoring of fisheries activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development – and I myself – do not believe that too much money is flowing into agriculture and Europe's rural regions. The money may not be flowing into the right channels, but that is why there is a need for reform. We therefore oppose linear cuts because we believe that what is required are not linear cuts but qualified measures. Of course, a key element in this context is to dispense with export subsidies in a region which is one of the largest importers in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see the option of a transfer from the first to the second pillar. To this end, it is essential that we have co-decision rights in respect of the obligatory expenditure as well. That is an urgent requirement. We have specifically adopted amendments which go beyond the Institutional Agreement because we want to force a new agreement and debate. Mr Fischler, these needs are also identified in your reform proposals. The financial perspective must be amended. We would therefore like to support this. We will undoubtedly get bogged down in discussions again later, but we think this is acceptable in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the transfer to the second pillar, let me point out again that we have re-introduced our INPART programme. The name has been changed. We are now calling it LEADER-EAST, since we have progressed further along the road to enlargement. However, we still endorse the concept of establishing a bottom-up programme for the new Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like genetic resources to be transferred to the non-obligatory part. You are familiar with the issues. I think that the Commission will go along with this. We simply have to try and find sufficient funds here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express my warm thanks to the honourable Members for making it possible, for the first time, for us to debate next year's budget in Parliament even before the formal procedure begins. As far as agriculture and rural development are concerned, I am pleased to see that a series of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development call for the appropriations in heading 1a to be restored to the level proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, and that there is a desire to reverse the cuts made across the board by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I explicitly welcome the reinstatement of these appropriations and should like in addition to underline that the Commission's PDB had already provided for a margin of EUR 2.26 billion below the financial perspective ceiling that was set in Berlin. As you know, at the end of October the Commission will be tabling a letter of amendment to the PDB for the EAGGF Guarantee Section so as to take account of the very latest macroeconomic forecasts and recent legislative developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Today it is certainly still too early to quantify precisely the changes that could be proposed, but I can tell you which factors will be taken into consideration. Firstly, the devaluation of the US dollar compared with the euro will mean an increase in commitment appropriations, in particular for export refunds and some other payments. Secondly, the market situation in a number of sectors has unfortunately not improved since the preliminary draft budget was presented. This is the case in particular for milk and milk products, which is precisely the sector that has not yet undergone reform. Thirdly, and conversely, funds for direct payments in the arable crops sector will be cut in 2003. This follows on from the decisions we took in the summer in connection with the regions in Italy that were hit by severe drought and then the areas affected by the catastrophic flooding in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">In these cases, as you know, we have brought forward advance payments to the 2002 budget year and this is, after all, over EUR 900 million which will, as a result, no longer be needed in the 2003 budget. I would repeat, however, that this can only be a general indication of the content of the letter of amendment; it is too early to anticipate what it will say. For the purpose of the first reading of the draft budget the assumptions on the basis of which it was drawn up will obviously still apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also briefly to address the question, which I am asked so frequently, of the extent to which the proposals made in the context of the mid-term review will impact on the 2003 budget. To be quite plain, not at all, because the mid-term review can only come into force in 2004 and no legislative changes will therefore be made in the coming year which will make it possible to change the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In its motion, the Agriculture Committee calls for funds to be made available to European farmers in compensation for the extreme weather conditions by, for example, using the surplus in the current marketing year or by creating a disaster relief fund in heading 1b. I have already mentioned that we have brought forward significant payments in the arable crops sector. This actually ought to have the effect of substantially reducing the anticipated margin in the current agriculture budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as a disaster relief fund is concerned, the Commission has already proposed the creation of a solidarity fund, of at least EUR 500 million this year, but of EUR one billion in 2003, and a decision should be taken quickly on this. I would support the point made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that greater effort should be made to safeguard and improve the quality of agricultural products. However, this is not a matter that can be resolved in the context of the 2003 budget; it requires a longer-term strategy, the very strategy that we have set out in the mid-term review. It ought to be possible to achieve this in particular by changing the form and orientation of the support given to agriculture, for example by applying the principle of cross-compliance and by striking a better balance between the two pillars of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like very briefly, since Mrs Figueiredo addressed this, to mention three issues in connection with fisheries policy. The first is the need to keep the budget for external fisheries policy, which mainly consists of estimated costs of fisheries protocols, at current levels. At its first reading, the Council retained the figures in the preliminary draft budget. This is also absolutely essential if the Community is to be able to continue its fishing activities in third countries. The letter of amendment in the autumn will go into more detail on how the funds are to be split between the budget line and the reserve. In this context, I also welcome the support for our external fisheries policy, and in particular the fisheries agreements, that was voiced by the rapporteurs of the Budgets and Fisheries Committees.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the payment of the second instalment to the Spanish and Portuguese fleets that used to fish in Moroccan waters. This is the EUR 27 million. The Commission made an initial proposal in its preliminary draft budget, but so far this has not received the support of the budgetary authority. For the time being, however, the Commission does not see any alternative to using the flexibility instrument either.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is the impact of the reform on the budget, which will, by and large, be modest. The only proposal was to increase the scrapping fund by EUR 32 million. This would have an impact on the 2003 budget. The main problem with this fund is not its size but the budgetary framework. Here too the Commission has made a proposal in the letter of amendment to use the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issues raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf in connection with export subsidies, I can only make proposals on the basis of existing legislation. I cannot work on the basis of possibilities that might arise at some point in the future. As far as codecision for compulsory expenditure is concerned, this question first needs to be referred to the Convention. It would require the Treaties to be amended accordingly. Only then would it be possible to meet your request, but I should like to stress that the Commission shares the view that in future, agricultural policy and fisheries policy should be included under the codecision procedure.</p>

In my view – and this is a view shared by the majority of the Agriculture Committee – the 2003 budget, which is the subject of today's debate, is not the right context in which to discuss reform of the common agricultural policy. Neither is a debate assessing Commissioner Fischler's proposals on the mid-term review on today's agenda. Instead we should focus on the actual budgetary figures for the coming year and here there are two essential points which most definitely require a clear decision from us. Firstly, the Council is proposing a general reduction of 0.8% or 0.6% across all 1a lines, which amounts to a cut of EUR 275 million. Secondly, in the Agriculture Committee, our colleagues from the Greens proposed a drastic cut in export refunds; to be more precise they wanted to reduce all export refunds to zero. Neither of these proposals can be right today. It would send out the wrong signal. Accordingly, in a vote on a proposal tabled by the PPE Group, the Agriculture Committee rejected both proposals by a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite happy – and this may be a perfectly sensible course of action – to consider moving funds from the first to the second pillar, but only in the context of a dedicated debate on the mid-term review and on a codecision basis. Every year, to the great delight of the Member States, huge sums of money flow back to them from the agriculture budget. At present, the utilisation rate of the 2002 agriculture budget lines is around 80%. The reality of the situation does indeed support the call for better management and optimal use of agricultural funds. To mention the example of export refunds once more, this is another area where a great deal more could be done.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons we, along with the majority of the Committee on Agriculture, are against anticipating the results of the mid-term review. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course there are still a number of points that would merit further discussion. This is after all unquestionably a proposal for debate. What will be decisive for us, however, will also be the extent to which we will be able to transfer funds that have not been used in the first pillar to the second pillar in forthcoming budgets, and that also includes the 2003 budget, because the development of rural areas is something that we are of course all concerned about and it will certainly be an absolutely decisive factor in the future. The question is whether there is already any prospect now of going beyond the Interinstitutional Agreement and implementing this.</p>
<p class="contents">A further question is of course: how much progress has been made with implementing the SAPARD programme, Commissioner? What is the position with this LEADER-EAST programme, formerly known as INPART? I should also like to mention this once more.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also interesting for farmers to know – and you have only given vague hints about this in the mid-term review – what the future holds for the tobacco, sugar and milk sectors. What is going to happen about quotas in the milk sector? This too is a very important question.</p>

Two events are particularly important. The first is, of course, enlargement as the overarching consideration. The second is the draft mid-term review. An absolute distinction must be drawn between these events. They must not be merged together, as was done by Mr Goodwill a little while ago. Nor is that the aim. The 2003 budget is not influenced by the mid-term review. Nor is it intended that the mid-term review should have a particularly great influence upon the budget subsequently. What is interesting, rather, is that we are beginning a process of discussing the future of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted to see that Mr Färm’s report demands a fair and sustainable agricultural policy and praises the Commission’s proposal. I share that perspective and I wish, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to explain that we fully support that assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I was alarmed, as was Mr Goodwill, to read in the <span class="italic">Financial Times </span>yesterday that seven agricultural ministers clearly defend the agricultural policy in its present form. It is as if they are on a different planet. I hope that the European Parliament is able to support the Commission in its efforts to change and reform the policy in the future. I believe this is necessary and, even though we do not have any formal influence, our support is badly needed as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Leaving aside for the moment the fact that it is inhumane, the threat of war with Iraq is pushing oil prices up and boosting inflationary pressures. Economic results, especially in the manufacturing sector, are disappointing to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">Capitalism is in a state of deep crisis; all it can do now is cling to the stability pact and anti-labour policies, chip away at workers' rights and their standard of living and pensions, cut farmers' incomes and choke the life out of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union budget for 2003 is yet another example of this anti-grass roots policy in practice. Instead of redistributing any income, given that it accounts for less than 1.01% of Community GDP, it throws even more money at monopolies and at imperialist plans to suppress and exploit the people. A typical example is the agricultural economy: not only does the Community budget do nothing to reverse the decline in income of poor average farmers, who are being driven from the land in droves, but the system of prices and subsidies guarantees cheap raw materials and higher profits for the tobacco and other industries which process their products. The common agricultural policy and quotas have created a huge, EUR 25 billion trade deficit in the European Union, jobs are being lost and unemployment is rising.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives of big business for 2003 are obvious from the relative reduction in the amounts proposed, at a time when peoples' needs are increasing, unemployment is rising, the environment is being destroyed and so-called globalisation is giving rise to new forms of exploitation and spreading poverty and hunger across the planet. The limited sums available for structural policies, the reduction in agricultural spending and the funds earmarked for the common foreign policy, defence and security typify the aggressive attitude of capital towards the people and the role which the European Union is being called on to play as the sidekick of the USA as it polices the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to this policy and to the methods applied by big business. We reject the modus operandi of the monopolies, we are fighting with the workers to overturn these plans and we demand a different sort of policy, a policy which will bring about economic prosperity for the workers and secure their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why is the Commission banning fleet modernisation, whenever this is required, as in any other economic sector? Why is there no budget for economic and social measures to compensate for the effects of the reform?

<p class="contents">As regards the proposals for agricultural spending in the coming year, I note that the preliminary draft budget adopted by the Commission leaves a margin of EUR 2.3 billion under the ceiling agreed by the financial perspective. We are all aware of the current difficulties faced by farmers. Many colleagues come from Member States which were this summer struck by floods and landslides. Many farmers lost crops, animals and even their homes. The emergency aid voted through will go some way to help alleviate the problems faced. However, we should not be thinking of cutting back on farm expenditure and need to avail of the ample margins available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Ireland, there has been an almost 20% drop in farm incomes this year when inflation is factored in. In the industrial and service sector such a cut would never be accepted but farmers are expected to put up with the vagaries of world market prices which are currently at rock bottom across a range of commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, it is totally unacceptable that the Council has proposed an across-the-board reduction in agricultural spending in comparison with that which the Commission has proposed. The attempt by the Council to shave EUR 275 million off market expenditure in such hard-hit sectors as arable crops, milk, beef and mutton and lamb is completely out of order under the current climate.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as my own group is concerned, we have tabled a series of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage. I would highlight the number of lines where we believe there is a need to strengthen existing schemes. The school milk scheme, for example, has proved itself to be highly effective and must be continued and expanded. Similarly, installation aid for young farmers is a key component in ensuring the future of farming, particularly in the more isolated regions which have a structure of small family farms. Farming needs to be made an attractive career prospect and if we are to bring young qualified people into the profession, a failure to do so will lead to further depopulation of rural areas to the point where certain rural communities will no longer be sustainable. This has negative consequences also for urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I also strongly support information actions on the common agricultural policy. It is important to get the message across to European citizens that we are all beneficiaries of the European model of farming. What we are paying for is an agriculture that is environmentally sound, guarantees the highest levels of food safety and traceability and upholds standards of animal welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from this reservation, maintaining a margin of EUR 2.3 billion below the financial perspectives could be justified. But is the Commission prepared to mobilise these funds swiftly should the markets become stagnant?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take as an example the appropriations allocated to eradicating epizootic diseases and to the Emergency Veterinary Fund. These were severely reduced even though so much remains to be done, both in the field of prevention and in terms of research. The year 2003 will be characterised by an evolving CAP. Half way through, the Commission turned the review into a proposal for fundamental reform, which appears to ignore farmers and their wellbeing and turn them into mere tools.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this departure, which consists of divesting the CAP of any substance in the name of a so-called rural development policy, is a mistake, and I would like to hear the Commission’s reply to the following questions. Given that we originally chose a common agricultural policy, do you not think that it is the Union’s responsibility to pay at least as much attention to this sector as the United States, by allocating the corresponding financial means, rather than aiming to match world prices? How can we ensure that the ambition of European rural development does not encroach upon national and local competence in the field of land use planning? Is this not a way of promoting environmental concerns which are addressed under another budgetary heading? I wonder if this is really the role of the CAP. Do you think we can simultaneously try to bring our prices into line with world prices and increase production costs, while contenting ourselves with applying a ‘communicating vessels’ policy to the first and second pillars? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It angers me to hear that it is scandalous for the Union to devote 45% of its budget to agriculture. In fact, this 45% only represents 3% of the public budgets of the Union and the Member States. 3% of public budgets allocated to 5% of the population, 3% of public budgets allocated to 60% of EU territory, 3% of public budgets allocated to our food, our food safety, maintaining agricultural revenue and to the orientation of agriculture markets.</p>
<p class="contents">3% of public budgets allocated to agriculture is less than the percentage in the United States. According to the OECD, US agricultural policy costs USD 338 per taxpayer in comparison with USD 276 in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So, just as our US counterparts, in view of the failure of their previous agricultural act, the Fair Act, have decided to increase aid to agriculture by 70% at a time when some countries have the advantage of large areas of land, using advanced agricultural technologies, benefiting from extremely low labour costs, and implementing dumping policies that destabilise prices world-wide, we should not call into question the Berlin agreements by wanting to impose a reduction in our agriculture budgets within the EU. Nor must we let it be said that our agriculture budgets are an obstacle to progress in developing countries. Our CAP and the associated budgets offset the social and environmental restrictions we impose on our farmers, and aim to provide them with a comparable quality of life to that of the rest of the Union’s population. The developing countries, and in particular the poorest among them, have a high proportion of poor peasant farmers, and what these poor farmers need is not increased liberalism placing them in competition with largescale high-tech farming throughout the world, but, on the contrary, to be able to increase their productivity by selling their food products on regional or national markets. We must not aim for the wrong target. It is not our so-called protectionism that is causing poor third-world farmers to starve, but, on the contrary, dogmatic free trade aimed at placing farmers with vastly differing levels of technology and productivity in competition with each other. This, appropriately, was what the Senegalese and Indian Ministers for Agriculture were saying at Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, if we really want to reduce the public budgets allocated to agriculture, it is perhaps time to reopen discussions on Community preference, by defining a new, updated Community preference system that would allow the extra cost imposed on our agriculture sector by our high food safety, social, environmental and animal welfare requirements to be absorbed internally into the agriculture prices on the Community market. In order to do this, Mr President, Commissioners, we must firmly turn our back on the aberrant dogma of world prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As for fisheries, this Commissioner has also launched far-reaching proposals aimed at sustainable fisheries, that are also in line with the agreements made at the Johannesburg Summit finally to reach true sustainable fisheries. At the same time, there is something lacking there; I note with regard to the fisheries budget that this decisiveness is not translated into major shifts or priorities in the fisheries budget up to 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">You could, of course, claim that the fisheries policy is only partly being launched, but I should nevertheless like to mention a few points concerning the fisheries policy. Parliament and the Council have indicated that we consider it important, as a result of the failure in Spain of the fisheries agreements with Morocco, that money be set aside for the regions in question. The Committee on Fisheries insists on this being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are facing far-reaching decisions. This means that the responsibility of fishermen is considerable and that producer groups in the fisheries sector deserve extra support in this. We have tabled specific amendments in this area too and would greatly appreciate it if the Commission were to adopt them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, far-reaching decisions in the fisheries sector also means that a number of regions will actually be affected. I would refer to cod fishing in Scotland, but also to areas along the North Sea. This means that employment, namely indirect employment in the ports and indirect employment in the fish-processing industry, will be badly affected in those regions. In this respect, Europe needs to invest to create replacement employment, also in terms of sustainability in those regions. We would, in this connection, like the Commission seriously to consider, and subsequently adopt, a number of amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither do I wish to comment on the reform of agricultural policy. My contribution will be confined to reiterating yet again my request for cofinancing. I have been asking for this for three years now. That should be enough!</p>
<p class="contents">I am here as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as a shadow rapporteur. The person I am shadowing, Robert Goodwill – who is the rapporteur for the budget – has already left. All of the areas of agricultural policy on which I have questions or which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tackled have already been addressed by him or other colleagues. The first is tobacco subsidies. This issue has been raised time and again since 1994. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is calling for tobacco subsidies to be abolished. Obviously the Committee on Budgets cannot accommodate this request because we have a market organisation and we have to work within the legislative framework. Hence my very specific question to you, Mr Fischler: when is the Commission finally going to table a proposal explaining how it will contrive gradually to convert the areas under tobacco? I know that there is any amount of discussion about this. And I do not mean these half-baked ideas which are envisaged for the tobacco fund. Neither is it acceptable for you to answer that it is all far too expensive because converting jobs – in whatever sector – costs anything from EUR 31 000 to EUR 391 000.</p>
<p class="contents">My next question concerns the Food Safety Authority. When are you finally going to put pressure on the Council to let us have the Food Safety Authority?</p>

However, I have a question on the period that follows. In the Böge report on enlargement, which we adopted in May of this year, Parliament asked the Commission to outline agricultural policy after 2006 and what the expenses would roughly be. The mid-term review does not include the milk quotas reform, but options are given instead. What are the costs of those options? Are there, within the framework of changing the sugar policy, plans in connection with Everything but Arms, and what are the costs involved?</p>
<p class="contents">My next point concerns next year's budget and also, to some extent, this year's. Parliament had tabled a number of amendments to examine how we could protect ourselves against the outbreak of infectious animal diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, and how more funding can be made available for the development of marker vaccines and ancillary testing methods. As far as I know, it is nearly October and the Commission has shown no intention of launching these initiatives. Some preparatory work has been done, but neither of the studies has been started. It is, in my view, extremely serious that approximately nine months following the adoption of the budget, not even a start has been made on two issues that are so important for public opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the Commission wants – and it has let this be known – the reformed CFP to enter into force in 2003, it is asking us to decide immediately on the appropriations which, according to the Commission, the reform will imply: EUR 32 million payable by means of the flexibility instrument, intended to finance the specific measure for scrapping vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is that this Parliament has yet to give its opinion on the fundamental elements of this issue. This proposed scrapping means the disappearance of 28 000 fishing jobs in Europe, it has been rejected in general by the sector and this House has demanded further details from Commissioner Fischler as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has delayed the presentation of its proposals horrendously and they are also partly the result of this delay. The Commission, for its preliminary draft budget, should – we believe – have worked on the basis of the Resolution approved by this Parliament in relation to the Green Paper on the reform. This Resolution approved by the European Parliament rejected the reduction of aid to the fleets while, on the other hand, the Commission is proposing to remove it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the outstanding commitments for the restructuring of the Moroccan fleet, we would ask the House for them to be included in the budget, in accordance with the approved Resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that I need to return to the last question, put by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, about these 32 million and the 27 million, as I already dealt with this in my first intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have indicated that they are opposed to these across-the-board cuts of 0.8% and I too am against a systematic cut of this kind; furthermore I believe that generally speaking this is a book-keeping exercise and not a political act. Policy-making is after all actually about deploying resources selectively and not simply applying the same iron-fisted approach across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members asked why there are no proposals on tobacco, sugar or milk in the mid-term review. I should like to remind you that a study is underway on tobacco; this study will be completed at the end of the year. From the outset – and we have also discussed this several times here in this Parliament – the intention was that we should table a proposal for a new type of market organisation for tobacco next year. The same, incidentally, applies to sugar. It is quite clear that the market organisation that we have for sugar at the moment will not be able to survive in its current form, particularly if you take into account the impact that the 'Everything but Arms' initiative will have once the transitional period has elapsed, and that changes will therefore be necessary. Here too, however, I have already informed Parliament several times that we intend to work on these next year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as milk is concerned, in principle this is contained in the mid-term review, which also makes it clear that the Commission is prepared at any time to make a legislative proposal adjusting the common organisation of the market in milk, but only if it is clear that the Member States are prepared politically to go in a particular direction. At present we actually have no chance of getting anywhere near the necessary majority in the Council. That then is also why it makes little sense to table a legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Cofinancing – and I know that for many of you this is a pet subject – is not an appropriate topic for discussion in a debate on an annual budget; it is something for the next financial perspective. That is the context in which it needs to be discussed because it does of course go far beyond agriculture alone. Incidentally, the provisions on cofinancing will in any case be changed or extended to some extent if we transfer funds from the first to the second pillar because cofinancing is automatically guaranteed in the second pillar. In this regard I can only agree with all of those who referred here to yesterday's article in <span class="italic">The Financial Times</span>, because although on the one hand in this article it is stated that the common agricultural policy is better than its reputation – a sermon that I preach around once every week – it is also clear that people want to see rural development given a boost and that they wish to have better quality and food safety. The only thing is that when it comes to practical implementation we also have to say where the money to boost rural development is going to come from. There is only one source of money available here and that is the first pillar. Anyone who tries to deny this fact does not exactly help us to make real progress with this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, incidentally, to make one more comment on this article, namely that, as I see it, it is becoming clear that agricultural policy has taken a turn for the better in those areas where there has been a willingness to implement appropriate reforms. An unwillingness to reform does not do either agricultural policy or farmers any favours.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question about modernising the fleet and why we are blocking this, I do not wish to provoke a debate on fisheries reform now – we have sufficient opportunity to discuss these issues – but I should simply like to remind you that the Commission's proposals do not contain any provision on compulsory scrapping of a particular number of vessels in a particular segment in a particular Member State; we simply open up possibilities. Each shipowner continues to have the right to decide and no individual or Member State is being ordered or forced to scrap. It is time that these allegations stopped, because they only help to perpetuate bad feeling amongst fishermen. We really must discuss this on the basis of the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">If you say that the bad weather in Ireland has had such a serious effect on farmers' income, then I can assure you that we are also prepared to help Ireland. In this case, of course, we are not talking primarily about advance payments for arable premiums, but mainly about premiums for cattle. We are prepared to transfer the advances as early as 16 October, the first day on which the money is available.</p>
<p class="contents">I will just comment briefly on the question of research into animal diseases. Research has to be addressed within the research budget. Research into animal diseases also takes place in the research framework programme and not in our own budget. We have to ensure that this is a focus of research work, and we have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maat is right to say that there can be no particular shift in the financial priorities in the year 2003, but in both sectors – agriculture and fisheries – we have a little chicken-and-egg problem. Some say that policy can only be designed on the basis of a budget, which means that you first have to enter more resources in the budget or transfer funds from elsewhere so that you can choose to reform within a sound legal framework. Others say that we first need to know what the policy looks like before we can talk about the financial resources that will be required. This is the practice that has been observed by Parliament hitherto. That is why it is important for us to take further steps towards reforming fisheries and agriculture. Only then can we actually determine the specific sums involved in detail. If you do not know the policy it makes the calculations very difficult.</p>

Both Parliament and the Commission have touched upon important themes concerning the 2003 budget. I have taken note of the various points of view, and I can assure you that I shall pass them on to my colleagues in the Council. I should nonetheless like to add a number of observations to a couple of the speeches that have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the European Parliament, the Council is particularly alert to the large surplus in respect of the EU budget, amounting last year to EUR 15 000 million. Today’s debate has indicated both the Commission’s and the Member States’ responsibility in this area, and this needs to be followed up. With regard to the mid-term review of agricultural policy, I should like to emphasise that the Danish Presidency will do what it can to further the negotiations on reform. Another important topic on which the Council and the European Parliament must find common solutions is that of setting up the special fund for dealing with the consequences of the floods in Central Europe. Yesterday evening, we had an extraordinary trialogue on this subject, and I am pleased to be able to say that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are agreed that the necessary decisions can be taken and legal acts adopted before the end of October. I anticipate the Council’s being able to make the necessary contribution to this process. There is now already in theory an agreement to establish a fund of up to EUR 1 000 million per year, and it is important for the EU as quickly as possible to be able to step up its aid to the victims of the floods in Austria, Germany and the candidate countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 September, my colleague Bertel Haarder, Minister for European Affairs, presented here in Parliament the result of the Council’s first reading of the 2003 budget and took the opportunity of emphasising the agreements and the common understandings resulting from the meeting for consultation on 19 July. I am very pleased with this result. It means a lot to the Danish Presidency that we have full backing in the Council for discussing crucial topics with Parliament at an early stage. It was agreed on 19 July that the administrative preparation for enlargement is a main priority that the institutions will be able to address from now on and throughout 2003, and I should like to emphasise that the administrative basis for enlargement has been secured by means of the agreement on administrative expenditure for 2003. This early agreement also gives the institutions the best possible basis for planning in connection with the preparation for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also, here today, been a very thorough debate on the EU’s external tasks. In that connection, it is encouraging that a common understanding has been reached of the need to work towards securing funding for the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the light of essential new tasks. As I mentioned to begin with, an important priority in this connection is the EU’s assumption of responsibility for the UN’s policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are also agreed about trying to reach an agreement on involving Parliament in the CFSP arrangements within the framework of the Treaty. The fact that the emergency aid reserve for humanitarian assistance can now also be used for civil crisis management is also a significant result. In June, a common understanding was also reached about the need to fund the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets and about the need to keep the overall payment appropriations as low as possible. I am of course aware that that there is still a way to go before we can enter into a final joint agreement on the 2003 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate has helped clarify Parliament’s and the Commission’s ideas and attitudes, and I am certain that we can continue the sound cooperation between the institutions and, together, find the necessary solutions so that, in December, a budget can be adopted based on a detailed prioritising of EU funds within the financial estimates. In this way, we shall be able jointly to meet the challenges of the next few years. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have never done anything like this before. In the main it has been successful. Granted, some Members just made standard speeches, but there has been some good debate and we have had some good responses. We have also had some confusing responses, especially on the Global Health Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank all those who have taken part, especially the individual Commissioners, and Mrs Schreyer for being here all the time. I should also like to thank the President-in-Office. During this presidency, the Danes have achieved several firsts in the budget procedure and to sit here for four and a half hours is a massive first. It has never been done before.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I must also note that Mr Elles' speech in which he set out six priorities of the PPE-DE Group was very good. Three of them seemed to have more to do with getting British Conservatives onto the list, which is going ahead at present, than with budgetary rigour or budgetary sense. I am sure Mr Elles will take that in the manner in which it is meant.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all it has been a good debate and I should like to thank all those who have taken part.</p>

<p class="contents">Delightful because of the amount: EUR 100 billion. This is the highest budget we have seen since 1958.</p>
<p class="contents">Detrimental with regard to agriculture. The percentage of agricultural appropriations in spending as a whole is being relentlessly eroded and, in particular, the appropriations authorised in financial forecasts are never used to the full. Over ten years, if we add up the annual differences between the agricultural budgets implemented, on the one hand, and the agricultural budgets voted for and the estimated agricultural financial forecasts, on the other, the equivalent of an annual agricultural budget has been spirited away. The EUR 40 or so billion that have been stolen from European farmers could have been used to save our apiarists, promote our wines and create a European fund against natural disasters. In the Languedoc area, for example, where flooding in September destroyed 4000 hectares of vineyards.</p>
<p class="contents">Disastrous, because 2003 will be the last year before we jump into the bottomless pit of globalisation without a safety net. It is the year of Cancun and the WTO Ministerial Conference that will seal the world agreement on agricultural free trade. It is also the year in which there will be real conflict over the CAP review, with a powerful ally for Mr Fischler in Renate Kunas. It is also the beginning of our descent down the slippery slope of enlargement, with the accession of the Eastern European agricultural countries bringing unknown costs in real terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
