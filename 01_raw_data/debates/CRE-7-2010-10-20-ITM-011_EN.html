<p class="contents">I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on the current situation in Ukraine. I should like to make my remarks in the light of three important upcoming events: the EU-Ukraine Ministerial meeting which will take place in Luxembourg on 26 October, the local elections which will take place on 31 October, and the 14th EU-Ukraine Summit which will be held in Brussels on 22 November.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent times, Ukraine has enjoyed a high level of political freedoms. Successive elections have been recognised as having been conducted in accordance with international standards. Ukraine has developed a dynamic and diverse civil society and media environment. There have been consistent improvements across the board with regard to respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence of these developments and of the commitment of successive governments to the path of closer ties with the European Union, relations between the European Union and Ukraine have acquired considerable momentum. This is reflected most clearly in the ambitious and far-reaching European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement which we are currently negotiating, and which aims at achieving the twin goals of political association and economic integration with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">President Yanukovych’s government has undertaken a number of important economic reforms in recent months, which should be commended. These include the adoption of a public procurement law, which should play an important role in the fight against corruption and in increasing competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of a gas sector reform law, which paves the way for Ukraine’s imminent accession to the Energy Community Treaty, as well as the agreement it recently reached with the IMF for a standby agreement, are also critical steps in securing macro-financial stability, transparency and a return to growth. These reforms go in the right direction and must be sustained.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ukrainian Government has also managed to achieve a level of stability which has eluded Ukraine’s political establishment in recent years. This is an important and necessary development in ensuring effective governance of the country. Nonetheless, we are concerned at consistent and widespread reports of a deterioration in respect for fundamental freedoms and democratic principles in Ukraine. Particularly worrying are complaints related to freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect of these fundamental values is essential. They are the best guarantors of individual freedoms. They ensure a genuine competition of ideas. They are an essential component of truly open, innovative and competitive societies.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 October, the Ukrainian Constitutional Court handed down a judgment which overturned constitutional changes made after the 2004 Orange Revolution. This decision only increases the need for Ukraine to achieve wider constitutional reform through an inclusive constitutional reform process and, to a great extent, takes up a key theme of the European Parliament’s resolution of 25 February this year. Such a process should seek to establish an effective and lasting constitutional system of checks and balances in accordance with European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union and our Member States, respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are fundamental principles that bind us together. They are principles that cannot be compromised, so too for our relations with key partners such as Ukraine. The pace and depth of our rapprochement with Ukraine will be determined by full respect of these values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Disturbing reports from Ukraine, however, indicate developments that distance the country from Europe. That is why we are having this debate ahead of the municipal elections. We will be able to discuss economic reforms in November in connection with the EU-Ukraine summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to talk about intimidation by the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press and the ability to take part in the elections unhindered. Developments like this cannot be balanced out by positive news in the economic sphere. ‘Economic prosperity through authoritarian rule’ is a Chinese approach, not a European one. Those who hold power in Ukraine today should not be allowed to believe that they can escape just because the broad European public takes no notice or because the previous government admittedly did have failings in relation to good governance and combating corruption. These things are true, yet there was no atmosphere of being watched, there were no visits from the secret police, as has been experienced by the rector of the Catholic University of Lviv and by young people involved in NGOs and opposition parties. Cutting off power to businesses, seizing computers, occupying party offices on the grounds of supposed risks of attacks – the whole gamut of the <span class="italic">déjà vu</span> is on show in Ukraine. There is method to it. The secret police is headed by Mr Khoroshkovsky, who actually runs a media empire and is now also a member of the committee to appoint the most senior judge in the country. That, too, distances Ukraine from Europe. There is little left of equality of opportunity in the political contest before the municipal elections. The opposition is being partially excluded from the elections, while puppet parties are being spontaneously formed and authorised to take part in the elections by compliant local authorities. In Kiev, the district councils are being unceremoniously abolished so that no elections are taking place there – the governing party knows that it will not win there are the moment. The power vertical has the objective of achieving control over regions that have previously been inclined to disagree with it.</p>
<p class="contents">We put forward our European experience as an alternative. Our Member States took important decisions in democratic consensus between government and an opposition ready to take responsibility – for European reforms, for the rule of law, for a competitive market economy, for European integration. We want Ukraine to continue down this road with us.</p>

Today is the right time to leave this government to deliver, and not to prejudge its achievements or non-achievements from the first minutes of its mandate.

<p class="contents">Economic cooperation has always been Europe’s most powerful engine for greater integration and Europe has owed its success to this pragmatic approach since 1956.</p>

There are more and more reports about the repression of the freedom of expression of journalists, regular threats to committed individual members of the NGOs and people working for democratic development. The role of the secret police, too, gives real cause for concern. However, I do not believe that the altercations about freedom of the press and democratic development in general begin with the last election, rather – and I have said this here often – all the leading players in Ukraine have repeatedly abused their power for purposes including bringing their own interests to fruition. This abuse is getting worse and that really must concern us.</p>
<p class="contents">We would be doing ourselves no favours if we were to adopt this resolution without being worried about certain economic developments in Ukraine. I am watching with just as much concern how Russia’s influence on the Ukrainian economy, its energy sector, but also other sectors, has been systematically expanded. I would therefore also advise that we do not have to vote tomorrow but instead after the delegation has visited Kiev – a delegation is going there the weekend after next – and before we have the summit here, after careful preparation in all areas to agree what the European Parliament’s position actually is regarding the situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">I have gone down this path from the pre-democratic times to the new times with numerous Ukrainian friends. Ukraine was on a very good path. It was our impression that the last elections took place in accordance with democratic conventions. If the situation should not now improve, but instead worsen, we should nonetheless consider very carefully how we intervene and how we do not intervene. In any case, I would advise against making a decision before our next visit to Ukraine. Our voice will be louder if we bring up the debate on the things about which we have spoken in the resolution over there.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, I really am concerned. I am receiving a lot of reports that everything is heading in a negative direction. However, we would be doing ourselves no favours if we were to rule out debate on the ground over there and make too fast and too hasty a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we always stressed the fact that the aim of our involvement in Ukraine was not to support any particular political force, but to help make Ukraine a democratic and free country. Today, we should remember that the European Parliament did not play a role in Ukraine’s internal politics, but acted as a guardian in two very important ways: on the one hand, by upholding and assisting Ukrainians’ European aspirations and, on the other, by upholding democracy, human rights and all the values we regard as European values in Ukraine. I say that the tone of the proposed resolution is not one which will help those who regard themselves as friends of Ukraine. Today’s resolution will only push Ukraine closer to Russia, and to those who say, ‘you will see, there is no room for us in the West. It is closing its doors to us’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be open to Ukraine, we have to tell it what European standards are, and we must keep up the pressure to ensure they are observed, while, on the other hand, we must absolutely prevent Ukraine from returning to the East. I would like to ask Mr Gahler, whose involvement in human rights and international politics I value greatly, why he finds it necessary to use such damning words about Ukraine.

That was on Monday. In brief, Ukraine is the Wild West of Eastern Europe. Foreign investors are said to fear the lawlessness that reigns in this country where, last week, no fewer than 3 000 buildings and companies were expropriated through fraud and violence. This process involves wide boys acting in cahoots with the country’s politicians to dupe entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, Member States of the EU have been the largest direct foreign investors in Ukraine since 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Füle, are you aware of these major concerns which affect European investors in Ukraine and what specific steps has the Commission taken to protect legitimate, legal European business interests in the Ukrainian economy? That would be showing commitment. We have nothing against Ukraine. My party even strongly advocates Ukraine’s eventual membership of the European Union, but we do have to maintain a sober perspective, of course.

When, however, even the financial markets judge the new government to be more stable and predictable than the government put in place by the Orange Revolution, that is probably a sign that democracy according to Western – according to our European – preconceptions cannot be transposed on a one-to-one basis to every country, including to those of the post-Communist sphere of influence. The current decision by the Constitutional Court would indeed strengthen the position of the President and weaken that of the parliament, of that we can be sure. Those who know the region say that a <span class="italic">de facto</span> presidential system was already in place before the <span class="italic">pro forma</span> court judgment. Growing restrictions on the freedom of the press and of opinion put Mr Yanukovych’s reassurances that democratic standards will be maintained in doubt. If the President succeeds in both reinforcing his own power base and achieving an economic recovery by carrying out central reforms in Ukraine, which is, of course, one of the poorest countries of this continent, he will perhaps keep himself on his presidential throne for longer and I believe that that would be something that, plainly and simply, the European Union would have to take note of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present ruling élite has been exercising power since the election of President Yanukovych and much of what has been done points in the direction of favouring the concentration of power.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more striking if we recall the results of the presidential elections which gave Yanukovych a small majority and demonstrated that he had strong support in the south and east of the country only. Yet – and this is the striking feature of Ukrainian politics currently – there has been a steady movement in the direction of marginalising alternative centres of power. The media, rule of law, the opposition, the autonomy of the state administration, have all been affected. What is particularly worrying is that the secret police have acquired the capacity to intervene very extensively in the affairs of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">All this augurs badly for the future, especially if Ukrainians genuinely seek a European future, because the system being built by Yanukovych points away from Europe, not towards it.</p>
<p class="contents">The most that can be said for the changes is that they have brought a degree of stability to the country, but increasingly, this stability foreshadows stasis and immobility. At the same time, it is true, Yanukovych has certainly improved relations with Russia, but has thereby accepted a degree of subordination to Moscow that is new. Whether Ukrainian society will accept this transformation in the longer term is an open question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those would be the only situations in which we should sit up all night drafting resolutions, sitting down at the negotiating table the next day. We are negotiating in such a way that the absolute majority simply dominate the way the resolutions are worded and what they say. The language of the draft resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is the language used to condemn African dictators and South American regimes. This is not the right kind of language to use for the situation in Ukraine. I would like the members of the PPE to decide whether we should describe Ukraine using the language of Commissioner Füle, who says ‘yes, but...’, or in other words that some things are good, but there are a lot of things we do not like, or whether we should use negative language, whereby there is nothing we like, and everything is to be condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine was in chaos for five years. We witnessed this chaos. We helped the democrats and we helped everyone who wanted to move towards the European Union. We have had six months of consolidation, consolidation which may have a negative outcome, and our job is to point out these negative outcomes, but not now and not in this manner. I understand the PPE’s regret that Yulia Tymoshenko lost the elections, but I say to you: it is unfortunate, maybe she had a chance of winning, but she lost. Now she has lost, let us acknowledge what is really happening and let us keep the Ukrainian authorities under careful observation, but let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one which will bring great changes in relations between the EU and Ukraine. I also thank Mrs Harms for her balanced position, and her wise – as ever – words on the subject of Ukraine. All information from the OSCE shows that Ukraine is one of the few countries of the former Soviet Union in which proper elections have, to date, been held. This is an achievement of Ukraine, both on the orange and on the blue side. It is an achievement that we cannot question before the next elections are over. It would be a serious political error on the part of the European Union and our Parliament if we listened to the voice of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and threw doubt on the fact that elections can be held successfully in one of very few countries in the East. Let us help Ukraine conduct normal elections. Let us not make any judgments before they have been held.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the Ukrainian guests present in this House today: Ukraine’s place is here, in this Chamber, and that is why we are subjecting you to the same standards that we apply to the countries of the European Union. That is what you fought for together, whether blue or orange. Every issue, even the tiniest one, to do with human rights or press freedom will be scrutinised here. Do not be surprised – I am talking to our Ukrainians brothers. That is because you are being treated as a European country, according to European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">My last appeal to you is to act together in your dealings with the European institutions and Parliament. We believe that in the future, you will be among us. We know that it will not happen soon, but we want to help you with this. I agree with Mrs Harms that the time for resolutions is after the elections. It is then, before the EU summit, that we will be able to discuss the issue frankly and draft a position with which to present the European Parliament’s common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we cannot be indifferent to what happens in that country. On 1 October, tens of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest against the constitutional changes initiated by Yanukovych and confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the composition of which was changed shortly after the election of the President. These reforms were carried out without democratic debate and without the agreement of the Venice Commission. The changes weaken the balance of power and threaten the independence of the judiciary in Ukraine. Economic reforms are also put under threat. Our Ukrainian friends have expressed concern over the organisation of the coming elections, over the excessive representation of the ruling coalition in the Central Electoral Commission, the restrictions on non-governmental organisations and state interference in the activities of opposition parties. This is precisely why this resolution is needed today. Unfortunately, the ruling coalition rejected the opposition motion in the Ukrainian parliament to make membership of the European Union a priority of Ukraine’s foreign policy. We must, however, continue to stress the importance of cooperation with Ukraine and monitor the implementation of agreements that have been concluded. The European Union must demand that corruption be fought and, at the same time, help in that fight, and that press freedom be ensured. A situation in which a media magnate at one and the same time both heads the state security service and is a member of the High Judicial Council, which has the power to appoint and dismiss judges, is not characteristic of a democratic state. In conclusion, we also need to take positive steps, providing not only for the introduction of a visa-free regime in the future, but also economic cooperation, especially in the energy sphere, while, at the same time, we await the democratic development of Ukraine. That would be the objective of the next resolution, which we should draw up after the election, and should cover energy, the economy and other issues of significance for Ukraine. Thank you.</p>

<p class="contents">I must remind you that six months ago, the country was in freefall and on the verge of falling into chaos. We had political, economic and financial instability – even a deep crisis – but now we have a very different picture. We have to recognise that in the space of a few months, the Ukraine Government has succeeded in bringing the country back to normal; back to political, economic and financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">There are problems. We do not deny that. But we must admit that they are listening to our voice; some corrective measures have been taken, for example, on the issues of electoral law and some electoral practices. In this sense, our voice will be heard there as long as we do not cry out on each occasion, but adopt a decent approach to Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think we are doing a disservice to our parliamentary committee which is going to Ukraine in 10 days time; we are doing ourselves a disservice in undermining our own role by adopting such resolutions 10 days before the elections. Such a move has never happened before. It is a clear attempt to influence the elections. We should not allow our parliament to be part of this game.</p>

I agree with what Mr Kamiński and others have said. We definitely need action from the European Parliament to contribute to the development of democracy and the improvement of conditions for the mutual development of relationships. Efforts to support stabilising actions by the Ukrainian Government apparently stepped on the toes of some of those who revel in chaos and lawlessness.

Moreover, we must also recognise the fact that he probably remembers the earlier period when he was victimised by the orange league, and the European Union reacted by simply smiling benevolently. Unless we want to lose Ukraine as our future member, let us be patient and concentrate on economic cooperation; let us build up a climate of mutual trust.

This is a good thing, as there have certainly been a few serious problems in recent years and the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, had a serious effect on the gas supplies of EU Member States. Subsequently, it was, of course, clear that Russia stopped the gas supplies during the price discussions and my home country of Austria, alone, experienced a fall of 33% in supplies of Russian gas, while France, Hungary and Italy also recorded drops of 20 to 40%. This calls for the Commission – as coordinator of the Energy Community – to grab Ukraine by the arm and remind it of its obligations when it comes to Europe’s security of supply. The energy supply of our Member States cannot simply be allowed to become a pawn in the price war between Russia and Ukraine.

There are indeed some worrying authoritarian trends in Kiev, from attempts to re-establish the temniki censorship of press freedom to the use of the FBU security service, led by an oligarch for political purposes. However, the West is watching the process closely. President Yanukovych is now under pressure. The legacy of the Orange Revolution is still strong and the Ukrainian civil society that emerged from it very robust.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone knows that I have close relations with the opposition’s leading figures, but I, too, think we should avoid too much interference in Ukrainian internal domestic and political affairs which may well backfire on this Parliament and we should give the ...</p>

We decided that we would issue a resolution after the elections, and that is what we did. We called upon the government and the opposition to observe human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">Several months have gone by since that resolution, and we can already see that some of its provisions have not been observed. I therefore understand the concern that the local elections, which are key in terms of fostering democracy, strengthening it and establishing it, may involve certain rights being violated. That, too, is why I am one of the authors of the resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">First, let me respond to a concrete question by Mr Belder concerning the investment and business environment. More needs to be done in Ukraine in this field. That is obvious, and I have raised this question a number of times, whether in the framework of the Association Council or in the framework of various meetings. The last time I had the opportunity to raise this issue was with Prime Minister Azarov, just last week. There are a number of issues, such as the procurement law and the possibility of going back on this law through various amendments which are now being debated in the Ukrainian Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">More needs to be done as far as the rule of law is concerned and, of course, we have watched with great interest the Mittal case in recent days. More needs to be done to deliver on the commitment and promises made to deal with the VAT issue, which is also an irritant for our businesses. Through our contacts with the Ukrainian authorities, and through regular contacts with businessmen, we are set to protect the interests of European investors and European businessmen.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that it is not an easy process in which we are engaged with Ukraine. This is a process where proclamations about the European future might sometimes be helpful, but will not deliver. What is going to deliver is building more of the European Union within Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">They need our assistance. They also need us to give them a reality check from time to time. That is what they expect from us.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not need is to be pushed into a false debate about what is more important: stability or adherence and commitment to values, and that leads me to my third point.</p>
<p class="contents">Who am I to comment on the draft resolution before this House, but I think the very fact that this debate has happened has already given a valuable signal. I think the fact that this House’s representatives are going to Ukraine soon, and will pass on most of these messages, conveys a very valuable message in itself. I think that another very valuable message in terms of what we should expect from the Ukrainians is that the forthcoming local elections on 31 October will reconfirm the democratic stance of their country.</p>

I have spoken with Mr Markert and he told me what he actually said. That is why the joint resolution no longer contains the quotation. You can see, therefore, that this is no longer a subject of debate.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about the rule of law in general. However, I would have liked to have heard you, as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, say something clear and specific about the things that the secret police do there. When parties there are not permitted to take part in elections, that is something that you can criticise even before an election, as, in such circumstances, the results of the election obviously cannot meet democratic and European standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its size, location and the vicissitudes of history make it an important bridge between East and West. It is hardly surprising that now as before, Europe is closely following political events within Ukraine. However, the current picture is not without ambiguity. We must recognise that the new government was elected in free and democratic elections and it helped pull Ukraine out of the economic and political chaos that dominated six months ago. On the other hand, we cannot ignore tendencies in the area of media freedom that cause concern. However, I agree with colleagues who stated that today’s resolution is ill-timed. I think we must postpone it, and following the visit by a European Parliament delegation scheduled for next week, following the coming council elections and the EU-Ukraine High-Level Meeting, we would be able to give a more balanced and objective parliamentary position. After all, Ukraine may provide a good example to other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States of how to go down the route of rapprochement with the EU while, at the same time, fostering good relations with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
