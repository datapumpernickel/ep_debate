It seems extraordinary that this Parliament, which represents the people of Europe, is not addressing this question this week, given the deepening of the crisis since the Commission last spoke.</p>
<p class="contents">I obviously have a particular concern in that this crisis is threatening a EUR 15bn food industry in the Republic of Ireland because of the steps we have had to take to ensure that foot-and-mouth disease does not get a hold there. It seems to me that this is a matter of concern not just to people in Ireland but to people everywhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, Madam President, to take the initiative and request the Commissioner to come to Parliament this week to make an up-to-date statement on this crisis. I am quite sure that we can find at least 30 minutes to enable the Commissioner to do that, and to demonstrate that this is a credible political forum for the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Rules of Procedure do not give me the authority to take this step. A debate was held at the Conference of Presidents to determine whether this question should be included in the agenda for this part-session. I would reiterate that this was already discussed, at the previous part-session of 28 February. In the end, the Conference of Presidents decided to let the Commission keep a very close eye on this situation and to hold a debate at an appropriate time. This question was, therefore, very central to the concerns of the Conference of Presidents. There has, however, been no request for an amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I respect the point you make, that this was discussed by the Conference of Presidents last week and given the situation at that time it was decided not to place it on the agenda this week.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I just point out the number of outbreaks in the UK yesterday was higher than at any time in the three weeks since the crisis started. The situation is now out of control and even though the British Agriculture Minister is insisting there is no crisis, the whole of the EU views with alarm what is happening in the UK. Ireland has a particular interest, but so do the French, as do all of us in the 15 Member States and beyond. The situation has changed so much since the matter was discussed by the Council of Presidents that I would urge you to find time, perhaps during the discussion of the regulation you have just referred to, for us to have a Commission update this week here in Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">I am not raising this subject with the intention of embarrassing the British Government in any way, but I am extremely concerned for European farmers, for the British farmers who are bearing the brunt of the crisis at the present time, and, in particular, I am concerned for farmers in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be aware that Ireland depends more than any other Member State of the European Community on the beef industry. We export 90% of our entire production. For that reason it is extremely important that the most severe restrictions are put into place in Great Britain. I believe you should invite the Commissioner to come and give his views on the overwhelming crisis that we are going through at the present time.

So I think that – as you, yourself, have implied – we should be able to decide in a free vote today whether we wish to include an update on this issue on the agenda, contrary to the Conference's original decision. There is one problem, however. In essence, of course, the Council is also called upon to make a statement on this issue, so I would ask that, if possible, it should also be discussed when a representative of the Council is present, as this will hopefully give us the information we need for our decision making.

We do not want to wait until the Commission kindly grants us a debate; we call upon the Commission to come here to Parliament and discuss the issue with us. We send out the same appeal to the Council as well, and in this regard I am rather more forceful than Mr Swoboda.

As one of my colleagues from Ireland mentioned, it cannot be taken in isolation because of the amount that Ireland exports. European tax-payers are funding the live export of animals, which is just exacerbating the situation. We have to stop live exports. In fact, that is what is responsible for bringing it into Northern Ireland. Luckily, the Irish Government has been able to contain it; the same goes for Britain.

We now know that the Echelon system does exist and that the US National Security Agency is, in all likelihood, the main user of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">For some days now, Members of the European Parliament have had reason to wonder whether the Commission’s internal communications are being treated as confidential. At a meeting of the Temporary Committee investigating the Echelon affair, a senior official responsible for the encryption of confidential information said that he had always been on very good terms with the NSA in Washington and that they check our systems on a regular basis to ensure that they really are secure and are being used correctly. He said that he was extremely pleased to see that the American secret service had tried for two weeks but had not been able to break the encryption.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take a lighter view of this, it is almost like a bank manager asking some safe-breakers to check that the bank’s safes were secure and, if they said that they were indeed secure, he would take their word for it. I think that we can draw an analogy between this situation and our own.</p>
<p class="contents">The clarifications and denials made by this official’s superiors were hardly convincing. I do not think that any Member here was swayed by them. I think that this is, therefore, a political problem, not just an implausible affair and it should be cleared up in Parliament. That is why we are calling for Mr Patten, the Commissioner responsible, to explain the current situation to us and we shall then decide how to follow this up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not repeat what my fellow Member, Mr Lannoye quite rightly said – I wholeheartedly agree with him. I spoke to you, Madam President, on this very same subject at the beginning of the month. I think that we should respond to three requirements which advocate including this issue on the agenda for this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is a requirement for timely action. This is actually an issue that directly relates to Community life and which was raised last month, most fortunately, by the Temporary Committee and its rapporteur, Mr Gerhard Schmid. We cannot, therefore, wait until September and for the Temporary Committee’s report to discuss this, as some Members are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">The next requirement is for the truth. In the answers provided by Commissioner Patten and the Temporary Committee’s rapporteur, Mr Schmid, the explanations contradict the statements made by the official involved. We therefore need an explanation and we need it now, not in September.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall mention the requirement for Parliament to maintain its credibility. Mr Lannoye reiterated the point that the media has already latched onto this affair and if we decided not to discuss it when questions are raised and not to give the facts in response, we would, more or less, be seen to be on the defensive and suspected either of wanting to cover something up or of being inconsistent. In order to avoid running this risk, I think that the best thing to do is to include this item on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Normally this Parliament is consulted on a Commission proposal. By derogation from that, under Rule 61, we can deal with a proposal from a Member State government as well. In this particular case, though, Parliament is to deliver an opinion on a position that has been adopted within the Council. It originated with a Member State but we are not giving an opinion on the actual proposal which was put to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not seeking to hold up the Nassauer report but I would ask for the matter to be referred, in future cases, to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs because this is a very important precedent. If, in future, we are going to deal with the changing target of the latest document within the Council instead of the proposal that initiates the legislative procedure, which we then normally seek to amend and where the author can take account of our amendments, we may be going down a slippery slope. This could be unfortunate for the future and I would ask you to invite the Constitutional Affairs Committee to look at that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope that, unlike five minutes ago, this genuine point of order to make sure our Rules are properly applied will not be misinterpreted as a political manoeuvre to keep something on or off the agenda. I am not seeking to remove the Nassauer report from the agenda. Nor was I, just now, seeking to prevent us discussing foot-and-mouth. My concern was to make sure that we respect our Rules of Procedure because they are the foundation of the powers and privileges of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to the fact that this problem does not only concern water management in a Member State, in this case Spain, insofar as everyone knows that a very ambitious hydrological plan is obviously included in the period up to 2008 which clearly contravenes a number of European directives, one of which is the framework directive that we adopted quite recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, Spain is not the only country concerned. Similar projects exist in Italy, France and Portugal. We believe, therefore, that it would be a shame if the European Parliament did not make a clear statement, especially when the European directives, for which we voted, are under threat and are also clearly at risk of being violated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, I have just heard a completely uncalled-for comment which assumes that a Member State’s hydrological plan – which has not yet been implemented, which is at a stage of open planning, and which is still subject to new suggestions and development – violates a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced – and this is also expressed in Commissioner Wallström’s reply to an oral question on this issue – that the Spanish Government’s hydrological plan does not only comply with all aspects of the framework directive, but that it respects it absolutely, and the framework directive will be an essential complement to the successful implementation of our plan. Therefore, because this is entirely an issue involving the management of resources by a Member State, I consider a resolution to be completely unnecessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first question which I would like to put to you is this: why did you not consult this House's Legal Service about your doubts as to the application's legality or notify Parliament of your concerns? In my opinion, the normal procedure in doubtful cases would be to consult this House's Legal Service, which, after all, is available to you in your capacity as President.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you opted instead to consult the Spanish Embassy or Spain's EU representation about your doubts concerning the application's legality. You apparently referred the matter back to Spain's representation. So my second question to you is this: why did you allow more than seven months to elapse without demanding a response to your enquiry? If I have understood the sequence of events correctly, you referred the matter to Spain's permanent representation in August 2000. You apparently delayed until mid-February before requesting a response. That is an awful lot of months! Why did you wait so long, and what, in your view, were the reasons for the delay?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question is this: under the present circumstances, would you now be prepared to involve the relevant committee of this House – in this case, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which deals with the issue of immunity – and transfer the responsibility for this matter to that Committee, or do you intend to retain this competence yourself?</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much. I look forward to your response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – Thank you, Mr Schulz. I shall give clear answers to the three points that you have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to reiterate that, according to the Rules of Procedure, the request must indeed come from the competent authority of a Member State, and the President of the European Parliament decides whether to refer the request to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and announces this decision in Parliament. It is, therefore, the President of the European Parliament who takes the decision and it goes without saying that the President must be confident as to the admissibility of the request.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, I had several reservations, since the President of the Spanish Supreme Court sent this request directly to me and, for several years, all requests to waive parliamentary immunity have been sent by the government of the Member State concerned, with the exception of Portugal, so we are very familiar with the process. The Portuguese Government had actually been persuaded to provide us with confirmation that the legal authority in Portugal did indeed have competence.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain’s case, however, the precedents related to requests from the permanent representation of the Spanish Government and the Spanish Minister for Justice. It is, therefore, obvious that I was running the risk that the decision I might take would be appealed against, regardless of the question of the competence of the authority that sent the request. This is not, then, a legal problem on a European level; it is up to the government rather than the European Parliament, in my view, or its Legal Service, to decide if the legal authority or the government of a country has competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The most obvious solution, all the more so because there were serious reservations, was to contact the government of the country in question, to ask if it could confirm whether the President of the Supreme Court can send this request directly to me, even though there is a precedent where this court had used the intermediary of the government several years ago, and no amendment has been made to Spanish law in the meantime on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second question, the Head of my Private Office wrote with this request at the end of August, and I would like to make it clear that he did so on my instructions, as I myself was on an official visit to Poland. It is not common practice to send a second request to a government of a country if there is no reply. I think, moreover, that after such a long time, there would have been a great deal to say on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it is obvious that there is a problem, since, as you are no doubt aware, I have just received a reply from the Spanish Government to let me know that the issue is very complicated, so complex that it has been referred to the Spanish Council of State to decide, once and for all, which is the competent authority to issue these requests to waive immunity. It would certainly have been unwise for me to take a decision, either on my own or with the Legal Service, as to which is the competent authority.</p>
<p class="contents">You are asking me if I would now refer this matter to the Legal Affairs Committee. In response, I can say very clearly to you, Mr Schulz, that no, I would not. I believe that it would be quite rude, when such a delicate question has been referred to an EU Member’s Council of State and to disregard the fact that this Council of State is looking into this and will come to a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Mr Schulz, I can inform you that as soon as I receive the necessary clarification, as soon as the Council of State has come to a decision, which I hope will be very soon, as soon as the Spanish Government has informed me whether the President of the Supreme Court is competent in this area, and if it appears that he or she is indeed competent, I shall announce in Parliament, as soon as I can, that I am referring the request to waive the immunity of these two Members to the Legal Affairs Committee. That is all the information that I can give to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I clearly recall that the Vice-Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mrs Napoletano, stated, during the Brussels session on 28 February, that this was not a debate for the European Parliament. So first of all, Madam President – and I speak on behalf of the entire Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – I should like to say that you have behaved quite correctly in this matter, and you have the full confidence of our Group. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: Mr Schulz, there has been correspondence between the Chair of your group and the President of the European Parliament. I assume that your contacts with your group Chair are such that you are aware of this correspondence. You also intervened in Brussels, and so the President supplied the necessary answers. In essence, what you are trying to do, two months before the elections in Italy, is to engage in electoral posturing in the European Parliament in order to give a boost to your socialist friends in Italy!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, you were a bad loser in Austria, you and your party friends, and now you are up to the same tricks in Italy. If that is what you want, you can be sure that we here in the European Parliament will be your most determined opponents.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, let me get to the crux of the issue. Instead of interrogating the President for the umpteenth time on this affair, I wish you would put the same questions to your ally Mr Cossuta in Rome, an old-fashioned Stalinist who never fails to support this government in Rome. Why do you not ask him the same questions you are asking here, to the disadvantage of our party friends in Italy? Mr Schulz, I also have information which shows that there is a very wide range of opinion on this issue within your Group. That is quite plausible and entirely natural, but let me tell you that if you do not observe this Parliament's long-standing tradition that no national election campaigns are conducted here, and if you insist on adopting this new approach instead, you will get the proper response from us.</p>

I have been a Member of this Parliament since Spain joined the European Union on 1 January 1986 and, for the first time, this Parliament has established the precedent of a petition from a Supreme Court, not being delivered to the competent committee, but being replied to through the Head of the President’s private office, and the Spanish Ambassador’s letter addressed to the Head of the President’s private office, as if he were a second President. Letters from the Supreme Court are not replied to by the President of Parliament, but by the Head of the President of Parliament’s private office, and the Spanish Ambassador addresses himself to the Head of the President of Parliament’s private office.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue has been referred to the Council of State, where, after being studied, a suitable response will be given to the petition. If I were the Council of State, I would write a letter asking the European Parliament whether the head of the President’s private office is the competent authority to establish what the competent authority is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are several precedents. As you will see, this will actually be very interesting. Mr Barón Crespo wrote to me to request that an exhaustive document be drawn up listing all the requests to waive parliamentary immunity and detailing the reactions given to them. I believe that the House, as well as the Committees that have a particular involvement, will find this document very interesting. It will show, once again, that almost all the requests, except for those from Portugal, originate from governments and that my predecessors were, in several cases, asked to take the same step as myself, that is, to request clarification. In particular, there was the case of Mr Balfe, the British MEP. There have been several instances where you will see that my predecessors Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Klepsch adopted the careful approach that I did. I believe that this really is a very significant issue and it is very important because it affects all the Members of a Parliament whose powers, we must admit, have increased. Members’ protection is a particularly important matter that must be dealt with very carefully, and, I would like to make a serious point that our actions must be completely divorced from our relationships with the Members that these requests for waivers may involve. Personally, this is the way I currently work and shall continue to work in the future, wherever these requests may come from. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful to you for that. We must accept it, but we do not agree with it. Mr Medina has now made this quite clear as well. We will continue to pursue this issue. We will be looking very closely at the reasons why this process has taken so long. It is not only that the stages within the process are incomprehensible; the length of time involved is beyond belief. But I would prefer not to continue this discussion with you during this debate, Madam President. Instead, I should like to say a few words to Mr Poettering. I am quite astonished by his statement.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes! I am quite astonished, because I value him, I value him as a fair partner. But this time, he has astonished me. First of all, it is quite clear that Mr Schulz was speaking on behalf of his group. Mr Schulz spoke and put questions on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and did so with a great deal of courtesy and moderation. Those of us who know Mr Schulz realise that he does not always find it easy to be so moderate and restrained, but he managed it on this occasion, in order to make the points on behalf of the Group in a clear and lucid way.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our full support for Mr Schulz!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Poettering, let me make the following point. I did not speak last time in Brussels. You, however, said something in Brussels which is extremely dangerous. You said that this Group was going against Austria. Do you know who else uses this argument? There is only one person who argues along these lines, and that is Jörg Haider. He always says: “Anyone who criticises the Austrian Government is going against the country.”</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I reject categorically – not only as an Austrian, but also as the present group spokesperson – any implication that anyone criticising the government is going against the country. Our group has never gone against the country or against Austria.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr Poettering, what greatly astonishes me is that, if you had a clear conscience, you really would be pushing hard for a decision to be taken prior to the elections in Italy, without any delay here in Parliament. It was never an issue for our Group or, indeed, for our Italian colleagues who spoke out against it. Mrs Napoletano did not say that we are against a discussion of this issue. She was merely critical of the way in which the discussion was being conducted, namely on a party-political basis. Our Italian friends have absolutely no interest in politicising this matter. What we cannot accept is that the timeframe is so long. And if you, Mr Poettering, in particular, are genuinely interested in ensuring that a decision is taken, you must also be interested in ensuring that the decision is taken in the European Parliament now, regardless of the Italian elections. Otherwise, there will be suspicions that you know it could be dangerous for Berlusconi, and are doing your utmost to postpone the decision until after the elections. And you could only quash these suspicions, Mr Poettering, if you were in favour of a speedy decision by this House!</p>

Madam President, with your answers, you have provided a most welcome contrast to Mr Poettering this afternoon. You have responded to my questions objectively and in a very focused way. I have been in politics long enough to know that if you ask the President a question and a group Chairman intervenes excitedly, you are on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, Madam President, I should like, with your permission, to ask you again to answer my questions to which you have not yet responded. I put three questions to you in all. Firstly, I asked how you explain the fact that such a sensitive matter could be left lying for so long by the Spanish authorities without being dealt with. After all, Madam President, you sent an enquiry to the Spanish authorities, and they very discourteously made you wait for months for a response. What were the reasons for this delay, in your view, and why did you not demand a reply?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask you to answer the following questions. Are you absolutely certain that the Berlusconi/Dell'Utri case is unique? In other words, is it the only case in which the Spanish Supreme Court has sent an application direct to the European Parliament? Is this the first time this has happened? Can you definitely rule out any possibility that similar cases have arisen in the past, when the Spanish Supreme Court has approached Parliament direct and Parliament has immediately initiated its usual procedure? So my precise question is this: has there previously been a case like this one – which has given rise to doubt in your mind – where the Supreme Court has contacted the President of this House direct, and has Parliament accepted this procedure on a previous occasion? I would ask you to answer this question for me, because this has nothing to do with the Italian election campaign. Instead, my intention is to ensure that every Member of this House is treated equally, regardless of whether they are called Dell'Utri, Berlusconi, Poettering or Schulz. That is the reason for my questions, nothing else!</p>

It gives me the opportunity to tell you that, personally, there is only one aspect of this matter that is not clear to me; and that is the reason why the President of the Supreme Court did not use the intermediary of the permanent representative of the Spanish Government to send us his request, as he had done so several years before. I must say that I did wonder about this. You will say that this matter is not my concern and I should not have reservations – this would have been perfectly straightforward. If that were the case, we could have, in fact, saved at least forty-five minutes this afternoon and we would not be debating this issue now. Yet, you are asking me why the Spanish Government has taken so much time to give me a reply. Well, I can imagine and, in fact, I can see today that it is because there is a genuine problem with regard to competence – it could be called a conflict of competence…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mr Schulz asked the President a question to which she replied)</span></p>
<p class="contents">…sent by the Minister for Justice and the Spanish permanent representative via the government. It is very simple. I repeat, the document that you will receive and which, I hope, will be very detailed, is actually extremely interesting and will give you details of the solutions found for all the situations which have arisen in various countries and the competent authority will always be noted.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that it is possible Mr Schulz. I am sorry but you are overstepping the mark a little, and I have been very patient. I am willing to meet to discuss this with you, if you wish, just as I am willing to see any Member of the House who requests a meeting.

At such a time, I appeal to the executive authority of the Union and to this Parliament to take whatever steps are necessary to help improve the living and working conditions in the fishing industry so that we can, as far as possible, avoid this type of accident which, these days, particularly afflicts the seamen of Galicia.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the meantime, 57 people have been arrested. The conflict in the Basque country bears some resemblance to that in Northern Ireland. Despite many differences, I can say that Basque nationalists have tried to follow the Irish model. The Spanish and French Governments unfortunately have not. They hold the view that the only possible position on armed struggle and the underlying nationalism is to wipe them out.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the paths taken in London and Dublin become the main model for Madrid and Paris it seems that the political landscape will remain as it is. You, Madam President, will continue to back the Spanish strategy, and I will continue to say what my Spanish colleagues dislike most. That is a very sad reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you can see, terrorism is indiscriminate and also strikes at democratic nationalists.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as expressing my condolences and solidarity with the family and friends of the late Iñaki, I would like, once again, to express, in this parliamentary forum of the European Union, our complete condemnation of this latest attack and of all the murders and violent acts which the terrorist organisation ETA has being carrying out with a view to imposing its ideas through terror.</p>
<p class="contents">ETA claims to defend working people and to support a process of sovereignty and peace for the Basque people, and I would ask ETA whether murdering local councillors, cooks, workers and Basque policemen, kidnapping, extorting and assaulting people constitutes their peace plan. How can anyone believe in a plan that does not respect human rights, and that does not even respect the right to life?</p>
<p class="contents">The Basque Country, which I come from, wants peace above all, and that peace can only be achieved through mutual democratic respect. Therefore, on the journey towards finding this much longed for peace, ETA’s actions and any other type of violence have no place, are unwanted and neither help nor protect anyone, and the best thing would be for them to disappear once and for all and forever, so that we can move on to a phase of free political debate and free democratic decision making by all Basque citizens without exception so that we can decide on the best political future for our people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Gorostiaga has reminded us that the Spanish democratic justice system has in recent days made a series of arrests. Those arrested have been people accused of very serious crimes, of collaborating with armed groups, of apologising for terrorism and of supporting organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">These people, who have been arrested on the orders of an independent and democratic judge, will have every judicial safeguard, they will be defended and heard, they will have a fair trial and, at all times, their dignity as people and citizens will be respected, which is not the case with the victims of Mr Gorostiaga’s friends, who are silenced by a bullet or a bomb, and who are, of course, unable to express themselves freely from the graveyards they are sent to by Mr Gorostiaga’s associates.</p>
<p class="contents">Very soon the Basque Country will have the opportunity to speak freely through the ballot box and then Mr Gorostiaga will see the results of the horror he brings to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, just as Mr Gorostiaga’s speeches are a disgrace to this House, the abominations practised by his ETA friends and represented by him are a disgrace to humanity.</p>

<p class="contents">On 7 March, in the middle of the night, 33 Palestinian villages – between Ramal and Birzeit, where there is a university – were completely sealed off by Israeli soldiers, who went so far as to use tanks and who dug trenches and destroyed 400 metres of paved land; 65 000 people are enclosed in those places. These are actions which, in my opinion, we can in no way endorse. I, therefore, call upon the President to make representations to Mr Solana and to present a protest at the way the University of Birzeit has been completely closed off. The students and teachers of Birzeit had not opened fire, nor had they taken any other hostile initiative: they were there simply to study.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has reached dramatic proportions. Israel cannot continue to violate the Geneva International Conventions and collective punishment is wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not endorse military or terrorist acts carried out by individual Palestinians or organisations, but collective punishment must be opposed because it is a form of tribal vendetta rather than a reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the President to champion a protest to the Israeli government and to ask Mr Solana to authorise an immediate intervention to bring about the reopening of the occupied territories and put an end to the collective punishments inflicted on the Palestinian people, and to bring about the reopening of Birzeit and its university and the restoration of this people's right to education and life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
