As I said last night when I saw him, I come from the European Defence Agency where they, too, would wish me to express their thanks for the work that he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no debate about the common security and defence policy (CSDP) this year that can ignore the financial crisis which has led to a wave of defence cuts across the European Union. This has resulted in both the increased focus on pooling and sharing of military capabilities and in the current staff shortfalls we are experiencing in important CSDP missions and operations.</p>
<p class="contents">But the demand for the EU to do more and better is getting stronger. We need to be able to respond to the complex threats of today – crises from cyber-threats, energy security and others – and we need to assume our global responsibilities whilst showing real value for money. To deliver value for money, we need CSDP action to be based on coherent and effective strategies and a truly comprehensive approach and equipped with the right capabilities, as was restated in the Foreign Affairs Council on 1 December.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary constraints force us to save, but they are also a driver of closer collaboration; whether on pooling and sharing of defence assets, joint programming of development aid, or solidarity in the evacuation of European nationals from scenes of conflict or disaster. The message is clear: doing better with less.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1 December Foreign Affairs Council endorsed my call to maximise synergies and strengthen cooperation – complementing instead of duplicating each other. I am committed to ensuring that the actions by the External Action Service, the Commission and the EU Member States reinforce rather than compete with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting of 1 December, we also agreed that the EU needs to improve its operations by more clearly identifying needs and acting with clear objectives and clear exit strategies. The European Parliament, alongside national parliaments and governments, plays an important role in ensuring the democratic oversight of EU foreign, security and defence policy, as recognised in my declaration on political accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus for a moment on some important achievements during the course of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">At the level of structures, we have established the External Action Service and it is now equipped to deal with crises better, faster and smarter. When the Service was launched in January 2011, the Arab Spring required our immediate response. In light of this experience, we have set up the Crisis Management Board and Crisis Platform, which also dealt effectively with crisis situations in Ivory Coast, Libya and the Horn of Africa. These structures are central to our capacity to respond, and maintain their direct reporting line to me while working closely with the rest of the service.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also improved the early warning capacity through the Situation Room and the Conflict Prevention Group and we are currently exploring how to strengthen the security policy expertise in EU delegations. All of this has been achieved using and restructuring the existing resources and improving their flexibility and efficiency rather than by seeking other expensive and complex solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are turning a comprehensive approach into comprehensive action and I believe the External Action Service is uniquely placed for this. We can join up all of the instruments of the European Union and cover conflict prevention, development and conflict resolution. We are putting this to full use in the Horn of Africa and in the Southern Neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people try and say that we are facing some sort of fatigue on CSDP, yet this year has been a year of intensive work on this area, with concrete results, and ending with comprehensive and, I believe, forward-looking Council conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">On military capabilities, the 30 November European Defence Agency Steering Board delivered concrete Member States’ commitments in specific projects, including in areas where the Libya crisis showed our shortfalls. This is a good first step towards more substantial achievements next spring, also in view of the NATO Chicago summit which I will attend.</p>
<p class="contents">But as indicated by the honourable Member Mr Lisek’s report, there is no alternative to cooperation in this area. Multinational cooperation must become the rule rather than the exception in order to preserve and develop Europe’s defence capabilities. I agree with what Mr Lisek says: pooling and sharing is a means of delivering enhanced capabilities and of offsetting defence budgets cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Head of the European Defence Agency, I will continue to make every effort to facilitate cooperation among and between Member States and to increase the global competitiveness and efficiency of the European defence industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, I presented a comprehensive report on CSDP. It set out the parameters for further work, both in terms of hardware – our military and civilian capabilities – and software – how we plan and conduct operations and engage with our partners. The Foreign Affairs Council on 1 December welcomed my work to strengthen the CSDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States’ initiatives, such as the Weimar initiative and subsequent contributions, have provided an added impetus to work. I am pleased, too, that we found a pragmatic way forward on the issue of the planning and conduct of CSDP operations. We are now beginning planning for the activation of the operations centre for the Horn of Africa operations by the next Foreign Affairs Council in January. This will allow us to test this tool, with a view to strengthening civilian-military synergies and again to draw lessons for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have achieved a lot of progress in working with our partners. In the area of security and defence, the relationship with NATO is essential. It is recognised in the Lisbon Treaty, which is the first of the EU Treaties to explicitly refer to NATO. The breadth of EU instruments can be usefully combined with the depth of NATO’s role on defence. The two organisations can and should reinforce each other’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">I have worked hard to establish a good, close working relationship with NATO Secretary-General Rasmussen, to bring the EU and NATO closer through a pragmatic step-by-step approach, while maintaining the overall objective of a true organisation-to-organisation relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">The Libya crisis again showed a clear need for this. We work hand in hand in many theatres, and we owe it to our people in the field. I am also pleased to confirm that on capabilities in particular – whether labelled pooling and sharing or smart defence – we have now achieved an unprecedented level of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN remains, of course, a longstanding partner, and we are turning this partnership into reality: in theatres where both are or could be engaged, in Afghanistan, Somalia, Kosovo and Libya, and through our strategic dialogue. I have also personally engaged on security and defence with our strategic partners, not least regarding areas like the Horn of Africa or in Libya. I signed a framework agreement with the United States of America in June on their participation in CSDP civilian missions and already 60 US citizens under EU chain of command are operating in Kosovo and Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to foster closer cooperation with other partner countries, including contributors and the neighbours to the south and to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end my remarks with the possible way forward. I think we have to further operationalise the comprehensive approach, by better linking our conflict prevention, mediation, development and conflict resolution activities. CSDP has a vital role to play in addressing forms of organised crime, such as trafficking of drugs, of weapons and, of course, of people. These are directly linked to conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the security threats in the Sahel also relate to the influx of weapons and militias as a result of changes in Libya. On this, the combination of all of the European Union’s tools in a coherent strategy is absolutely essential. We have to pay constant attention to force generation and capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council undertook to make every effort to address this challenge and I will examine innovative ways to improve force generation in order to make proposals in the first half of 2012. Force generation, by the way, means getting the right people in the right place.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on military capabilities should continue towards a systematic pooling and sharing, not only as an answer to financial constraints, but also as means of enhanced operational effectiveness in the long term. We also have to enhance the effectiveness of missions and operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should act through CSDP missions and operations to add value, on the basis of identified needs, with clear objectives and exit strategies to deliver and sustain results. As long as we can deliver on the existing missions, I am always ready to take forward work on possible new missions – in particular, in regions of such strategic importance to Europe’s security such as the Sahel and Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">The common security and defence policy can only be as effective and ambitious as we let it be. It relies on collective political will and ambition to act. It also means that the CFSP budget should be able to respond to the financial aspects of force generation. The European Parliament’s support in the last months has been essential on this, and I would like to take this opportunity to express to all of you my gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close by thanking you for your support on the work on CSDP, to reconfirm my continued commitment to CSDP as an integral and indispensable part of the European Union’s external action and, as I began, to once again thank Mr Lisek for his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Krzysztof Lisek, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the pleasant and warm words on the report. I would simply like to say that this report is, of course, the result of joint efforts. It is the fruit not only of my work, but also of the work of many members of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and of the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I cooperated very well. I wish to take this opportunity to thank them all from the floor of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome what Baroness Ashton has said, and I am glad that you, Baroness, the representatives of the Member States and the representatives of the Council all show a strong understanding of the problem, the needs, and of everything that relates to the common security and defence policy at the present time. This policy still represents a major challenge for us. I think that both you, Baroness, and the Council recognise that in the European Parliament, in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, there is strong support for actions to promote joint work, joint activities by the Member States, activities aimed at increasing our efficiency in the field of security and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">All of you, I hope, are familiar with the statement by the US Secretary of Defence, Robert Gates, about our capabilities in the field of security and defence. This statement was initially met with much criticism, but that criticism was made only at the outset. Subsequently, it turned out that many European politicians, including many officials at the European institutions stated that alas, the US Secretary of Defence was largely right. We face a great challenge, regarding both reform of the common security and defence policy and, of course, good cooperation between the European Union and NATO. In particular, the European Union should focus on the search for synergies that allow its Member States to optimise their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial crisis, which is currently a major issue for Europe, is a global phenomenon and, of course, it also affects the defence sector. There is a tendency to reduce defence spending in the Member States, which is obviously a concern for us. It is true that maintaining defence spending in times of crisis, when faced with social needs, is not an easy task for those in authority and for politicians, but we believe – and I personally believe – that security and defence must not be ignored even in such a turbulent and difficult period for European finances.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, I present several ways to optimise spending, suggesting how the means at our disposal, albeit slightly less than we had available before, could be spent in a better way, more appropriately, more effectively. Of course, what Baroness Ashton said is also true: the idea of ‘pooling and sharing’, connecting and sharing out functions has now become a necessity. This will make cost reductions possible. We must identify the most promising, strategic projects in this area, as soon as we can. They should definitely include strategic transport, logistical support, medical assistance, education, mid-air refuelling, maritime surveillance, protection and measures in cases of emergency arising from the use of chemical, biological and radiological weapons, satellite communications and intelligence. There are many fields where this idea of ‘pooling and sharing’ may be implemented effectively. The role of the European Defence Agency is inestimable in this context. It will determine how we can coordinate defence planning in Europe in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue I have dealt with is technological development. Here, too, we have identified many shortcomings. The report also addresses the question of defence equipment procurement, tenders, and many other issues. All these matters require thought and I am very glad that Baroness Ashton agrees that we should simply get down to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very likely that, due to the financial crisis and the associated budget reductions, there will be programme cuts that have a negative effect on the defence industry. The absence of a common policy in this area may further exacerbate the negative impacts on the defence industry. A common arms policy may make sense from an economic perspective, but it may also threaten the sovereignty of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, a European defence policy should lead to greater multilateral cooperation, while also taking account of the national characteristics of the defence industry. More specifically, in order to mitigate the impact of the financial crisis on the defence industry, it is necessary to consider greater consolidation of demand through joint research projects or through bundling of demand for shared capabilities. Exporting helps some firms to mitigate the impacts of the financial crisis, including firms that are not competitive internationally. These firms should continue to diversify their portfolios, perhaps into the area of civil security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For us, foreign policy obviously always means taking preventive measures in order to make military intervention unnecessary. That is the starting position for our policy. However, military forces are necessary for peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Where military forces are needed, we must deploy them sensibly and make the best possible use of the instruments available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly makes it clear that we are not using our resources responsibly. When budgets are tight, we must ensure that we exploit synergies and this can only be done at a European level. Therefore, it is right that the report calls for a White Paper which, on the one hand, will define the objectives and interests of the European Union and, on the other, will link them with the means and resources available. In areas such as procurement, research and development, for example, we can achieve much more jointly than if each country were to develop and buy its own cartridges. The question of the European Defence Agency in particular is of crucial importance if we are to make any progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we can make more use of the multinational organisations of which there is an increasing number within the European Union and that we should evaluate our operational readiness and the legal problems relating to it. I think that joint efforts in this area will also help to protect our soldiers. In the case of Afghanistan, it is clear that each country is going in with different reservations and that there is no sensible cooperation. In addition, there is no possibility of implementing the Berlin Plus agreement with collaboration between NATO and the civil crisis management bodies of the European Union. There is a great deal of work to be done in the interests of our citizens, of people who want to stand up for freedom, and of our soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, you have rightly said that in order to achieve this, we need collective political will. This will have to develop gradually in some capital cities as a result of the limited budget funding available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as we are concerned, there are two basic issues: firstly, we need to ensure that synergies and cooperation are strengthened at European level, in order to prevent resources from being wasted and, secondly, we need to safeguard jobs in the defence sector. The current situation calls for smart coordination, in order to lay the foundations for an internationally competitive industry which can create prospects for new jobs in the defence sector. Unfortunately, the restructuring of the defence industry is inevitable. What we need to ensure is that it is done with as few consequences as possible on employment. In the final analysis, European solidarity, specialisation, interoperability and complementarity are, in our view, the guidelines for a progressive policy in the defence sector and an answer to the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to welcome this substantive report which not only examines the subject, but also attempts to offer solutions and which, apart from all this, provides opportunities for achieving a cohesive security and defence policy. To paraphrase Al Gore, we now have the chance to turn this crisis into an opportunity for the defence industry and for the future of our common security and defence policy. However, I cannot but stress that this drastic decline in Member States’ defence budgets may pose a risk to our common security, may maintain the still considerable disparities between the United States and the NATO member countries in the European Union, and may make the EU vulnerable in terms of its reaction capability.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the instruments that we already have, by this I mean the European Defence Agency, must be used in a purposeful manner. We must increase its reaction capability and integration ability for this pooling and sharing policy, which is the only solution enabling Europe to have a common capability, not to lose the capability it has, to ensure its interoperability in the common defence system, and to be effective in the missions which it has and which, unfortunately, will probably continue.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this, I believe that Europe is obliged to develop a common technological and industrial base for itself, use its research capability which some Member States have, and continue to favour solutions promoting honest conduct in public procurement, because one of the factors which have made these budgets vulnerable is the issues arising from corruption in the defence procurement system.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have a code of conduct, but we will have to use this code of conduct much more effectively. When we successfully make a procurement, we will do it on the grounds of being an opportunity promoting the interests of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lisek is taking up the opportunity of the concept of pooling and sharing. I am pleased that he is attempting, by means of a few small amendments, to increase the pressure on the Member States slightly, but in a very polite way.</p>
<p class="contents">If that were the main content of the report, my group would be voting in favour of it tomorrow. However, there are also two negative points. On the one hand, an attempt is being made in the light of the shortage of money in the Member States to cannibalise the EU budget for defence spending. This cannot be right. It is not right to finance defence research via the EU budget as part of the Horizon 2020 programme or the Seventh Framework Programme. It is not right to finance the Defence College via the EU, to open up the Structural Funds to the defence industry, or to fund a military Erasmus Programme out of our budget. This is a distraction from the actual task in hand, which is to ensure that we combine efficiency and cost cutting.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I find it particularly strange that the initiative has been led by Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who are normally very much in favour of competition. This report attempts to undermine completely our achievements in the Defence Package with regard to transparency and competition in the process of tendering for defence equipment by claiming that the intention is to protect jobs. I can only ask you not to give in to this. We are tabling amendments for individual votes on specific paragraphs. This should not be included in this report because it is structurally conservative, promotes inefficiency and wastes money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, he draws the wrong conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that the answer to every problem in this House is more Europe. It is all about European integration. Our concern here instead should be more military capability and greater solidarity in NATO. That means serious operational commitment and political will, two elements sadly lacking in so many European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that the very real threats and challenges that we face will not be resolved by trying to apply the same procedures to defence as we have seen applied to the euro. The European Union should stop meddling in defence. Its ambition is a dangerous, wasteful distraction. The Libyan crisis should have provided more than enough evidence that CSDP was irrelevant. No one wanted an EU military involvement – neither the United Nations, nor indeed NATO – and the Libyan experience revealed very starkly the potential dangers of the pooling and sharing concept, which seemed so attractive to EU policy makers.</p>
<p class="contents">Germany even withdrew its crews from NATO surveillance aircraft, the AWACS, operating over Libya. What sort of example is that? Of the 28 countries who agreed NATO operations over Libya, less than half actually participated and fewer than a third were willing to participate in strike missions. How could you expect a country such as the United Kingdom, or indeed France, to rely on someone else to provide a vital military capability on our behalf?</p>

This is indeed all happening in NATO so why is the European Union trying to do things? Why is the European Union trying to replicate NATO? Why is it setting up institutions which merely duplicate those which already exist at NATO? The great merit of NATO, however, is that it is an intergovernmental alliance, and sovereign nations can choose whether or not they participate in particular operations. That is the great difference.</p>
<p class="contents">And we do not have pooling and sharing; we have common command arrangements when there are NATO operations. There are very limited pooling and sharing capabilities, and I have mentioned one of them and that is the AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System). We saw what happened to the AWACS in the Libyan crisis, so we have to be extremely careful about this.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need are solid, reliable allies. When the going gets tough, they have got to turn out, even when it is politically difficult.

If we are to make savings in Europe, then we should cut our defence spending. Defence means defence against territorial attacks, so it is good that we can say: Yes, we can make savings in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, even if I were to accept the prevailing logic and to assume that our defence requirements are at a very high level, it seems to me that the aim here is to reach a higher level of military capability under the guise of pressure on costs and to give the defence industry a better and more reliable source of income. I think that the scenario of a defence capability under threat is being exaggerated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention here that it is not true that cuts in defence spending will lead to a rise in unemployment. That is simply not the case. However, high levels of defence spending do not only involve huge sums of money which are needed elsewhere. The proposals in Mr Lisek’s report also mean putting democracy at risk, for example, by means of the ATHENA mechanism, which is not subject to democratic controls, or by combining civilian and military capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be voting against this report. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, have tabled a minority opinion, which calls, among other things, for radical disarmament and a purely civilian EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It responds to the specific strategic, diplomatic and security needs of each nation. Sharing capabilities is nothing more than a drastic loss of sovereignty, the single market of military equipment a joke, when certain Member States stock up on mainly US equipment, believing their defence is guaranteed by Washington, while Europe is incapable of imposing Community preference in this area as in so many others.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the EU Member States’ common security challenges, there is nothing that cannot be resolved through intergovernmental cooperation, without any intervention from Brussels. I am sorry, but entrusting these areas to Baroness Ashton would mean recognising that Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poors are legitimate in judging our economic policies; it would mean accepting that ‘Merkozy’ can impose a German Europe on 27 peoples, which is absolutely delusional.</p>
<p class="contents">For 30 years and more since the disappearance of the Soviet threat, defence budgets have been the first to be sacrificed on the altar of budgetary restraint, to the point where most of our military tools have become deficient or dilapidated, all in the name of purely financial considerations, with each country waiting for its neighbour or supposed US big brother to make the efforts it is no longer prepared to make itself. However, you are making a mistake. Only by returning to independent and resolute national policies will we be able to individually equip ourselves with the necessary resources, not only to ensure our national interest and security, but also to cooperate in the use of those resources so as to overcome common challenges.</p>

<p class="contents">European countries will also be affected by another strategic constraint: the attitude of our US friends and allies, who are no longer willing or able to do everything for us where security is concerned. The Libyan case illustrated this point well.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in this very restrictive context, we must revive the ambition for a common security and defence policy which is strong on operations and capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of operations, Baroness Ashton, you talk at length – and rightly so – about this famous comprehensive approach that undoubtedly only the European Union has the power to promote in terms of the main international crises. We still need to ensure – and this is your role – that this comprehensive approach does not sacrifice security elements and, where appropriate, military elements. It must be truly comprehensive, without watering down this security aspect. That is the positive message you have given us through the Sahel and Horn of Africa strategies, and I welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of capabilities, we must, of course, welcome the European Defence Agency’s role, even if there are unfortunately still some restrictions on its budget. I would be grateful if you could make your assessment of the European Defence Agency’s efforts known.</p>
<p class="contents">When talking about the defence industry, we must also remember that strengthening and supporting our European defence industries – obviously without forgetting to rationalise them – also supports jobs and technologies that extend far beyond the defence sector alone and which are of huge strategic importance to our economies, particularly during times of crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">High Representative, I want to focus on a fairly narrow point that you mentioned in your opening remarks. That was on the signing of the framework with the United States on civilian missions in Kosovo and Afghanistan and the number of people who are currently working on these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We all should welcome the expertise that many of these people bring and their bravery in difficult and dangerous circumstances. I think especially of the pioneering role of former members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in Iraq in training the new police force and in working with civilians to ensure the capacity to preserve peace and democracy following the withdrawal of British and American troops in that country. At times, this was both a lonely, dangerous and indeed complex job. It was, however, a job made more difficult and more complicated by European bureaucracy and I would ask for your assurances that the people who now serve in Afghanistan and Kosovo will not be obstructed in the same way by bureaucrats in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton has rightly said that the common security and defence policy can only be as effective as we let it be. She is right about that. I would have liked to have seen the Council conclusions on 1 December allowing it to be more effective, for example, in the area of planning and management capability. We have just about been able to agree that the operations centre in Brussels can be used on an ad hoc basis, but not systematically or permanently, and I find that regrettable. I would also like to know how it can be that there is a commitment to battle groups in the Council conclusions, but that the Member States are unable to put together two battle groups in the first half of 2012. Why is this? How can this be prevented from happening in future?</p>
<p class="contents">The pooling and sharing initiative has also been mentioned by many speakers. In my opinion, it is excellent and should not just be used as an emergency measure, because our finances are so stretched, but because it will genuinely bring us closer together. However, I would like to know to what extent the Ghent initiative and the pooling and sharing initiative have really resulted in the gaps in our capabilities, which were highlighted in the Defence Industrial Headline Goal 2010, being closed. I would also like to know when we will finally put into practice the permanent structured cooperation, as called for in the letter from the Weimar Triangle plus, in other words the five countries, dated September 2011. What steps is the European External Action Service taking to support the implementation of the permanent structured cooperation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the envisaged rigorous fiscal and budgetary discipline calls for continuing downsizing of our defence budgets while security challenges continue to accumulate, including in our immediate neighbourhood. Even if neither of those challenges is yet a threat, their accumulation, if unattended, might confront us with a dangerous and threatening mix in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, Europe is increasingly forced to sell its assets, and not always to a friendly buyer. Again, if this is not attended to, we might end up with strategic European assets in the wrong hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the effort to save the euro has already undermined the EU’s internal solidarity. With decision making concentrated in the hands of the euro countries, suspicion and even recrimination have crept to the surface, potentially undermining our pooling and sharing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, at a time when the US is diminishing its contribution to NATO and talk about a smaller alliance has already been initiated across the Atlantic, Europe’s credibility – as both global actor and security provider – suffers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is holding a conversation at the back and we are pleased to see him. He is not listening, because he does not understand German, but that does not matter.</p>
<p class="contents">When I attend events in my constituency, I always ask my constituents: Which has more soldiers, the European Union or the United States? People generally give the wrong answer. The Member States of the European Union have 2 million soldiers under arms, while the United States has 1.4 million. We are armed to the teeth, but we are only spending on these soldiers one-third of what the Americans are spending. That is plainly nonsense. For this reason, pooling and sharing makes perfect sense. However, it is also clear that we cannot leave this to the armed forces alone. The process must be under political control. In this respect, this report makes a major contribution to the political debate and I would like to thank Mr Lisek.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to express my criticism of one point and that concerns offsets. The opinion expressed in this report cannot replace the legally binding provisions of the directive on defence procurement in the European Union. I have read the Commission’s guidelines on the use of offsets and it is essential that we follow them. Regardless of whether they are civilian or military, direct or indirect, they always have the effect of distorting competition and, under the terms of Article 346, are only permitted in very few exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I believe it is important for us to emphasise this once again, to stick to it and to vote accordingly.</p>

It also requires two Member States, Britain and France, to be persuaded to cease wasting money on their nuclear arsenals, which do not serve to counter any of the threats Europe and the world are now facing: just the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to Baroness Ashton that Libya was a glaring missed opportunity for a CSDP mission and therefore for EU, and not Franco-British, leadership. Your job is indeed to persuade Member States not to miss these opportunities and to assume these responsibilities. We in this Parliament will definitely support you in these endeavours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as this Parliament is concerned, I believe that, in general, the second option is preferable by far, primarily because it offers the only way in which we can play a significant role in a globalised world.</p>
<p class="contents">China’s defence budget, which Ms Gomes also mentioned earlier, has grown by almost 200% in the last 10 years. During this time, EU Member States are about to cut all their expenditure in this sector. This is why the only logical solution is better coordination of defence planning and pooling and sharing our capabilities. Our intervention in Libya has clearly shown us why we need to do this. In addition to our involvement in NATO, I believe that the time has come for us to build a real European defence capability.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which we are voting on suggests specific steps for achieving this objective, and I would like to highlight three of these steps:</p>
<p class="contents">1. creating a European Semester for security and defence reviews;</p>
<p class="contents">2. strengthening the ‘Security’ section in the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development;</p>
<p class="contents">3. devising a ‘military’ Erasmus programme facilitating the development of a common security culture and approach.</p>

<p class="contents">The economic and financial crisis may constitute a challenge and, at the same time, an opportunity to integrate the defence policies of the European Union, given that they can encourage the Member States to apply necessary and important reforms in the defence and security sector. It is perfectly comprehensible and we support and back the pooling and sharing policy as things stand. However, due to the military occupation of Cyprus and the continuing presence of Turkish troops on the island, the Republic of Cyprus cannot implement the recommendations in the report to the degree that it would like to do, especially in the pooling and sharing sector. Cyprus is forced to continue to focus all its efforts on territorial defence-based action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not even the question of reductions in defence expenditure. Even more alarming is the way the money is being used. National defence planning continues to be very uncoordinated, which results in capacity gaps, over-capacities and duplications. Defence research and technology has a totally insufficient share of our spending.</p>
<p class="contents">But the message of this report is that the financial crisis also provides opportunities. It is time to end the tradition of isolation in national defence planning and I absolutely agree with the High Representative, who said that multinational cooperation pooling and sharing should become a rule rather than the exception in our activities.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would also like to talk about cyber defence. This is an area which is in need of a decisive breakthrough in established nation-centred models of thinking. More efficient cooperation and qualitatively better coordination are the key requirements, and these are not just good wishes, because the ominous potential of cyber threats is still developing ahead of our preventive and defensive measures. Our task is to build more joint cyber-defence exercises and burden sharing on cyber incident analysis and, of course, we need also in Europe a cyber defence coordinator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone, even the Member States facing extensive specific and inelastic national security requirements, such as Greece on its eastern borders, are seeking realistic and effective solutions based on a lower cost/higher performance approach. Under these difficult circumstances, the truth is that there are not many options. Thus, more extensive and fundamental European defence cooperation is a one-way street. However, it is an uphill one-way street.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of cooperation and synergies is not a simple endeavour, because defence policy forms part of the hard core of the national sovereignty of states. That is why we also need to work with decisiveness and flexibility and why we must support the pooling and sharing approach. At the same time, of course, interoperability, complementarity and, of course, rationalisation of defence spending are particularly important. In Greece, we are trying to achieve this but, believe me, it is very difficult, because we face a real threat.

The UK forces owe on oath of allegiance to Her Majesty and her government, not the EU. As already stated by fellow UK colleagues, NATO is already in place and, as seen in Libya, is effective. If you cannot get unanimity on the euro, how on earth can you do so on complicated security issues?</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I have a real problem with, Baroness Ashton, is your part in this. As a former treasurer of CND, you are talking about security policy with nations that have nuclear weapons. How on earth can you provide an objective view on this? There was a colleague in this Chamber who mentioned a nuclear-free Europe. That must have been music to your ears. You are not competent for this position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Defence budgets are too small at the moment, which means that cooperation is the best way to ensure our military capabilities. For instance, simulators can be used in rotation. We can also buy jointly a much larger number of F-16 aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have two examples of the way in which NATO Member States share their capabilities: military transport aircraft, whereby each country pays for a certain number of flights through leasing, and maritime cooperation between France and the UK, with one providing ports and the other ships.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Air Transport Command initiative is a particularly useful example where the use of existing capabilities is optimised by transferring some competences to a common structure. We must adapt this model to other areas of operational support as well, such as transport helicopters, maritime patrol aircraft and military sealift assets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As European GDPs fall, the percentage of spending on defence naturally falls as well, and will continue to fall. We had better get used to that. The economic and financial cuts added to this are pushing Europe into a defence ‘trap’ where we will be unable to meet our present and future commitments should we not do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual nations are not in an industrial position to work alone. Procurement, technology, new innovation: these approaches need, by their very nature, to be shared, pooled and made available for all. Given Europe’s special status as a continent split asunder by war over hundreds of years, we have a responsibility to maintain some coordination of our common security.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, the view that I have heard from some speakers, like Mr van Orden, that NATO is the end of it, is simply wrong. I cannot see that his point about bureaucrats has anything to do with it. He was after all, as a staff officer himself, involved in Brussels in much of the bureaucracy in the decision making in NATO and the Commission. Or so I understand – unless your Wikipedia page is wrong. But perhaps you need to correct that before you start criticising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone for all their remarks concerning the report, both positive and negative. ‘Nobody is perfect’, as they said in a well-known film. If we were to collect all the remarks which you, ladies and gentlemen, have submitted, we could embark on writing another report.</p>
<p class="contents">So many issues, interesting and important from the point of view of Europe’s defence, have been addressed. I do realise that my report will not resolve all the problems. My intention was only to draw attention to the important issues relating to the financial crisis, to look at the financial crisis in the defence sector from a new perspective, whilst highlighting not only the risks but also new opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that a decisive majority of you, ladies and gentlemen, supported the main points of my report. I think we all agree that security should not be neglected. Many journalists or colleagues from this House have asked me who exactly this report is addressed to, who exactly should be considering all the points made. I believe that it is not actually addressed to the High Representative, and I would like to apologise to her for saying this, since Baroness Ashton has supported most of our points. The report is addressed, first and foremost, to the Member States, to the governments and to the parliaments of the EU Member States. Accordingly, if the report is adopted tomorrow, it is with these governments and parliaments of the EU Member States that we should now engage in dialogue on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, this has been an interesting – and I think very important – debate, not least because, in the context of looking at the economic situation that Member States and institutions find themselves in, it is absolutely vital that we discuss how best to make sure that we are able to respond to some of the crises and security threats that we are faced with as individual nations, as parliamentarians and as institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that anyone in this House will be surprised to know that this forms part of the discussions that I have on a regular basis with Secretary-General Rasmussen and when I take part in NATO meetings, at their request, both in Foreign Minister and Defence Minister formation. It is really vital that we understand what it is we want to try to achieve and how best to go about it. It is worth remembering the kind of missions that our people are currently engaged in and how those missions work effectively with others that are also operating in the field, not least NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind honourable Members that we have monitoring missions operating in Georgia as a result of the crisis that Georgia faced when Russia behaved as it did in August 2008. We still have people now who are helping to make sure that there is confidence built on the borders and making sure that people are able to go about their business in an ordinary way.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of people have talked about the Horn of Africa and the incredible work that the Atalanta Mission does, made up of different Member States which very willingly bring together their expertise, their ships and their helicopters, led by the British in Northwood – very effectively by Admiral Potts currently serving in command from Northwood – and actually playing a vital role in ensuring that the World Food Programme can deliver food to people who are literally starving, and helping to support countries which are grappling with how to tackle piracy off their coasts, the threat that poses for individuals, the threat of hostage taking and hijacking, and the threat for those who rely on tourism. These are really important issues where the European Union has a contribution to make, not trying to do what NATO does but doing things with NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the best example to illustrate this is what is happening currently in Kosovo, with EULEX Kosovo providing what is called the second response line: police officers willing to go in to try to stop the kind of violence that we have witnessed recently in the north of Kosovo, working hand in hand with KFOR, with the NATO forces which are there as the third response unit. This is an international operation because the dangers and difficulties of what has happened between Serbia and Kosovo required us all to provide an international response. Member States freely and willingly want to engage together in a way in which they think they can be effective, which is to provide this kind of police support. That is quite different to what NATO is doing in providing its military support.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout all of these operations, we work very closely with NATO. Indeed, when we were involved with NATO in discussing how best we could support what was occurring in Libya, NATO was very conscious of being engaged in a military fashion, yet needing others to think about how to engage military assets, the kind of equipment that you need in order to support humanitarian aid. So all I would say to those who are worried about the overlap is that we work incredibly hard to make sure that does not exist and we respond to the support that NATO needs and the way in which Member States want to take this forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have to remind anyone that, as you look around at what is happening in countries to which we are close or where we are operating, there are many issues to be concerned about, as I was especially aware when I met the four Ministers from the Sahel over the last few days. They are looking at our comprehensive and strategic approach to how we support them with their concerns about the hunger of their citizens, about terrorism and their worries about arms now moving down from Libya into the Sahel. They need a comprehensive approach to help them do this and that means thinking about how to support them in a security way as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also got to remember that the European Defence Agency is working collaboratively with NATO. Again, improvised explosive devices are a problem that affects not only our servicemen and women from all over the world in Afghanistan, but in many other parts of the world too. If you can provide a joined-up way of actually looking at how you can identify where those explosive devices might be, who might have made them, the kind of signature that is left by those who make bombs of different kinds, if you can do that, you can save lives everywhere. So if this is done by people who can provide the expertise working together, it seems to me an effective use of time, effort and resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who say we also need to think about cyber defence and the importance of how we might respond to that. In this regard, we have been approached by the US Deputy Secretary of Defence to work with them because one of the challenges in cyber defence is that it does not stop at Member State borders, but works across them. Many of the industries and businesses who are most challenged by cyber defence are European as regards their outlets, factories and businesses. They often are a combination of different countries’ businesses working together. So it is logical to try to think of things across the European Union when that makes greater sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say two things to end with. First of all, I agree with all those who say that most of our work should be preventative, that the mediation, the work we do on conflict prevention and using resources to try to prevent conflicts and prevent problems, is absolutely right. I agree with that wholeheartedly. Again, that is complementary to those engaged in theatre in other ways. I agree with what has also been said about the need to be extremely proud of the servicemen and women who are operating in theatre at the present time. As we move to what, for us, is the Christmas and holiday season, I am very conscious that men and women are serving across the world and, especially, as was mentioned, in Afghanistan. I am extremely proud of the work that they do and I know that Members of this House are too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word for Mrs Dodds because she asked me a very specific question about whether we should make sure that those doing lonely, complex jobs in places like Afghanistan actually have the procedures that will help them and that we should get the procedures right. In response to that, can I agree with her and pay tribute to Mr White for the incredible work that he did in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
