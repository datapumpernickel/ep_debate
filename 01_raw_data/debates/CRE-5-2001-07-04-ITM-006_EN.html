<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE), – </span></span>  Mr President, I apologise for my lateness. Human rights seem to have been taking up quite a lot of time, and quite right too.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to express Parliament’s concern that the Kyoto Protocol may falter and fail, leaving the world without any coherent network of obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We in the European Parliament offer our full support to the Commission and to the presidency in their endeavours to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol survives and comes into force. We would like to use this brief debate to explore what Europe can do to lead the world in the absence of American leadership and in what ways the Members of the European Parliament who attend the Bonn Conference can speak for the people of Europe and actively participate in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much appreciate the work of the Dutch Minister, Mr Pronk, in seeking to find a way to solve the unresolved issues left over from The Hague, and we would appreciate it if the Commission could give us its view on how successful he has been to date and whether or not the work he has done has now cleared the way forward. But the big question for us is whether it will be possible to show that the European Union, and the other major parties to the Protocol, are prepared to take decisions without the United States. Here the attitude of the new Japanese government is crucial. Without the votes of Japan and Canada the Protocol cannot enter into force. We gather that the omens are not good and that Japan probably, and Canada certainly, lack the political will to go ahead without the United States. If Japan is prepared to go ahead, then there is the suspicion that the Japanese may want to re-write the crucial proposals within the protocol, notably using the year 2000 perhaps rather than 1990 as the base year for calculating greenhouse gas emission reductions. One of my colleagues, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who will be leading Parliament’s delegation to Bonn, wishes to move an oral amendment on this point to the resolution we have tabled, since the problem with Japan has really only come to the fore in the period since we tabled it.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution reiterates in paragraph 3 our basic expectations about the action that will follow ratification of the protocol. But as Europeans we must make a sober assessment of what this will mean for us if it were to happen and still more if it were to happen without the United States. First and most crucially: money. As the protocol stands, financial contributions from individual parties will be based on each party’s share of CO2 emissions. It is not difficult to see that the United States, with 39% of the total 1990 emissions, would pay the lion’s share. The question that occurs to me, which should perhaps have been asked earlier, is how the Clinton government ever thought it could persuade Congress to sign up to the Treaty. Perhaps greater honesty at the outset might have helped provide a more realistic atmosphere. Without the United States the burden will fall on Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and Australia. The finance available for measures to reduce CO2 emissions in poorer countries will be greatly reduced without US participation. The strain on the Europeans will be greater. Are we prepared for this, I ask?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we ratify Kyoto alone or without the United States it will mean taking certain actions that are going to be painful. We MEPs who follow these issues recognise that. Every year, every month, far into the night, we deal with directives designed to reduce emissions, but we also know that in most instances when we encounter the Council or their representatives it is extremely difficult to get the Member States to agree to these proposals in their original, very demanding form. We now face a situation where, according to the European Environment Agency, only the United Kingdom, Germany and Luxembourg reduced their greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 1998. All the other countries of Europe increased them.</p>
<p class="contents">So how will Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Finland, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Sweden and France, meet the Kyoto targets? Or will we, as the United States suspects, not be willing to take the actions that will give reality to our ambitions? We hope that the Bonn Conference and the Belgian presidency will be able to move the Europeans on from words to action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally a word on the participation of the EU delegation in the Bonn conference. We are tired of being a Greek chorus in this tragedy. We are tired of coming on to stage when the main action has taken place to lament or celebrate what has happened and to offer philosophical reflections on the sad state of mankind – <span class="italic">"Οίμοι η τάλαινα" </span>indeed! This is unsatisfactory because we should ourselves be reckoned as protagonists since we will have to adopt the legislation that will flow from Kyoto and we will have to explain it to the people of Europe. We may not want to be negotiators ourselves, but our ambition is to play a full part in the meetings with the European Union delegation that decides how Europe will act. We are not content to remain as a chorus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On behalf of the Council, I can only reiterate our commitment, as referred to in the Council conclusions of 8 March and 7 June 2001, to reach an agreement at the resumption session of the Conference of the Parties No 6 which is soon to take place in Bonn. This agreement is to safeguard the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol, is to lead to an actual reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, and is to help reach the broadest possible participation of the industrialised countries. In that way, the conditions can be created for the Protocol to be reinforced and to be entered into force by no later than 2002. We therefore confirm our commitment to try to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">All these objectives remain unchanged and the European Union is prepared to negotiate with all partners in Bonn on the unresolved issues in a constructive manner. Although the Council recognises that the European Union and the United States do not see eye to eye concerning the Kyoto Protocol and the ratification thereof, despite this, the Council welcomes the pledge, made by President Bush during a recent meeting with the EU Heads of State and Government leaders, that the United States will not block the Kyoto process, and will cooperate during the forthcoming session of the Conference of the Parties in Bonn in a constructive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">During the high-level consultation of 27 and 28 June last in Scheveningen, the European Union managed to establish fruitful contacts with different partners on climate negotiations. And the European Union was delighted to note that the international community continues to strongly support the Kyoto Protocol and its swift implementation. That is despite the United States’ refusal to ratify the Protocol. As was apparent in Scheveningen, there is a strong sense of urgency with regard to this matter and also a high level of awareness of the fact that the outcome of more than ten years of international negotiations can surely not be put on the line.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Council is of the opinion that your presence is definitely significant, the Council has invited eight MEPs to take part in the Conference in Bonn. The specific conditions for this participation, about which you may not be happy, are explained in a letter from the Council to the European Parliament of 18 November 1998. However, given the wish of the participants for more and regular information, a wish that was underlined by Mrs Jackson, but which certainly reflects the feeling of many among you, the presidency intends to organise informal meetings with the MEPs during the conference at regular intervals, thus allowing an exchange of ideas to take place about the progress and the state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jackson, I am aware that this may not satisfy you entirely, but on the other hand, it does mean that you will be able to do more than just sing or lament on the sidelines or behind the scenes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the President-in-Office has already said, in Gothenburg, the heads of state and government confirmed that the European Community and the Member States are determined to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The Union’s summit reaffirmed the European Union’s aim of bringing the Protocol into force by 2002 and asked the Commission to prepare a proposal for ratification before the end of 2001. Regrettably, the Bush administration continues to oppose the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Union/United States Summit in Gothenburg, President Bush acknowledged the science underlying climate change and the global importance of this issue. The United States has indicated that while they will participate actively in the resumed COP6 in Bonn, their basic position, opposing the Protocol has not changed. We will build upon this indication that the United States does not intend to obstruct the Kyoto process. To facilitate this, we have agreed that there will be further high-level contacts with the United States on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The resumed COP6 in July will pick up the threads of the conference in The Hague and try and bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. To achieve this, the European Union will take a positive attitude while, at the same time, being realistic about what can be achieved. The new consolidated texts by the Chairman of COP6, Mr Pronk, are clear and concise and provide a good basis for the Bonn negotiations. However, the texts still contain a number of important sticking points for the European Union, notably on funding for developing countries, compliance and supplementarity. These need to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, we will strive for an overall package where compromises on one side are balanced out by gains on the other. We must also take into account the specific importance of Japan and Russia for the entry into force of the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the strong interest of the European Parliament in the global problem of climate change and the participation of Members of the European Parliament in the Community delegation to the resumed COP6. As in The Hague, the Commission and Council, the President-in-Office has explained, have proposed that the European Parliament be represented by eight Members. In accordance with the institutional rules for their participation, the Members can attend plenary meetings, and the Commission will regularly provide information on those negotiations which are not open to observers on a regular basis to all Members of the European Parliament present at COP6. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to state that I was far from satisfied with the way in which the Secretary of State answered the legitimate questions asked by Caroline Jackson. The European Parliament’s delegation is not asking for privileges. It is asking for its legitimate right to participate actively in the Bonn conference and not simply to play spear-carrier, as we did at the Hague Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is more than just another environmental dossier. It has become an issue that truly symbolises the international political agenda. If the Kyoto Protocol fails, the interpretation will be clear: States and politicians move rapidly and effectively when it comes to promoting the advantages of globalisation, but they are incapable of reaching agreement on minimising the less pleasant aspects of our social model.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation could not be worse. On the one hand, action is more urgent today than it ever has been and the measures announced recently by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change leave no room for doubt on this matter. On the other hand, it has never been as difficult to take action as it is today: the decision by the United States has dealt a harsh blow to international efforts over the last ten years. These factors, urgency of action, pressure from the public and the withdrawal of the United States make the Bonn Conference critical. It will really be the moment of truth for the Kyoto Protocol. Our position is perfectly clear: it is crucial that we limit climate change and the Kyoto Protocol – and none other – is the most appropriate political instrument for achieving this objective. Let us, therefore, go to Bonn with the aim of concluding an agreement with as many countries as possible on the ‘left overs’ from Kyoto so that the Protocol can be ratified and implemented in 2002. In order for the negotiations to be successful, in particular with Japan and Russia, we will clearly have to be flexible, but in a way that respects the integrity and the spirit of the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say one last word about economic issues. It is true that, in the short term, implementing the Protocol will result in economic costs to European businesses. Nevertheless, these costs, as we read only this week in the Commission’s report, will be much lower than was initially thought. I am, in fact, convinced that in the medium term, the Kyoto Protocol will make the European economy more competitive as a result of the technological transformation that we will achieve earlier than elsewhere in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is obviously some sort of consensus in public opinion in the USA as well, but public opinion in the USA is different from Europe’s. This is why I believe we should not only be talking to one or two parliamentarians or government representatives; the Europeans should actually be thinking how they can influence public opinion in the USA, and indeed in Japan, if the Japanese decide not to go ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of managing climate change is so enormous that going it alone will be extremely difficult. That is precisely the issue which arises here. Even if the others do not go ahead, are we prepared to continue the course agreed at Gothenburg, which I support? Making a verbal commitment is easy. Agreeing to take on these burdens is simple and costs nothing. However, translating this into reality will be an immensely difficult task. My fear – I admit this quite openly – is that the Europeans, or many Europeans, will hide behind the US. In truth, we are a long way off meeting the standards set in the Kyoto Protocol. We all know that. The Commission feeds us a never-ending stream of fresh statistics. We face a Herculean task – I just want to make this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these difficulties, however, let me say that for the first time since the Second World War, Europe now has the opportunity to take on political leadership at world level. We should grasp this opportunity with both hands, well aware that this is not a simple task. Incidentally, it is a noble task, not a dirty job, which Europe should address, and if others do not join us until later, we should accept this with good grace.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment relates to the text itself. I cannot stop myself from saying this: I must point out that what we are demanding, namely "halting" climate change, is sheer nonsense, of course. I have no idea how this slipped into the text. There has always been climate change, but this time, we are making our own contribution to it, and that is exactly what this is all about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think any of the parliamentarians have any doubt at all about her passionate personal commitment towards trying to secure a positive outcome from the talks in Bonn, and I would also like to say a word of thanks to my Liberal colleague, Prime Minister Verhofstadt, for the emphasis he placed this morning on saying that the problem of climate change is the greatest single challenge facing the planet. One thing that this whole issue has brought about – if it was needed – is a great awareness that this is a very small planet upon which we live and that mankind is very capable, through its industrial practices, of changing our environment. Even the United States now recognises this, although they have yet to come up with an alternative in any practical form to the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">There are great opportunities for, and advantages in, addressing this problem by using technology which is in the process of being developed or has been developed to change our practices and reduce global warming. This offers great benefits to society, and economic opportunities for those of us who take a lead, but why are we not able to pursue this more effectively? One problem is vested interests – the classic example being the fossil fuel industries; another is weak political leadership by all of us – we are all responsible for this. We back down over taking decisions which will be unpopular in the short term with our electorates. I wish to see harmonised environmental taxation at a European level – the objective being not to raise more money but to change practices and priorities and ensure that industry at the same time is able to compete on a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had the problems – we have experienced the problems with fuel duty in Britain and elsewhere whenever politicians try really to apply taxes which benefit the environment in this way. The odd thing of course, in Britain’s case, is that harmonised energy taxation on fuel duties would also probably reduce our taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just returned from a visit to Cyprus – one of the accession countries – where I find out that not only is there no fuel duty on the use of petrol but that petrol is actually subsidised. So, my question to the Commission is this: when it comes to practical forms, when it comes to actually dealing with what I hope will be a positive outcome from Bonn, how does the Council pursue harmonised energy taxation at the same time as dealing with enlargement, which makes the possibility of unanimity so much more difficult to achieve if it we were actually to have harmonised environmental taxation of a sort which is worth having. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, Messrs Bush and Blair are trying to breathe new life into nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with a clear majority in the European Parliament, my group believes that nuclear energy should not, and cannot, play a role in solving the climate problem, not even in the “clean development” mechanism. On all other scores – I repeat, all other scores – the Greens can accept a compromise in Bonn. That compromise must aim to keep Japan on board. Even a higher reduction target for Europe is to be considered. The Commission has recently published a study which shows that a reduction target which is twice as high as the current one is not a problem for us economically speaking. Europe must now seriously look into renewable energy and saving energy.</p>
<p class="contents">A further development of solar energy is desperately needed to provide electricity to the last two billion people on this earth. Providing two billion people with electricity generated by fossil fuels would spell an uncertain climate death to us all. A weak agreement in Bonn is better than another fiasco. The 1987 Treaty of Montreal protecting the ozone layer was also a weak agreement, but over the past fourteen years, it has been tightened up on every occasion. We could adopt the same approach with the Kyoto Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must use this unanimity to put maximum pressure on those countries which are now deciding the future of the Kyoto Protocol. In practice, we risk some sort of collapse in climate negotiations, a collapse which would risk setting us back several years. The worst thing is that those causing the collapse, particularly the US, have <span class="italic">no</span> alternative to offer. Therefore, everything must now be done to save whatever can be saved.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union itself has a credibility problem because, as previous speakers have said, many of our Member States will not meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, either. We know that these requirements in themselves are insufficient to combat the problem of climate change. What we see in practice when we meet the Council of Ministers, for example in conciliation on combustion plants and national ceilings for emissions, is that no-one is prepared to take the decisions which need to be taken. By the time a decision was to be made in Gothenburg on a strategy for sustainable development, many of the most important points had been removed. Of course the EU’s credibility would also increase if we showed by our actions that we are prepared to meet the targets we set ourselves. I believe this is important ahead of the meetings which we are about to have with other countries in order to decide the future of the Kyoto Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has already been mentioned that the Conference for Climate Change will be held in Bonn from 16-27 July 2001. We know that the US Government and the European Union could not reach agreement in the Netherlands before Christmas on setting a timetable for the reduction of the use of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, it is very clear that the US Government is getting cold feet on the Kyoto Agreement. This is very disappointing. There is clear and unequivocal scientific evidence that demonstrates the effect of climate change. Surely, the US and the European Union governments can agree on one item, and that is simply that the use of greenhouse gases depletes the ozone layer which results in higher sea levels and more coastal erosion, and affects the living environment of island communities. I am calling on the European governments which will be represented in Bonn to use this conference as an opportunity to tell the US that this is not good enough, and that the full provisions of the Kyoto Agreement must be implemented: under the Agreement alone, the US Government would be required to cut emissions by approximately one-third by the year 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new US President, Mr Bush, has meanwhile rejected the Kyoto Protocol. This is referred to as a huge disgrace, with good reason. On the other hand, <span class="italic">this</span> US President makes no secret of how the United States feels about the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The unfortunate result of this is that Japan is also questioning whether it should ratify the protocol. Last week, the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, said that he does not intend to go ahead without the backing of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should realise that the countries of the European Union have not ratified or implemented the Kyoto Protocol either. CO2 emissions may have fallen considerably in Luxembourg, Germany and Great Britain, but they have risen quite dramatically in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. According to the Worldwide Fund for Nature prognosis, CO2 emissions in the European Union will be rising by eight percent in total, instead of falling by eight percent, as per the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it would be very inconsistent if the European Union were to blame the United States for not being prepared to do anything to reduce CO2 emissions, if the European Union is not willing to continue to reduce Nox emissions itself. The US emission standards for Nox in 2003 are already stricter than what the Environment Ministers want within the framework of the directive on large furnaces in 2018.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the risk that the failure of the Kyoto Protocol will be used as an excuse for not having to do anything. The threat of climate change remains, so does the objective to counter this, with or without the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should, therefore, not follow the example of the United States or Japan, but must fight climate change by focusing on saving energy, energy efficiency by, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, total energy, and by developing wind and solar energy. With regard to these aspects, it should also be possible to conclude agreements with the United States and Japan. In addition, we must be open to extending the proportion that can be achieved by emission trade. If we can persuade the United States to re-join the negotiations in that way, we should certainly do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should no longer neglect third world countries, since energy consumption there is also set to rise considerably. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having agreed in 1997 on an international strategy for reducing polluting emissions, we cannot accept such a drastic and important change in approach towards the situation, which gives credence to arguments which, under a scientific veneer, intend to postpone the intensity and force of specific actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that this proposed resolution is a necessary gesture by the European Parliament towards the Member States as an expression of the renewal of a political will in each of them to combat climate change and to intensify the establishment of the mechanisms necessary for the ratification of the protocol.</p>

Therefore, and in order to take the next step of negotiating with other countries a rapid ratification of the protocol, it is so important that this Parliament should unite in supporting the present proposal, renewing, as I have said, the European Union’s will for international leadership in the field of the environment and as a gesture towards the Member States, so that they do not forget or delay the implementation on a national level of the measures necessary for the ratification of the protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is not all: for many European issues, we have to battle against public opinion, but in this debate, we have the backing of a huge majority of the public opinion which is urging governments to take further steps in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that on the eve of Bonn, we have to propose a number of measures at the Conference, but also at Community and national level. As has been said a few times, we can, and must, as Europe, play a global role in this debate. This role suits us without a doubt, and largely discredits others, of course, including Mr Bush and his administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also try to bring the others on board, that we must definitely do, but not by putting concluded agreements at risk. If the Protocol is adopted with unlimited trade in hot air or unlimited use of coal pits, the effect on the climate will be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add one point to the debate. I do not think there is room for complacency. We have not yet ratified the Protocol either, nor have we completed any clear, concrete plans of action. I would therefore urge the Belgian presidency to tackle this issue with both hands. In what form will we be trading our emissions? Will this be done among States, or also among businesses? And how will the trade among sectors be regulated? And also, what is the latest on the national plans of action? What are we going to do about them, and have any budgets been earmarked in this connection? I should therefore ask the Belgian presidency to address this matter properly in the next couple of months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intergovernmental panel on climate change has no doubt that there is global warming taking place and that greenhouse gases, in particular CO2 emissions, are largely responsible. Even the US National Academy of Sciences advising President Bush largely concurs with this finding. The EU is now determined to go it alone, but the biggest culprit, the US, with 4% of the world’s population and 25% of global emissions, still will not co-operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, to date, only Romania has ratified the Protocol. Japan and Canada are now getting cold feet without US involvement. In my country, the UK, under a Conservative Government, we made a dash for gas, since natural gas produces far less CO2 than coal. We went on to see it rapidly reversed by the new Labour Government, anxious to preserve jobs in the mining industry. Mercifully the UK is still online to meet its Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already witnessing in European winter resorts in the mountains the effects of the rising snow line, but the long-term prospects are far more frightening. At some point, there is a danger of thermal runaway as the polar caps melt, reflect less sunshine and cause a rapid increase in atmospheric warming. This threatens flooding around the globe and other climatic changes causing economic devastation with huge migratory pressures on peoples, not to mention potential wars over water supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the solution? I believe that all nations must subscribe to policies of sustainable economic development and invest in renewable energy sources. This also means reopening the controversial nuclear power debate, which I support. We must also look at using market-based mechanisms, such as tradeable emission permits. The Kyoto 5% targeted reduction by 2010 from 1990 levels may not go far enough. We may also have to look again at carbon sinks. I believe that the US must reconsider its position and come back to Bonn with some really good proposals. I congratulate my colleague, Mrs Jackson on her continuing interest in this critical area for the future of mankind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effects are being felt in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the island states. We desperately need a warm-hearted approach to developing countries, and a fund that allows for adjustments being made.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise that if the United States does not take part, the incentive for the developing countries will actually be taken away, for it is precisely the United States that wanted to realise a large proportion of their duties outside of the US.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union now has to assume this role, and do more for the developing countries. Needless to say, the developing countries will in time need to be included in system of CO2 reductions, but then on the basis of equal emission rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must commit ourselves to taking domestic action seriously and not to promoting nuclear energy. We must now take swift action and launch a credible and reliable system for the trade in emission rights, and within Europe, we must set up a research agenda to make the transition to a low-CO2 economy possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the EU delegation did not show itself to its best advantage in The Hague. Indecisiveness and dissension contributed to the failure of The Hague. Parliamentarians could play a role if they gain permission to attend the delegation meetings as observers. As the President-in-Council stated a moment ago, we sang and lamented behind the scenes, but to no avail. Therefore, we now want to be admitted in the delegation as observers, and we believe that this can strengthen the unity within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So that we might remember what we are dealing with, I will reiterate a few facts about climatic warming. I would like to remind you that there is now ample scientific proof regarding this matter, and that climatic warming is a hard fact. There is just one party we have to negotiate with, and that is nature, which does not make compromises. It just is.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest time series analyses of seawater temperatures say the same as what we have known about air temperatures for a long time. During the last hundred years the seas have warmed up by 0.6 degrees, and the trend is accelerating. In terms of average temperatures this is a very great change. Glaciers are melting; 85% of them are receding at a very fast rate, as much as several tens of metres a year at their worst. The Andean ice caps are in danger of disappearing altogether. The polar icecaps have shrunk by 25% in the last three years. In northern areas of continents the permafrost is melting at a dramatic rate, especially in central Siberia and Alaska. This also has large-scale effects on the exploitation of natural resources in these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we allow global warming to continue, the dreaded, worst-case scenario in northwestern Europe may well take place. Warming could divert North Atlantic sea currents, causing northern Fennoscandia to have a far more severely cold climate than it does now as a result. As the glaciers melt, the so-called Atlantic pump will cease working and the warm Gulf Stream coming up from the tropics and its extension, the North Atlantic Current, will stop flowing. This could result in the whole of northwestern Europe becoming colder, which palaeo-oceanographic studies show could happen suddenly, with catastrophic results.</p>
<p class="contents">The same facts reveal themselves in every direction. Just recently the Red Cross confirmed what other aid organisations have been saying: experience of an increased number of natural disasters shows that the change can be put down to global warming. Unless we act quickly and, furthermore, put pressure on others also to act quickly, these new phenomena will increase exponentially. Bonn needs to be a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that climate change is one of the best documented of any of our environmental problems and, at the same time, the biggest threat to the environment and to future generations here on earth. That is why the US administration’s rejection of the Kyoto protocol is, of course, also completely irresponsible. I think we have to acknowledge that Mr Bush and his administration have shown themselves to be just as primitive and populist as might have been feared. However, that attitude in the United States ought, of course, only to give an edge to Europe’s responsibility for global environmental development, as Mr Da Silva too pointed out. We must stick by the Kyoto Protocol at the conference in The Hague. We must ensure that the Member States and the EU are in the vanguard of efforts to get the Protocol ratified so that it can, if possible, come into force next year. With that in mind, we must naturally try to make Japan stick to this solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Van Brempt, I would warn against entering into a sub-standard conciliation or agreement with the United States. Experience has shown time and again that when the United States has ended up with what, in our eyes, is a really bad agreement, it fails to honour it when the time comes to implement it. On the contrary, we in Europe must ensure that our climate change programme is implemented effectively. As quite a few people have mentioned, we also have problems here in Europe. At the moment, we are seeing a clear negative trend in the area of transport, for example. We must work to ensure that, given the future we are now confronting, the United States does not obtain a competitive advantage from showing the kind of irresponsibility we have seen so far. I hope that the Bonn conference may nonetheless be a decisive step towards meeting the enormous challenge we are all facing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I would go as far as to say that it may even be the single most important challenge overall, also beyond the parameters of environmental policy. There is thus a great deal at stake in Bonn. It is important, then, for the European Union to present a united front, and so I appeal to the Council and the Commission to include the parliamentary delegation in its activities and ensure that the head of our delegation, at least, is involved in coordination at EU level, as we are keen to support the Council and the Commission’s position. Naturally, this is only possible if we are genuinely informed in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem, of course, is the USA’s position. This has already been pointed out several times. It is not enough merely to agree that the USA’s position is unacceptable. Since gentle persuasion and appeals have not achieved very much, we must now consider how we can exert even greater pressure. The European Union should make climate protection and the Kyoto Agreement its key priority in relations with the US. Many of our positions differ from those of the US Government or Congress, but climate protection is the major problem, and that should be made clear. This is why I was rather disappointed when, after Gothenburg, the message was: there is a difference of opinion, and that was it. The EU must make it quite clear that while we may have different opinions on other issues and still carry on with the agenda, this specific topic is a priority for the EU. Perhaps we should go as far as to make concessions in other areas in order to ensure that this priority is genuinely asserted in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Americans are then prepared to ratify Kyoto and engage in practical cooperation in Bonn, we too should be flexible. Instead of promoting the EU’s purist doctrine, e.g. on nuclear energy, we too should be prepared to compromise. However, a precondition is that the Americans actually commit themselves to ratifying Kyoto and pursuing the climate protection process in a positive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
