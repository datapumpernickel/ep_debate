Monterrey's success is founded, among other things, on the innovative form that the conference took, which enabled the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organisation to take an active part as partners on an equal footing. It was the first time the European Community had been accorded the status of a full participant at a UN conference. What had originally been meant to be a conventional United Nations event became a meeting on a significantly broader scale, and one that, it is to be hoped, will promote future coordination of its principal participants and cooperation between them.</p>
<p class="contents">The conference was also innovative in form in the sense that the Final Document – known as the Monterrey Consensus – had already been agreed on in New York in January. And, as no negotiations as such took place, the participants in the conference concentrated on round table discussions alongside the events and also at bilateral meetings, rather than only on sessions spent discussing wording and drafting the Final Document. This made it possible to focus debate on potential concrete commitments, bilateral initiatives and tangible contributions. In addition, the conference built upon the so far unique global consensus achieved at the Millennium Summit on objectives, policy and indicators in the development field.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential challenge for the Conference on Financing for Development was to mobilise the financial resources required in order for the Millennium Summit's development policy objectives to be achieved. This meant that the conference could pursue a clearer and better-defined objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of 11 September had a far-reaching influence on the way the international community saw and understood this conference, bringing as they did in a tragic way the extent to which we depend on each other to the attention of a vast public quite apart from those who concern themselves with issues of development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this backdrop that what is no doubt the conference's most important and most visible outcome should be seen – the simultaneous commitments by the European Union and the USA to increase their public-sector development aid by a further USD 20 billion and USD 10 billion respectively. President Bush's announcement of the allocation of USD 5 billion, a sum then further increased in the course of the week in order to catch the EU up, is also evidence of a change in thinking by the USA on its development policy, the estimates for which have been subject to continuous cutbacks over the past 20 years. It is no presumption to say that we, the European Union, are in a leadership role, in which we can also, accordingly, present ourselves to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These commitments were widely welcomed and were the inevitable response to the declared willingness of most of the developing countries to mobilise their own resources and accept the imposition of good domestic governance. They can thus be seen as a partial implementation of the statements contained in the Monterrey Consensus, and accord with the European Union's concept of development policy as a global agreement also including Dohar, Monterrey and Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">A few aspects of Monterrey did not meet expectations, and I will list three of them: Problems inherent in systems, innovative sources of finance for development, and global public goods. As regards problems inherent in systems, the Monterrey Consensus limits itself to underlining the importance of paying greater attention, in the international financial architecture, to the voice of the developing countries. There are, though, no concrete proposals on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The document contains nothing more on innovative sources of finance for development than a general statement of the need to examine these questions more thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">Global public goods are not mentioned at all, so the Johannesburg Conference offers a second opportunity to address these aspects, one that, I believe, we must make use of.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by referring to the role played in this process by the Commission, which had, even before the Council met in Laeken, put the case in the political arena for the Member States to substantially build up their ODAs. The Development Council of 8 November last year took an initial step in that direction by entrusting the Commission with the task of examining these issues more closely. This process then led to the Barcelona European Council resolution in which the Member States agreed for the first time to consult with each other on their development budgets and above all to give the Commission a coordinating role. It is my belief that these results speak for themselves.</p>

<p class="contents">In order to give fresh impetus to the international consensus regarding debt reduction and to respond to the international community’s growing concerns regarding the increasing marginalisation of the least-developed countries within the world economy, the Commission is now, with this communication, proposing full cancellation of the debts linked to any of the special loans granted to the least-developed ACP countries under the first three Lomé Conventions which are still outstanding following the introduction of debt-relief measures under the HIPC initiative launched in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a brief overview of the situation. The problem of external debt and the ability to service the interest payable on that debt continues to be one of the basic constraints on economic development in the poor countries. These countries – most of which are located in Africa – allocate on average 40% of their annual budgets to debt servicing, which reduces their investment capacity and therefore their ability to offer their people basic social services such as healthcare and education. Paradoxically, the development aid provided by the EU and its Member States to the world's poorest countries is sometimes not even sufficient to cover the cost of servicing their external debt. In addition, the global economic slowdown is deepening as a result of the events of September 11 2001, exacerbating the already severe problems of these communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are some figures: the debt of the HIPCs increased from USD 147 billion in 1989 to USD 214 billion in 2001; at present, 41 of the world’s poorest countries are in a situation of bankruptcy and 300 out of every 600 HIPC citizens survive on less than a dollar per day. I will spare you the details of the lives of these people, suffering from illnesses such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, of which, moreover, there is currently an upsurge, or of the situation, in particular, of children, people with disabilities or sick people, seeing as there are no elderly people to speak of in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-six countries have become eligible for debt relief now, having reached what is known as the decision point, and can now benefit directly from the cut in debt servicing, but to officially exploit this relief, reaching the completion point – which has currently only been reached by four countries, moreover – they must implement a pre-established package of social and structural reforms and maintain sound macroeconomic performance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is strange, however, that no deadline has been set for them to reach this completion point, although the average time frame should be at least 15 months in practice. Moreover, such a short time period gives the highly indebted countries little time to develop multisectoral strategies for combating poverty and forces local governments to spend money and funds on reaching the completion point rather than on implementing a sustainable programme and a credible plan for combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, however, we can say that the enhanced HIPC initiative is still, on its own, wholly inadequate to resolve the issue in the current context of economic globalisation, even though it acknowledges the failure of earlier programmes and initiatives based on macroeconomic strategies, for it does not, in actual fact, decrease the nominal debt of the HIPCs. If the size of the debt is not radically reduced, these countries will be condemned to repaying it forever and ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the European Parliament and the Commission, in particular, have firmly upheld the need to cancel this debt, not least in the wake of the Jubilee 2000 campaign in which a range of different political, civil and religious organisations and movements – led by the Holy See – vehemently demanded the complete cancellation of the debt. In particular, I feel that it is important to emphasise the involvement of the Holy Father, who, during the Jubilee year, which was a year of charity, called for greater, more effective focus on the problems of poverty which are still afflicting the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Monterrey, although it was criticised as the umpteenth display of mere grand declarations on the part of the wealthy countries, I feel that it should still be seen as a positive development for it led to an increase in practical goals. Evidence of this is, in fact, the Union’s commitment to providing a further USD 20 billion dollars of aid by 2006 and USD 7 billion dollars after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Madam President, I feel that there are a number of initiatives that can help these countries, not least the use of new technologies, as discussed at Palermo just a few weeks ago on the initiative of the Italian Government, the World Bank and the UN: applying new technologies to debt management systems, including national debt management systems, and budget monitoring, which would certainly help public administrations to give us clear, practical indications of the target to be set and deal with the concern which is holding us back, which is these countries’ arms purchases and their failure to transfer benefits and use them to fund the social and economic poverty reduction initiatives and, of course, the social and healthcare projects which, on the other hand, these countries do need.</p>

He persuaded the 15 Member States of the European Union to make a commitment that by 2006 their contribution for development finance will be 0.33% of GDP. Many Member States are currently contributing much less than this. This achievement embarrassed the United States, because it realised that its contribution is very small indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union gives USD 25 billion: it is the largest donor in the world. The United States gives USD 10 billion. This is a very small sum when you think that the United States has given its military establishment USD 100 billion since September last year, and that is why President Bush promised a further USD 5 billion in development finance by 2006. That would bring the US contribution up to USD 15 billion, which is still very low indeed when you think that people like Bill Gates give USD 1 billion as personal donations.</p>
<p class="contents">Because Mr Fischler is here, I would like to say that EU agricultural subsidies are killing the poor farmers in the Third World. He knows this and I know he is in favour of persuading Member States to do something about the food mountains that we create. This was widely discussed in Monterrey with the International Fund for Agricultural Development. I and my colleagues met with the President of IFAD. It was made very clear that unless we invest this development finance in the rural economies of poor countries and boost their agricultural production, we will have a breeding ground for deprivation, terrorism and internal conflicts. This is because these are the people, the majority of them living in rural areas, who are too poor to grow their own food and too poor to buy the EU's surplus food.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one other point about HIV, AIDS, TB and malaria. The Monterrey conference did not discuss these issues at great length, and did not commit itself to allocating funding to them in a special category. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This has been a Conference of contrasts. There are positive aspects which it would be unfair not to stress, but we must also recognise, as the Commissioner has done, that on certain aspects our expectations for this Conference have not been fulfilled and, of course, this Parliament’s expectations had been expressed by means of a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, to have a consensus document, drawn up previously in January in New York, has the positive effect of allowing the participants to dedicate their time to meetings and achieve very significant bilateral commitments, to participate in round tables. But, on the other hand, we also revealed what our weaknesses and limitations were and how far we were willing to go. We knew previously that certain issues might be put on the backburner, because for the sake of reaching a consensus, particularly with the United States, the European Union was going to give in. I believe that this has been a failing on the part of the Council: to demonstrate this weakness. Of course, it was not the European Union that was represented there; it was the European Commission, the delegation of the European Community, since the European Union does not yet have its own personality.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive aspects include the commitment to a budgetary increase in development funds by Europe, as well as better coordination between the Member States, and the fact that the United States has also committed itself to increasing its contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe we will have to continue working towards the next Johannesburg commitment, where we will have to define the issues relating to new sources of funding – which have not been discussed – to global resources – nothing has been agreed in this respect either – and also stress the need to listen more to developing countries and seek a solution to their foreign debt.</p>
<p class="contents">We must commit ourselves to continuing to work towards Johannesburg, in order to fulfil the objectives of the Millennium Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must do this for our peace of mind, and we must do this for the sake of world peace. Efforts must be made across a broad front. The developing countries must have access to our markets so that they themselves can create the basis for their economic progress. Sound frameworks for private investment must be guaranteed, but foreign aid in the traditional form of transfer payments is still necessary. It is disgraceful that, over the last decade, the rich countries have reduced the share of their income that they give to poor countries. I would therefore praise Commissioner Nielson for the success there has been in initiating an agreement to the effect that the EU countries will increase aid. This agreement means that the most tight-fisted countries must make a contribution corresponding to the current EU average. The level of ambition must be higher, however. The objective must in every case be 0.7% of GNP, a figure which most EU countries do not at present meet and which the United States and Japan unfortunately fall still farther short of meeting. Admittedly, experience shows that there is not always a straightforward proportionate link between the extent of the aid and the results in the shape of development. That is why it is all the more gratifying that, with Monterrey, a common understanding now seems to have been established that development must take place through interaction between donor countries, NGOs and developing countries so that the developing countries are given responsibility for their own development and so that, as a condition of receiving aid, they guarantee democracy, legal certainty and human rights and combat the corruption that destroys many opportunities for progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is certainly a very modest start to the joint process. However, I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler how the Commission intends to ensure that the Member States also really commit to this target in legal terms, so that this does not just remain a political resolution, and how you see the Member States sharing the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surely the case that the countries that have reached the 0.7% target for GNP – Sweden, Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – will not pay any more before they see the countries that are lagging behind take responsibility for their share too. This is all about very large sums of money. As my fellow Members have already mentioned here today, from 2006 EU countries will need to find an extra seven billion dollars per annum and a total of 20 billion dollars before then. How do you intend to accomplish this?</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for us to take a longer policy view of the situation already at this stage. As a result, our group is proposing that at Johannesburg the EU should commit to reaching the 0.7% target by the year 2010. I would ask other groups to support this target, on which we will shortly be able to vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that the Conference produced some small steps forward,<span class="italic"> </span>especially if we consider the current situation of development funding and if we take account of the very limited prospects that had already been outlined before the Conference. Amongst these steps, I include, of course, the proposals by the European Union to increase its development aid by USD 20 billion by 2006 and even the annual increase of USD 5 billion that the United States has proposed. I am also taking account of the fact that the European Union has set, for the first time and in a way that is binding on the Member States, the precise and focussed objective of achieving 0.39% of GDP by 2006 as the Community average and as an interim stage for achieving the objective of 0.7%.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be acknowledged, however, that these are excessively limited steps, which fall considerably short of current needs and possibilities. Moreover, this is the only conclusion that we can draw, given the constant reductions we have seen in the field of public development aid in the last decade, of which all but a limited number of Member States of the European Union are guilty, as if to confirm the rule. Such a conclusion is also inevitable if we consider the decisions and recommendations reiterated on successive occasions by the United Nations, specifically the objectives of the millennium plan to reduce extreme poverty by 2015, or even the very hopes raised by the commitment given at the Gothenburg Council to achieve the objective of 0.7% as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be added, however, that no measure was adopted on solving the problem of external debt, despite the fact that this is still one of the fundamental parameters of the economic development of the poorest countries, as Mr Mantovani states in the courageous explanatory statement of his report, which we welcome. In this framework, given the importance of the financial strand, I would say that the results of September’s World Summit on Sustainable Development look as though they are going to have a rather more limited scope than we would wish them to have. Let us hope, nevertheless, that, in this and in other fields, more promising steps can be taken in Johannesburg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I welcome the Community’s undertaking to fully cancel the debts of the highly indebted and least developed countries linked to special loans. Of course, these are only the first steps in what will, of necessity, be a long, major process. Indeed, genuine debt cancellation is now truly the only possible way to give many of the developing countries the chance to find a way out of the spiral of debt, out of what is known as the debt trap, to give these countries the hope of being able to compete on a global market and the practical opportunity to do so, and to give their people a future in which they can genuinely combat poverty, hunger and illness on a practical level.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we must demand a commitment from these countries that they will respect human rights, abandon war as a means of resolving disputes and use the funds released by debt cancellation for responsible, monitored poverty reduction programmes, while guaranteeing wider democratic involvement of civil society. It is therefore worth specifying that the debt cancellation or alleviation measures must not be seen as an excuse to reduce development aid: quite the opposite, development aid does need to be monitored but it must certainly be increased and encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that Europe has a responsibility to provide essential support to the poorest countries of the developing world through a long-term undertaking to help these countries and support them during a process of far-reaching change and economic and social development, in addition to cancelling the debt. The success of the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings is also dependent on the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and communities achieving a future of peace, progress and economic and social justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite the opposite, I feel that Monterrey fell far short of what was required and of the targets we needed to achieve. We are currently talking of first steps, and it is quite absurd to think that we are still, today, at an initial stage, since the call for 0.7% has been on the table since 1970 and we are now saying that we might be able to achieve 0.3 or 0.31%, and we do not even know when!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even more disappointingly, there was not one word at Monterrey about the structural reforms that need to be carried out, from the dismantling of the protectionist policies we apply to our own markets such as agriculture and textiles, to the removal of the US protection of its steel market, not to mention the reforms that need to be carried out in the HIPC countries to facilitate the rule of law and the first steps towards democratic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that, from this perspective, Monterrey fell far short of expectations and that we will all suffer greatly for this considerable indifference in the face of such a huge-scale problem, and it will not just be the developing countries that suffer but, I fear, we and our false securities too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must have the courage genuinely to cancel the debt completely in order to release resources and make economic and social growth possible in those countries, and debt cancellation must on no account be taken as an excuse to reduce development aid. On the contrary, the principle, established by the United Nations and confirmed by the Brussels European Council last November, of increasing the funds made available to support developing countries to 0.7% of GDP must be converted into a practical commitment, and Europe must proceed in the same way and with the same determination as when it respected the Maastricht parameters and introduced the single currency. We must establish a precise timetable, stages and monitoring systems to ensure that all the Member States of the European Union respect this commitment, and, alongside this initiative, we must introduce an embargo on the sale of all forms of arms, including light weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clear from the Monterrey Conference too. We need new ways of proceeding: we need to accord the role of the UN due importance and it is right and necessary to extend the G8 to Africa and Latin America, for it is unthinkable that representatives of the countries involved, of the least wealthy countries in the world, should not have a say in decisions affecting them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must quite simply cancel the debts of highly indebted poor countries and put in place an arbitration procedure for intermediary countries that are in crisis, such as Argentina. Most of these debts are illegitimate, as they were arranged by corrupt, even dictatorial governments, and have, in fact, never been used to benefit the population. The total amount of third-world debt has already been repaid six times over in interest. What a paradox this is! Today, the debt repayments made by the countries of the south are higher than the development aid provided by the north. Having pillaged the raw materials of the south at the lowest possible price, the north is now benefiting from this financial flux and is maintaining its de facto domination, which consequently makes the problem of poverty worse.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, cancel this debt. However, the money that is saved from doing this must be reinvested, not in arms or in anything else, but in social budgets that will first and foremost improve public services, health and education. Unfortunately, the Monterrey conference did not tackle this issue in any depth, nor that of introducing a tax on financial transactions. As for setting the official development aid target of 0.39% of GDP, this is no victory. We still have a long way to go before we reach 0.7%. In ten years’ time, will we be satisfied with the 0.22% that we have formally committed? No, I think that we must take action now. We must cancel the debt now. We must grant a great deal more than 0.39% of GDP for aid, and I personally think that the Monterrey conference was a failure. It was a failure for the European Union, but, more importantly, it was a failure for the countries of the south. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN development programme and Unicef are responding to these disturbing statistics and they have calculated, for example, that an annual expenditure of USD 80 billion over a period of 10 years could guarantee every human being access to basic education, to basic medical care and to adequate nutrition, to drinking water and to health infrastructures, and, for women, access to gynaecological and maternity treatment: this sum is four times less than the amount the developing world repays in interest on its debt, a quarter of the US military budget, 18% of the amount spent on advertising in the world, 9% of the military expenditure in the world or half the assets of the four wealthiest people in the world.

The first, agriculture, is one that touches on my direct powers. The observation was made that, in many developing countries, the European Union is killing the farmers. That sort of comment really cannot be left unchallenged, and I would like to enlighten you a bit about how our import and export situation looks at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out to you that the European Union at present imports more agricultural produce from developing countries than do the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan put together. The other developed states have nothing to reproach us for.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make to you is that we are a net importer from the developing countries, which means that we import more agricultural produce from these states than we export to them – an immense contrast to the states I just mentioned, which are all great net exporters. Let me also, finally, point out to you that, in all the major sectors, the European Union's share of agricultural produce exports has declined in the course of the last five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by reminding you that we should at last stop blaming ourselves for things that no longer exist. If you really must still talk about the massive surplus mountains in the European Union, then I invite you to show me them sometime. We no longer have surplus mountains. What we have is balanced production.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue that was raised had to do with how we intend to ensure that the Member States actually keep to the commitments they make in Council. On this point I have to draw your attention to the fact that what the Member States have committed themselves to is a general declaration by the Council, no more and no less. No legal instrument is available to us to actually demand these amounts at law; instead, the only thing we can do when individual Member States fail to honour this obligation is together – the Commission and you in Parliament – to remind those Member States of how important it is that they should do so.</p>
