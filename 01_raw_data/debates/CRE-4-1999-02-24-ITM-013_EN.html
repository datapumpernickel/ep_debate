<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Lassus Saint Geniès </span> <span class="bold">(ARE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone agrees that research and innovation are the driving force behind economic development, but no‐one dares to add that this economic development needs to be balanced. Indeed, it is trite to point out that fundamental research is demanding ever greater investment, and that it therefore seems to have to be carried out by only a few small powerful teams associated with a very concentrated intellectual and industrial environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The demands of inter‐continental competition lead to the appearance of major industrial alliances, and public investment, especially European funding, is welcome in order to help these efforts. The principle of developing research effort should itself be seen as standing for the progress, competition and attractiveness of the most powerful zones of activity and consequently for concentration. Cohesion, on the other hand, stands for efforts towards prior redistribution in favour of the development of less favoured regions. These are thus two opposing principles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that research processes cannot themselves lead to convergence and that future convergence will be underpinned by autonomous development. The less favoured localities and regions should therefore create, with the help of the entire Union, an environment which is favourable to initiative and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity that we have is that instead of large‐scale fundamental research carried out by concentrated teams, today a whole world of intercommunication is appearing, which will facilitate networks of small research teams spread out across an entire territory. We must seize this opportunity. All European programmes must take part in the convergence of economies, and the framework research programme should not escape this objective, which is set out in the Treaties and was also highlighted at the Amsterdam summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication, the Commission has put together a few paths to take in order to reinforce both cohesion and competitiveness through research and innovation. The drafting of this communication, interesting though it may be, cannot, however, disguise the discussion that is going on in the Commission on this issue, which is similar to the debate that we could have on regional planning: is it really possible not to reduce the European effort towards competitiveness while at the same time directing research funds to the less favoured regions of the Union?</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, several studies show the worrying increase in imbalances between the regions, while the figures for gross domestic product per inhabitant in the Member States of the EU continue to show a residual convergence. There is in fact a certain discrepancy between national growth and regional cohesion, but even at state level the differences are extreme: in research and technological development expenditure, Germany and France, for example, spent 60 % of the total research expenditure in the Union in 1993, while Ireland, Greece and Portugal spent only 1.3 % between them. Whether it is the capacity to translate basic research into innovations, the number of patents per inhabitant, or staff employed in research and development, all these criteria reveal the extent of the disparities in technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the balance of European action in this respect? Let us note, for example, that a group of regions which includes the whole of Greece, with the exception of Attica, three Portuguese regions and Calabria in Italy, were only able to participate in 2 % of the third framework programme. It is true that since 1993 the Commission has endeavoured to encourage greater synergy between Community programmes and the objective of economic and social cohesion. We could also – and the Commission has thought about this – use Structural Funds more in order to correct the trend that has been observed. Nevertheless, the share of funding devoted under the various objectives of the Structural Funds to specific investment in favour of research and development has remained limited, even though it has increased from one programming period to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I propose to you to strongly press for a more balanced distribution of the key factors of competitiveness in the various regions of the Union through programmes to support research. This House can, in terms of the Commission communication, underline what seems to be the key objective, namely the development of innovation in the SMEs in the less favoured regions. The idea is to encourage innovation in all the small undertakings that have neither the resources, nor the skills, nor the time necessary to embark on innovation and integrate it into the practices adopted by the undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this type of development requires a well‐defined regional commitment, a close synergy between the fifth framework programme and the strategies adopted by the regions as cofinanced under the Structural Funds. It is also essential that we now fix the criteria for measuring progress in achieving the feasibility thresholds above which the spirit of innovation and competitiveness can be developed. Without this prior conceptual work, we will find it hard to act in the most efficient manner in order to ensure that these thresholds are achieved in the less favoured regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also call on the Commission to draw the full consequences from its correct observation that excellence in vocational training is of fundamental importance for the cohesion sought in this area. The only conclusion which the communication draws for the moment is that there is a need to promote vocational training courses in centres of excellence. We cannot stress the importance of human resources and then stop at such a weak conclusion. New funding mechanisms and boosting local policies for improving quality should at least be proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication provides an interesting basis for discussing a new way of approaching cohesion issues, but much remains to be done in order to clarify objectives, criteria and procedures.</p>

His report underscores the omissions and the wrong choices of the past which have impeded a speedier adjustment of the less‐favoured regions, which would have reduced the existing regional imbalances in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The enormous disparities in growth which still exist among the different regions of the European Union are in great part due to the huge divergencies in the technology sector, especially in investment in research and technological development. Details that are available paint a vivid picture of imbalances in the European Union, with discrepancies in technology being double the discrepancies in revenue. As we have heard, just two countries in the European Union, Germany and France, spend 60 % of the total available funds for research and technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we congratulate these countries on their capacity to absorb funds for research and technological development. However, we must also stress the need to fully integrate research and technological development into meeting the objective of economic and social cohesion and the reduction of regional imbalances, so as to achieve more balanced growth within the European Union. This can be done by strengthening the basic factors which shape competitiveness in the different regions of the European Union, and by increasing resources and support for attempts to make up for technological deficiencies, especially in the Objective 1 regions, where the problems of technological deficiencies are most pronounced.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a more integrated approach to the problems of growth during the new development period 2000‐2006 and, of course, more effective cooperation between the Structural Funds and the fifth framework programme for research and technological development. I believe that this must be one of the basic priorities for the new period of development. Finally, we all need to realise that cohesion is the ally of competitiveness and of the dynamism of our production system, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I agree with all the proposals contained in Mr de Lassus"s report and with the priority he has given to balanced support for the different regions of the European Union. I agree with the proposals he has put forward to assist small and medium‐sized enterprises and, above all, with the proposals to strengthen the links between research centres and universities by means of local vehicles for growth.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berend </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the creation of jobs in the European Union is one of our priorities, we must devote the utmost attention to research, technological development and innovation. As Christian Democrats, we are utterly convinced that competitiveness creates the safest jobs. Businesses that seek to remain or become competitive, however, cannot achieve that aim without sufficiently outstanding research and development and without innovating. It is true, as the Commission and the rapporteur have emphasised, that there are huge regional disparities in terms of research, technological development and innovation. Most research, of course, is conducted in regions with high levels of economic development, and far too little research, or indeed scarcely any, takes place in underdeveloped areas. That is a fact of life. Our efforts must be channelled into encouraging a continuous exchange of information between richer and poorer regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that cooperation should indeed take place between the research programmes and the Structural Funds. But a clear distinction must be made between the finances allocated to each. They are and will remain separate support mechanisms. That does not mean, however, that they cannot supplement each other or that they are in any way incompatible. In short, we are saying yes to cross‐pollination, but no to common funding. I can cite some successful examples of this approach from my own part of Germany, from Thuringia, which is an Objective 1 area. We have companies there which are household names in Germany and which have now established international reputations, such as Carl Zeiss Jena, Jen‐Optik or the Jena ovenproof glass company. The European Regional Development Fund has helped to create the infrastructure conditions for the success of these companies, which have also launched some excellent pioneering research and innovation projects with the aid of funds from the fourth framework programme for research and technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view, however, we cannot entirely endorse the rapporteur's proposal for Article 21, which is why we have requested a split vote on that article. I do wish to emphasise, however, that this should not detract from our general approval of the report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ahern</span> <span class="bold"> (V).</span> – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. A strange phenomenon is occurring in the European regions. While the figures for GDP per inhabitant reveal a residual growing convergence amongst the Member States, a process of rising imbalances between regions in the same state is taking place. In other words, there is a certain discrepancy between national growth and regional cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">An intelligent policy to disseminate technological innovation would be one of the skills to counteract this process of polarisation. Unfortunately, research and development are still a monopoly of the richest regions. In view of the sensitivities of this, the Greens have proposed three important points.</p>
<p class="contents">There should be more structural assistance for technological development instead of heavy infrastructures in the less‐favoured regions, especially in the Objective 1 regions. Secondly, we call for the application of a principle of positive discrimination in favour of the less‐favoured regions under the new RDT framework programmes. That means the allocation of resources under the framework programme should be made applying award criteria on the model of the structural funds allocation criteria. And thirdly, an orientation of technological innovation in the less‐favoured regions towards the promotion of sustainable development, promoting local skills and using local natural and human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have tabled an amendment introducing the principle of positive discrimination in R &amp; D for the poorer regions.</p>

In this connection, I feel that research and technological development are crucial to the development of geographical cohesion amongst the citizens of Europe. This does not of course mean that research and development ought to be distributed throughout Europe, but rather that specific policies should be put in place to promote activity where maximum benefit could be derived from technological development. This would usually be in the most advanced regions, those most advanced at European Union level and at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">Such regions are the real economic powerhouses and tend to be in a position to make a more effective contribution to the development of the other less favoured regions. The latter should not however be prevented from obtaining investment to improve their technological level and their competitiveness. Indeed, if they do not, cohesive development across the whole of the European Union will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur again because I do feel that this report has identified the main issues relating to the achievement not only of economic and social cohesion but also of geographical cohesion amongst all the regions of the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lage </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr de Lassus, although I do not want to preach a Ptolemaic view of science, which is always a temptation for modern western science, it is impossible nowadays to ignore the fact that knowledge, science and research are the real engines of both intellectual and economic progress in our societies. And in the face of enormous challenges from the United States, this is in danger of becoming the weakest link in the European Union. Whilst this is a fundamental challenge for the richer and scientifically better‐equipped countries and regions of the EU, it poses an even greater challenge for less‐favoured countries and regions: not as regards talent and creative capacity, because these are equally spread, but in terms of know‐how and technological innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Commission communication before us is to be welcomed in that it calls for greater Structural Fund spending on research and innovation, with a view to strengthening the weak scientific capacity and reinforcing the know‐how and technological bases of industries in these poorer regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the strategy proposed by the Commission suffers from one great flaw which is flagged up in the excellent report prepared by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, on which I would like to congratulate him. This flaw is that it does not take account of the need for more equitable distribution of resources available under the RTD framework programmes. I do not have in mind some kind of populist geographical dispersal of major themes and priorities in the framework programmes, far from it. But I would like to see some decentralisation away from the more exalted centres of research and technology towards more modest centres and towards smaller and more flexible teams based in poorer regions.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, although these framework programmes only represent 4 % of EU research expenditure, if spending under them were distributed more evenly, they could provide a powerful impetus for countries like Portugal, which up to now have been the poor relations of research and development in the European Union. Dissemination and absorption of scientific knowledge, technological progress and innovation should be one of the priorities of regional development and cohesion policy in the Europe of the future.</p>

He has hit the nail on the head there, because the large combines negotiate directly with the research centres in any event. Small and medium‐sized businesses are essentially in a difficult position. Our prime concern is to encourage innovation in those companies which are not large enough to devote time, money and human resources to deal systematically, and primarily on their own initiative, with innovative developments. It is a question of creating a real innovation culture among SMEs with a view to making European business competitive and safeguarding jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Any initiatives that will help to achieve this goal, especially those which encourage young entrepreneurs to invest in innovation, are particularly welcome. The most efficient approach would be to ensure that the largest possible slice of the budget for both the framework R&amp;D programme and the Structural Funds is devoted to this aim.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hatzidakis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, Mr de Lassus"s report raises a particularly important issue: how to promote cohesion and competitiveness in the European Union by supporting research, technological development and technological innovation. I believe it is important because, as we all understand, however many roads and railways we build, however many ports and airports we construct, however much we promote infrastructure, transport and the environment, research and technology represent an irreplaceable impetus for development. It is the quickest and most up‐to‐date road to growth. This growth will help the regions to help themselves and to create their own future, without the need to continuously struggle to keep up with the others.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, it is a sad fact that imbalances between the different regions regarding research and technology are much greater than in other sectors. According to Mr de Lassus"s report, they are many times greater than differences in revenue. For example, the difference in per capita expenditure on research and technological development between Berlin and Macedonia is, more or less, in the ratio of 1: 100. There is also a considerable problem of concentration of resources. Sixty‐eight per cent of people who are involved in the sectors of research, technology and technological innovation throughout Europe are based in just 10 % of the regions of the EU. These facts and figures may explain why, despite all the attempts to achieve cohesion which have been made over all these years, the differences in revenue among the regions continue to be huge and, in some cases, are becoming even larger.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise that research and technology are an important weapon in achieving cohesion and competitiveness in the EU, and this is why we must give them greater importance in the future. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the relevant Commission statement was issued after the drawing‐up of the fifth framework programme for research and technology, and that its conclusions could not be included in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, emphasis must be given to promoting research and technology in the less‐developed regions of the EU. I should like to take this opportunity to say that such actions must be given greater weight in the regional and structural policies of the EU during the next period, because this is the best, quickest and most far‐sighted way for these regions to achieve growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the best way of promoting employment, because it will generate steady, sustainable jobs in sectors with future prospects, and it will help small and medium‐sized enterprises to become the backbone and the major employers in this sector of production. However, Mr President, we must render unto Caesar that which is Caesar"s. This is not the responsibility of the Commission, it is the responsibility of the Member States to promote these actions during the new programming period. I should like to take my own country, Greece, as an example. Unfortunately, Greece lags behind the other 14 Member States in this sector. Our expenditure is just 0.63 % of GDP, when the Community average is 2.4 %. This is therefore an opportunity for us to use the new Community support framework to promote research and technology.</p>

This is the principle that businesses apply when they choose their locations. They prefer those central positions where the bulk of economic power is already concentrated, and then employees, educational establishments and infrastructure investment are drawn into these existing centres. Then we have phenomena like the Golden Arc or the Sunbelt on the one hand and the peripheral areas on the other, a scenario which calls for a regional policy to counteract this magnetism and prevent mass migration from the periphery to the main population centres. There are some especially effective ways of doing this. Research and technological development can be used to establish footholds in the hinterland, so that not only know‐how but also employment can develop outside the economic heartland and the main population centres.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy is convincingly presented by the communication from the Commission and by Mr de Lassus's report. My one wish is that the convincing words of both the communication and the report can be turned into action. One of my main interests relates to paragraph 15 of the report, which speaks of interregional and cross‐border cooperation, because it is especially important to break new ground in these areas. Already this evening we have spoken about educational cooperation in connection with the Socrates programme when we discussed the Pack report, and we expressed our gratification at the fact that European Union funds had paved the way for closer cooperation in the field of education in precisely those areas. I hope and wish for all of us, and particularly for the regions at the external frontiers of the Union where Interreg is trying to reverse the manpower drain, that the promises made to us in the Commission communication and the de Lassus report will be fulfilled in those regions, so that some birds will start flocking to places where none of their feather have gone before.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Chichester </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr de Lassus on his report. This is an important matter for my constituency of Devon and for my region of the South‐West and in particular for Cornwall, which the Commissioner will know has a very strong claim for Objective 1 status. There is a great deal of activity going on in the research field in our region already, which shows what can be achieved by way of generating local employment, not just at the universities of Exeter and Plymouth.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a very exciting project at a small town called Holsworthy where a plant to create energy from agricultural waste is being developed with assistance not only from a research project, the Altener programme, but also from Objective 5b funding. This is a good example of the synergy of regional and research funds coming together. The most important thing for remote regions of the Community is the information technology networks and the potential they have for drawing together researchers from far‐flung corners of Europe for mutual benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I am working at present on a report in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy for integrating environmental policy with energy policy. Here is a field where there is great potential for employment creation in the less‐favoured regions. There was a rather interesting project a while back for a prototype hybrid bus running on a battery in the city centre and normal diesel fuel in the outlying districts. This was another example of where funding from Europe can materially assist projects for employment and for environmental concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the emphasis in this report on small businesses. In my constituency in Devon small businesses and the self‐employed form a particularly large section of the economy. They are a vital generator both of jobs and of innovation and new projects. So I welcome giving emphasis to them in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say that we must beware of placing contracts for research work on geographical grounds alone. We must treat the merits of the project as the first priority. Otherwise we will damage the research work of the European Community.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Porto </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, there can be few initiatives with sound and important recommendations more relevant to Portugal, which is a unique case as a country with an ill‐balanced policy on the location of scientific and technological facilities, where balanced support would have an enormous effect.</p>
<p class="contents">As is highlighted in the Commission communication and in the report by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, technological development is a key factor in the internal development of less‐favoured regions and in reducing regional disparities. On the other hand, promoting technological development in just one or two already privileged areas, in line with centre‐periphery or cumulative effect theories, is bound to aggravate imbalances, negating the effect of any overall balance in expenditure on infrastructure and services. Although this might have social benefits, it would not have any effect as regards self‐sustaining developmental trends.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics on Portugal speak for themselves: 65 % of RTD funding, 82 % of state research and the lion's share of Community funding are concentrated in Lisbon. This means that there is no correlation with present levels of productive activity – the Lisbon area accounts for only 25 % of Portugal's industrial GDP and an insignificant percentage of the country's agricultural and forestry GDP. Nor is there any correlation with potential levels of activity, not to mention the social and political benefits that some if not all would see in balanced regional development of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">A well‐balanced spread of support close to existing and potential users would also ensure that the needs of Portugal – or of any other country – are met, whilst promoting a wider spread of company expenditure, which is also desirable. This would involve a different approach to that of the present major laboratories, which are remote from most economic activity. I believe we should build upon the positive experience of technological centres sited at appropriate locations in the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done, we are talking about complying with the Maastricht Treaty, which clearly stipulates that support should be given to universities, research centres and to SMEs. I believe that this approach is correct and that it should be adopted throughout the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wulf‐Mathies, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr de Lassus for this highly significant report and the motion for a resolution. I am delighted to note that Parliament agrees with the main thrust of our communication, and it should be appreciated that this is the first time we have tried to release the synergy between these two policies, as you have rightly been urging us to do, and to achieve closer coordination of our common research and development policy with our structural and cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We share your view that research, technological development, innovation and modernisation of the production basis are essential means of creating steady jobs and reducing regional disparities. That is why, in the draft guidelines for the next structural programme, covering the period from 2000 to 2006, which it adopted on 2 February, the Commission reaffirms the approach that is also clearly outlined in the present communication. The competitiveness of a region is crucially dependent on whether or not it possesses an innovation strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the guidelines for the next period of the Structural Funds, the Commission therefore recommends to the regions a whole raft of measures designed to encourage innovation, from new forms of funding, such as venture capital to promote business start‐ups and innovative developments, to specialised services and facilities for technology transfer. The contributions to the present debate have further emphasised the fact that the transfer of knowledge and know‐how and the dissemination of new techniques represent a vital contribution to the enhancement of regional competitiveness. For that reason, the guidelines state that payments from the Structural Funds should primarily help small and medium‐sized businesses to acquire the skills they need in order to go on developing, but they should also be used to set up cooperative ventures and centres where knowledge and skills can be pooled and to fund involvement in Community and international research and innovation networks, not forgetting the business innovation centres and the various European networks through which we have already done a great deal to enable small and medium‐sized businesses to benefit from the results of research conducted by other bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to your criticism of the fifth framework programme for research and technological development, let me say that this programme, as you know, was the result of two years of negotiation with Parliament and with the Member States, and that the framework programme is not primarily concerned with cohesion, but also focuses on the competitiveness of Europe as a global region in terms of leading‐edge technology, which naturally implies that one of its aims is to enable Europe to compete with the United States and Japan. So the key point is that in pursuing the one aim, we do not neglect the other, and above all that we ensure not only that the development of research, particularly in the field of leading‐edge technology, benefits the poorer regions directly but also that exchanges of researchers, which will be supported under the fifth framework R&amp;D programme, can be used to promote innovation in the structurally weaker regions.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at some of the elements of the fifth framework programme – at the development of human resources potential in the field of research, or at the improvement of the socio‐economic knowledge base – if you consider the Marie Curie homecoming grants for researchers from underprivileged regions and if you examine the development grants for research establishments in underdeveloped areas, you will see that the fifth framework programme responds to many of the needs of structurally weak regions and that its subject areas, such as the sustainable management of water supplies and water quality, sustainable agriculture, forestry and fisheries, rural areas, the town of tomorrow and the cultural heritage, are all of particular importance to regional development. The same applies, of course, to objectives such as the promotion of innovation and the involvement of small and medium‐sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has already indicated, we have made progress over the last ten years, not least in terms of funding. We started in 1988 with 200 million, and we now have 8.5 billion allocated to the Structural Funds for research and technology. It also has to be said here, of course, and I am grateful to Mr Hatzidakis for pointing this out too, that the Commission is not solely responsible, but that the Member States must also do more to ensure that such projects are included in their programmes. In a recent Objective 1 evaluation, we observed that more money spent on research and innovation does not automatically mean more innovation. In the cohesion countries in particular, the public sector is still largely overrepresented, while business innovations do not receive their fair share of funding, which is why I believe it is very important to put greater emphasis on the latter, because it is absolutely crucial that the regions themselves should be able to devise their own innovation strategies, which would be the best way to ensure that due account is taken of specific regional circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why initiatives such as the regional information society initiative, in which the regions cooperate – across national borders, incidentally – and exchange best practices in the field of innovation support, are so important. That is why it is also important that the innovation dimension should become a more integral part of interregional and cross‐border cooperation. Parliament and the Commission are, I believe, on the right path, but I agree with the rapporteur when he concludes that there is still a considerable way to go before we can say that the poorer regions have really started to bridge the gap in research and innovation, as well as in other areas.</p>
