<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost ten years after the signing of the Treaty of Maastricht, the euro has now found its way into our pockets and, I think, into the hearts of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The operations to introduce the euro that have taken place in these first two weeks have gone extraordinarily well. Our most optimistic expectations have been more than satisfied. Europe’s citizens have acted enthusiastically and responsibly, and all the operators involved in the changeover have shown themselves to be dedicated and meticulous.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into circulation of the euro on 1 January 2002 is the culmination of a project on which we have been working for many years. Our fellow citizens feel that European integration is making very slow progress. Taking the historical view, however, we can see that it is actually moving ahead at great speed. The Member States took ten centuries to achieve monetary unification in their territories and the Community has done the same in little more than 40 years.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, I should like to pay tribute to the men and women who made the success of this project possible. There are many, and mention has been made this morning of some of them. I am not going to repeat their names, which are fresh in everyone’s mind, but the project has – if I may put it this way – not only fathers but also mothers, and I should like to make specific mention of these women by referring to one individual: Christa Randzio-Plath, who embodies the involvement and the commitment to the euro of this Parliament and of her Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would be unfair, however, if I did not mention two other Members of this Parliament: Karl von Wogau, who, in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, also played a critical role, and the previous President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer. I should also like to mention my predecessor, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who played a crucial role in the previous legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked effectively together with Parliament and I hope that we can continue to do so when confronting new challenges in the task ahead of us. This is why I should like to say that the introduction of euro notes and coins is not only the culmination of a project. It is also the beginning of a new era in the history of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The physical reality of the euro affords us the opportunity to make further progress in the process of integration. I shall refer to this later on and I should like to focus now on more critical aspects of these early days of the changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to highlight the enthusiasm of Europe’s citizens towards their new currency. This has undoubtedly been a crucial factor in the success of the operation. The citizens of Europe have rapidly integrated the euro into their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Before of the first of January, the sale of currency kits had already been a success. From the first of January, consumers began using notes on a massive scale. The volumes of withdrawals from ATMs were higher than expected from the first days onwards. The amount of business taking place at bank counters was so great during the first week of January that, in some countries, the volume of withdrawals or exchanges in banks was greater than the volume of operations at ATMs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another indicator of the success of the single currency amongst the public has been the rapid progress of payments in euros. These had already reached 20% on 2 January, the first working day. Today – that is to say, only nine days later – nine out of ten payments are being made in euros. The operation has been a success, therefore, given that over 90% of these transactions are taking place in euros after two weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment on the adaptation of automatic cash machines is that this has also been swift and has taken place throughout the euro zone. For the last two years, the Commission and the European Central Bank have asked banks to change their plans and adapt ATMs with almost immediate effect. This course of action has been a success. On average, 80% of ATMs were adapted by the first of January. This figure rose to 90% by 2 January and to 97% by 3 January. By 4 January, almost all ATMs were only issuing euros.</p>
<p class="contents">A comment on business: the majority of citizens have sought primarily to get rid of their national currencies and receive change in euros, thereby demonstrating their desire to use only the euro as quickly as possible. By and large, businesses respected their commitment to give change in euros, which enabled the existing stock of the former currencies to be disposed of rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">The acceleration of payments in euros together with the exceptional measures adopted by the majority of businesses meant that queues in shops were not as long as they could have been. Saturday 5 January was the key day for this issue. The test was conclusive and in all participating States, queues were of normal length. This situation did not change on the following Monday, when sales began in many European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the first week of January was extremely complicated for business. On the one hand, the frontloading of businesses turned out to be inadequate or encountered logistical problems in some Member States. On the other hand, many consumers spent money in order to get rid of high denomination notes from the national currency, which soon created problems with the supply of lower-value notes in a number of the States participating in the operation, a situation that was resolved by one means or another.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the behaviour of prices, an issue to which the Commission decided to draw the attention of the Member States and all players in the changeover in the months leading up to the first of January, I can tell you that, according to the reports submitted to us by the national authorities responsible, there has been no significant increases in prices as a consequence of the changeover to the euro, with the exception of a few isolated incidents. Furthermore, in some cases there have been downward adjustments, although, it is also fair to say, in other cases and on an individual basis, the opposite may have occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall – I repeat – there has been no significant increase in prices and we do not, therefore, expect to see a negative impact on inflation for the month of January.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the balance sheet for these two first weeks is, in the opinion of the Commission, very positive. The greatest exchange operation in history has taken place practically without mishap. It is a huge triumph for the Union and proof of the high quality of our meticulous preparations. The efforts of all key players in the transition to the euro: the eurosystem, national governments, the Commission, private operators and all citizens have borne fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the introduction of the euro is the end of a chapter – as I said before – but not the end of the work. We must now harvest the fruits of this success by increasing and deepening the coordination of our economic policies and by undertaking the structural reforms necessary to increase growth and employment in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now apply the same energy and ambition that have guided the introduction of the euro to achieving the coordination of economic policies which will enable us to increase growth and employment. In the short term, the framework of stability in the euro zone has enabled us to provide a balanced and timely response to the economic slowdown we are currently experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">The clear improvement in budget revenues has created some leeway, which will help to cushion the impact of the slight increase in budget deficits that have appeared as a result of the global slowdown.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002 we hope to regain a satisfactory level of growth, which will contribute to global economic recovery. The success of the introduction of euro notes and coins will, by eliminating uncertainty, assist this recovery, stimulating consumer and business confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium term, the European Union set itself clear objectives in Lisbon for increasing the potential for growth and for job creation. In order to achieve these objectives, it is important that we maintain the impetus that will enable us to carry out the necessary reforms which will, in turn, bring about an increase in the rates of employment and productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">For this year, the Commission proposes three priority areas: first of all employment policies and, in particular, active labour market policies; secondly, economic reforms to increase competitiveness, integration and investment in key industries; and thirdly, investing in knowledge to increase competitiveness and employment. I shall not dwell any longer on these points, which were yesterday the subject of the speech by the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater interdependence of the economies of the Member States, and in particular within the euro zone, calls for closer and more effective coordination of these economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would say that coordination must be strengthened on the basis of a more accurate analysis of the economic situation and the policy mix of the euro zone. There must be greater openness in reaching consensus on appropriate policies and the Member States and the Commission must be given access to information on the principal measures of economic policy that each country will adopt in future so that the peer review system that we have within the Community can function effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving ahead means meeting our commitments: those in the Treaty and those in the Stability and Growth Pact. Moving ahead also means facing up to new challenges. This is what we, as the Commission, will be focussing our efforts and our work on and we hope we will be able to count on the cooperation of Parliament that we have always enjoyed, and with which we hope to continue working in the same efficient and consensual way that we have in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been a member of this Committee for 22 years. From tomorrow, I shall be a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I am convinced that the next step on the road to the realisation of the European Union must be political union. I look forward to working on this task in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back over these years, I would like to start by recalling our colleague Basil de Ferranti, now sadly deceased, who at that time drafted the first reports on the creation of the internal market and thereby initiated this whole development. It started off as a working party on technical barriers to trade, later spawning the Kangaroo Group. These were the first initiatives towards creating the internal market. Jacques Delors was at that time the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in other words, Mrs Randzio-Plath, our predecessor; he then, as French Finance Minister and later as President of the European Commission, laid the foundations on which these ideas were to become realities.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish also to recall Jacques Moreau who, together with me back then in 1984, presented the first report of the European Parliament on proposals for the creation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Seeing the enthusiasm that greeted the euro on 1 January, welcoming this new currency for 300 million people in the European Union, we have to recall, on the one hand, how difficult was the road to this. On the other hand, though, we also have to ask ourselves what conditions are required for the euro, our common currency, to be successful in the long term?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me here list three conditions. The first is the consistent development of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is indeed almost ironic that we see today that it was Germany, my homeland, that campaigned most vigorously then for this Stability and Growth Pact with its strict criteria, and that one can, or must, almost take it for granted in the present situation that Germany will be the first country to be affected by this treaty's sanctions. I take the view, though, that we must be consistent here if we want the euro to become and remain a stable currency in the long term and interest rates in the European Union to remain low in the long term for our enterprises, as a condition of investment and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The second condition is that, in the Member States and in the EU, we make economic policy in accordance with principles held in common. It was by a large majority the will of Parliament that these principles should be those of the social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must move forward to political union. We said before Maastricht that we wanted monetary union and political union at the same time. Even then we were saying that monetary union cannot exist in the long term without political union. We must stay consistent on this point. It is now that we must take these steps to political union, at the core of which is a common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, finally, to pick up on something Jacques Delors said. Jacques Delors, during the interminable debates we had on the European internal market, once remarked, and quite rightly, that you could not fall in love with an internal market. In other words, there is very little emotion involved. I would also say that the same applies to a currency, although there are some of us who have a very emotional, almost erotic, relationship with the currency. What we need, though, and what we must bring to light, is the awareness of a common European identity, Europe-consciousness.

Not even Eurosceptics in Italy can do anything about that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The tangible euro makes Europe a fact of daily life, just as we MEPs always said it would. The euro was, in a manner of speaking, Parliament's first choice since it was itself directly elected, a choice above all by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs To that extent, the euro has for two decades been one of Parliament's successful projects. We took our stand for a market and a currency and played our part in creating them. I think that thanks are owed to all the Members of this House, and to you too, Mr von Wogau.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">‘Euro’ will in my view become the affirmative word of 2002. After all, the euro embodies Europe's dynamism and determination to create a European identity, improve European competitiveness for the benefit of the economy and employment and grow together into permanent mutual solidarity. Monetary union completes the internal market – the right answer to the challenges of globalisation – and makes it at last work for everyone, for small and medium-sized enterprises and above all for people.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro will become a success because it is accepted not only by the markets but also by people. Many are at last rejoicing – as we Members always predicted they would – to be living in Euroland. The success of the introduction of euro notes and coins fills everyone with enthusiasm and creates the climate of optimism that we in Europe urgently need for investment, stimulation of internal demand and thus for employment. The introduction of euro notes and coins crowns and rewards the sustained efforts on the road towards monetary union. Today, many people are already wondering why euro notes and coins had not been introduced much earlier, something we Members had always demanded. We call upon Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain to come into the eurozone in their own interest before eastward enlargement takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">The German mark was a currency with a proud past. Three years of monetary union promise us an equally stable monetary future. There have in any case been lower interest rates under monetary union than in the decades of the German mark that preceded it. This is connected with the low level of interest, which guarantees good financial conditions that favour investment. It follows that monetary union has kept to what was promised politically in the Maastricht Treaty, namely price stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of euro notes and coins, then, also brings visible successes for consumers: prices for consumer durables, such as cars, will fall. By its completion of the internal market programme, the euro also at last makes possible consumer-friendly competition, which will lead to medium-term pressure on prices and an incentive to higher quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The completion of economic and monetary union, of the internal reform of the European Union and of a European constitution and the successful eastward enlargement of the EU are the great challenges that Europe must face up to. There is one thing, though, that we must not forget: the euro is not only a monetary project; it was always a political project and is a component of the political union of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is small in global terms, and so the internal market, completed by monetary union, is quite certainly the right answer. The euro, moreover, puts to the test the ability of Europeans to organise unity in the interests of all Europe's states. As far as further bold European projects are concerned, it is both a connecting link between them and a stumbling block.</p>
<p class="contents">William Shakespeare was right to maintain that ‘if money go before, all ways do lie open’. It is to be hoped that that applies also to more efficient and improved coordination of economic, financial, employment and social security policies. The euro urgently needs to be accompanied by some sort of economic government. Cyclic developments are no longer triggered by nation states, but by economic issues, and so the EU summit in Barcelona has been required to exchange dogmatism in handling the Stability and Growth Pact, which does leave some room to manoeuvre, for a sound policy which is committed to monetary, financial and also social stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment as a Parliament to monetary dialogue with the European Central Bank was particularly important. We took our stand in Parliament for the independence of the European Central Bank, but also demonstrated our commitment to that institution's democratic accountability. Hence it is very important that we should have organised and motivated a cultural revolution in Europe, for the Member States' dealings with the national central banks used not to have the democratic accountability we have now. Money policy thus becomes transparent and comprehensible and helps us to fathom this mystery as well. For money policy is not neutral; it too has an influence on the real economy, on growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 1 January, many European citizens made their first acquaintance with the new currency: the euro. And what an acquaintance that was. Barely two weeks have passed and the euro has replaced the national currencies everywhere. If Parliament’s wish to distribute euro notes among the public before 1 January had been complied with, a few smaller problems might have been avoided, but that is probably just a detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more that the changeover has been a runaway success. This is mainly due to the citizens of Europe, a fact to which you yourself have already made reference, as befits a good Liberal. They have reacted to the currency change with enthusiasm and patience. Shopkeepers should also be praised. They have borne the burden of the actual implementation and, in my view, they are therefore the heroes of the conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion, the introduction of the euro notes and coins is merely a first step, and Commissioner Solbes Mira has already made reference to this. What matters most now is to ensure that the new currency continues to be successful. This requires quite a bit from all participating countries: the political will to support the currency and not to cast it in a bad light, as some members of the Italian government have done, the political courage to leave the Stability Pact intact so that the correct financial framework of the euro continues to exist, and the political power to build on the success of the euro. The time has come therefore, following the most successful European project ever, to take steps in order to further develop the internal market. If we really want to achieve the objectives prescribed in Lisbon, we must commit ourselves to the further liberalisation of the internal market and to making it more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are five clear priorities in this respect, namely postal services, transport, electricity, gas and water. These are vital in the liberalised and flexible knowledge-based economy that we are pursuing in Europe, and also in the interests of the citizen. In this way, the citizens know where they stand with Europe. Only by choosing this option can the EU’s economic power be realised and the new currency kept strong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The markets, which always have the choice, appear to be much less enthusiastic. In any case, I believe that the people will use price levels as the true factor that determines whether or not they will adopt the Euroland currency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this currency, which does not belong to any one State, is now posing new problems. Shopkeepers have already had to carry out, free of charge, the work of the banks during the introduction of the euro. It is conceivable that, during this period, shopkeepers had the same interest as consumers in doing this. But now the problem of counterfeiting has surfaced. Forged notes are already at large and it is easy to envisage the different currencies of north and south Euroland intermingling this summer. For example, the EUR 200 and EUR 500 notes, which were not printed in France and in the countries of southern Europe, will reach us, which is in fact already happening with notes of German origin. Next summer, these notes will be everywhere. Obviously, shopkeepers are unable to identify potential forgeries which are worth, if you will forgive me for saying so, more than 3 500 of our poor old francs, in other words, half the minimum wage in France. The Commission will be responsible for compensating the victims and those misled by forged euro, since no State can be. But will the European citizens and the shopkeepers, who accept forged currency by mistake and because they are unable to tell the difference, be compensated by Member States or by the European Central Bank? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr von Wogau said that the next stage would be political union. I agree, but I feel it would be a mistake to think that the success of the euro, its capacity to be a strong, stable, reliable currency lies in political union, which is necessary for other reasons. The euro will be a strong currency if Europe’s economy is strong.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mentioned the need to coordinate economic policies several times in your speech. I feel that there is something which is even more important than coordinating economic policies, which, if we overdo it, could even have negative repercussions. It is important for there to be sound economic policies in Europe: the strength of the euro will depend on it. We must combine<span class="bold"> </span>the<span class="bold"> </span>transparent policies and get away from the present rigidity. The strength of the euro, then, will depend on the ability of these transparent policies to make the economic systems more dynamic – as Mr Maaten said – to free them from the constraints of corporatism and <span class="italic">dirigisme</span>, to liberalise the markets, etc. All this is often the result of too little rather than too much economic policy and, in this respect, I feel that the tension between policies, the competition between the many different solutions adopted by the countries is of benefit and, through a form of <span class="italic">bona fide</span> benchmarking, can foster positive processes of emulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it does need some fine-tuning, the framework of the single market, together with the Stability Pact – an economic Constitution which many countries like Italy did indeed lack – is broad enough to be able to embrace, without conflict or contradiction, a transparent range of options between which it is left to the individual countries to decide. I believe that leaving the Member States the leeway to choose between options within the framework of the single market will lead to a stronger economy and that, as a result, the conditions necessary for a stronger single currency will emerge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘euro introduction’ project has been a success. In the Netherlands and in Ireland, the introduction of the euro is practically completed. More than 90% of all payments are already conducted in euros. Mrs Peijs is proud – and I could not agree more – that European citizens have so quickly adopted the euro with such a great sense of innovation and have put their own currencies to one side.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europeans did not need long changeover periods. Today, we undoubtedly owe a special word of thanks and recognition to the retail trade, which has absorbed a whole host of difficulties with appropriate flexibility. The banks and their staff have also contributed a great deal to the smooth transition. We must now take an important next step. The euro must remain a stable and strong currency. For that purpose, the President of the Central Bank must first and foremost remain where he is and must closely monitor the bank’s objectives, namely low inflation. It is almost more important for the Member States to start to realise that they are not on their own and are not fully autonomous, but that everything they do, and notably what they do not do, has a bearing on the entire Community and on the stability of the currency.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to sustain the confidence of the markets, it is very important for the large Member States in particular – and perhaps notably Germany – at long last to take the necessary measures to open up their markets completely, to make their labour markets more flexible, to make their pension systems sustainable and to modernise their social benefits. Instead of being the Union’s driving force, these countries act more as a brake on the Union’s progress. Any weakness in the currency is down to the Member States and so far not to the Central Bank, which is operating exceptionally well, except in the field of payment balance systems, such as TARGET, and the consumer system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will use the short amount of time available to me to concentrate on the second aspect, for the euro really is an open door to the future. Indeed, I feel that, in addition to its great symbolic significance, the introduction of the euro will not bring immediate short-term effects for our economy or in terms of the rate of inflation; however I do feel that it provides Europe with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a climate of stability, particularly as regards the medium and long term. In the medium term, Europe has the problem of how to disengage its economy from the US cycle. Indeed, still today, European development is heavily influenced by exports and, therefore, to a great extent by US demand. This being the case, the current recession in the United States could impact on us rather than be offset by our capacity for independent growth. This capacity for development of internal demand can benefit greatly from the integration of monetary policy, but it does not depend on this alone. It needs to be boosted by an economic policy which combines monetary policy with fiscal policy and, most importantly, with a policy of research and innovative investment such as that outlined at Lisbon, although this policy has not actually been pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem exists in the longer term of the euro as a potential world-wide reserve currency on an equal footing with the dollar. A Parliamentary resolution has already pointed out that the central guideline for the exchange policy should not be a strong or weak euro but a stable euro, varying, of course, within a range in a way that is not destabilising. To this end, it will be necessary, sooner or later, to promote some form of agreement between the US and European monetary policies for our mutual and shared benefit. It is true, then, that the euro does represent a major opportunity, but it is an opportunity which has not yet been exploited. This potential role – as the previous speakers have said too – must be fully realised by politics, by Europe’s political capacity, by a government responsible for the economy which promotes the conditions for autonomous development within Europe and which ensures effective management of exchange outside Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to official reports, no problems have marred its triumphant arrival. Fifteen days after the euro’s introduction, the evidence is for all to see: the great majority of transactions are being made in euro.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it bluntly, these crude propaganda-driven reports are very wide of the mark. Nothing has really worked as planned. There was a shortage of euro in the first days, banks refused to do their work by refusing to carry out currency exchanges or by placing a limit on them, and, to top it all, by trying to charge for the transaction. Cash dispensers cannot issue EUR 20 notes, vending machines are refusing to accept euros produced in another country and the opportunities for counterfeiters are increasing because no one knows how to identify the new notes. We have to admit it: European citizens are not using the euro out of enthusiasm, but under duress because it is increasingly difficult to get hold of their national currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Germans, for whom there is no transition period, are continuing to pay in deutschmarks even though this currency ceased to be legal tender on 1 January.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no advantage, therefore, to using the euro for everyday purchases. It only causes difficulties and is costly to everyone, not to mention that its introduction has meant States have had to abandon their sovereignty unnecessarily. Everyone in Europe now has a foreign currency and we are also seeing a return to rising prices. Everyone realises, when doing their shopping, that prices are soaring, everywhere and in highly worrying proportions, particularly for everyday goods and essential items.</p>
<p class="contents">This is perhaps not quite the same as the Ruhr of the 1920s but this is similar to what happened in the 1970s. January’s price index may be saved by the sales but let us wait for the figures for the whole year. Let us also wait for the first anti-social effects of competition, which the euro will have on salaries, relocations and redundancies, to be felt. Therefore, in the name of the right of nations to self-determination, we would like to affirm the right of nations to bring back their national currency, in the same way that the former Soviet states, when freed from the yoke of Soviet federalism, brought back theirs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, President Prodi told us this morning that the introduction of euro notes and coins was a huge success. And several Members have gone even further by speaking of the enthusiasm of consumers, who appear to have embraced the new currency.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, these comments are excessive. It is true that the changeover to euro notes and coins was well executed, technically speaking, but the consumers had no other choice than, sooner or later, to use the new money. The real test will be that of managing the euro in the years to come. And, in this respect, if I were a federalist, I would not be pleased. I would be rather concerned, because, today, the people who occupy a very difference position to us on the political stage, such as Jacques Delors, are saying exactly what we have always said, namely that the euro cannot function as it is. We should speed up integration, as Mr Prodi said. We should strengthen the economic pillar or move towards a political Europe, as other Members are saying. In short, we need more supranational power to integrate at European level; in other words, that Europe is turned into more of a super-State.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the rub, Mr President. Is Europe prepared to accept this super-State? No, it is not! First of all, the nations of Europe are sufficiently diverse in every respect that it is not possible to create an optimal monetary zone. Some of our Members will certainly say that a super-State with the power to ensure consistency is all the more necessary. Yes, admittedly, it might be all the more necessary, but at the same time, it is all the more impossible. So this is the vicious circle in which the euro zone countries will struggle over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">You could also say that it is a race against time. For the euro to work, either those who oversee it will fairly soon manage to pull apart the nations and build the super-State – and then the euro can survive, but what state will Europe and democracy be in? – or the nations, simply because of their differences, will make it impossible to manage the single currency. As for us, it is clear what we prefer, Mr President, out of an affection for our homelands and because of our belief in the fundamental need for a national framework for democracy and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there not a third option, however, that of a single currency without a State? This could appeal to us, but no one actually knows how it would work if confronted with asymmetric shocks. Furthermore, the markets themselves do not believe in it, as proven by the persistent weakness of the euro in recent days. </p>
<p class="contents">The euro, then, is launching us into an adventure with very serious political and financial consequences of which the citizens were not warned in advance and which they are not prepared to shoulder. It should really be the people who invented the euro who are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coming from a country which is out, and a party which opposes joining, I was half expecting more glitches and popular resentment at the imposition of an unfamiliar currency. So far so good, with little inflationary rounding-up. I congratulate the ECB, the Commission and the national central banks on their handling of the logistics of this massive undertaking without any upsurge in armed robbery or counterfeiting, although I still question the need for a EUR 500 note which can only facilitate criminality.</p>
<p class="contents">The naturally cautious British Conservative position is that, although the euro may be an added convenience to travellers and improve price transparency in the single market, it is undoubtedly intended primarily to bolster pan-European identity as a stepping stone to further political integration – something admitted to by everybody bar Mr Blair and our Labour Government – and to control not only of monetary policy, but also of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">The "one size fits all" monetary policy, as the Commission's pessimistic 2001 economic report admits, cannot be right for all of the countries all of the time and, coupled with the fiscal restraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, imposes severe destabilising problems and a lack of flexibility on certain economies, as we have already seen in the artificial boom scenario of Ireland. The risks of an asymmetric shock developing will only get bigger after enlargement as European labour markets remain unreformed and largely immobile. President Prodi has admitted this inherent risk and the call will come very shortly for a much bigger EU budget and direct EU taxes to set up bail-out funds to compensate affected countries for their loss of rights to devalue their currencies or lower their interest rates. Nevertheless, I wish the euro well as the currency of our major trading partners, since UK prosperity is also affected by its stability.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that my pessimistic prognosis, which echoes that of the Commission's own, proves to be wrong over time. I would also like confirmation from Commissioner Solbes that, in his opinion, for the UK to join the euro it will have to spend at least two years locked into the ERM II phase first before proceeding. Finally, I should like to congratulate you, Mr President, on your election. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to begin by giving special thanks to Karl von Wogau for his involvement in this process over the last 22 years. We are sorry to see him leave the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but we know that his skills will continue to help Parliament and the process of European integration in the Committee of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Karl von Wogau said, in a reference to Jacques Delors, that it is impossible to fall in love with the euro, and yet Christa Randzio-Plath said that Europe’s citizens are happy. Both comments might be linked to one fundamental factor: the euro is the first aspect of European identity to affect all citizens of the Member States of the Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro is extremely important, as were the removal of borders or the internal market, which, nevertheless, only affect goods and citizens crossing the border at a given time, but it is also a piece of our European identity, which we use every day from morning till night, in all the countries of the Monetary Union and exactly in the same conditions. Because there are clearly also striking differences between us, this aspect, out of all our common aspects, must be highlighted as a very positive one, as the others have nothing to do with any form of unification.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, the euro will give us notes and coins and a slight increase in economic growth, as a consequence of uncertainties being eliminated. It is true, however, and I am in agreement on this with some of the speakers, that the fundamental elements will emerge as a result of our potential capacity for growth or, to put it another way, as a result of implementing the Lisbon process in a more ambitious way than we have done so far.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be able to break free from the United States, as Mr Ruffolo suggests we would want to do. Nevertheless, experience and the year 2001 have shown us that being relatively independent in terms of trade does not protect us from the effects of a crisis in the United States as a consequence of the course which takes place due to the economic effects arising from the relationships between companies and between financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The exchange rate will be the real test of the euro. I have always said that the exchange rate was never an objective of the Union’s policy. Our objective for monetary policy is to maintain low inflation and we are convinced that a currency with low inflation is, in the long term, a stable currency, a popular currency, a currency that will provide refuge and is a currency that will have an important role to play in the economic world.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the purely economic aspects, however, what is happening with our institutional structure? Is the euro the beginning of economic government? I would say that the model we put together in Maastricht was based on a single monetary policy and on coordinated national economic policies. This is our model. And we have to work on ensuring that the euro is a success on this basis. I am not going to prejudge whether we should make more or less progress in the processes of political integration. It could be done according to the wishes of those that favour greater political integration, but I also realise that this is a decision to be taken by the fifteen Member States in other bodies, in other forums and following a different debate. Nevertheless, I am convinced that we can move ahead with the process of greater coordination between economic policies, which certainly does not mean the unification of our economic policies, because our situations are different and, consequently, policies must be applied consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, like so often before, we have tended to confuse stability pacts with economic policy guidelines. Is the Stability Pact the problem for the Union’s economic policy? This is something we have discussed on more than one occasion in this House. I repeat what I have always said: the Stability Pact is nothing more and nothing less than a necessary factor which allows us to maintain a policy mix between budgetary policy and monetary policy, which facilitates a monetary policy with low rates of interest. Structural changes to our economies and the move towards growth, coherence between our national economic policies and Union policy as a whole with monetary policy must be managed by means of these broad economic policy guidelines. We have the necessary instruments; we have to perfect and improve them, but I think that the system is a good one. The policy mix will be one of the key elements of the Spanish Presidency, as the chairman of Ecofin stressed and I am sure we will have the opportunity in this House to debate this fundamental point. Of course, the structural reforms, as I said earlier, are still the key to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a comment on enlargement of the euro zone. We have noted greater interest in the ‘pre-in’ countries in what is happening in our experience in the euro zone. Or rather, I would say that in the three ‘pre-in’ countries, considerable further interest has been aroused, which is reflected in some political attitudes that have been communicated or which we have seen in recent days. Admittedly, there are still some who criticise the euro and what some people in the Eurosceptic world are afraid of, since the short term problems have not occurred, is what will happen in ten or fifteen years’ time. Obviously, there is nothing we can say on this point. It is difficult to control what will happen in ten or fifteen years’ time, but I personally am convinced that by then we will have far fewer problems than we do at the moment in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">What conditions will be imposed on the ‘pre-in’ countries in order for them to join the Union? Exactly the same as those imposed on the other countries, no more and no less. Compliance with the Maastricht criteria, with the additional factor of the <span class="italic">opt-out</span> clause to which Denmark and the United Kingdom have the right. There will be no change either for the ‘pre-in’ or for the candidate countries. We take the view that the equal treatment of all Member States of the Union is a fundamental principle, which we should not alter under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">A last comment on an issue that might be a minor one but which is, to a certain extent, the issue that has concerned us today: the practical problems involved in the introduction of the euro. Have businesses played the role of the bankers? No, they have not. Through the system of frontloading, businesses have acted as an incentive for the rapid take-up of the single currency. It is true that some practical problems have occurred, due more to pressure by some citizens to use businesses as a bank, when they have tried to change high denominations of national currency in businesses and not in the banks, as should have been predicted.</p>
<p class="contents">Have there been serious problems of counterfeiting? There have been neither serious nor less serious problems in this area. So far, we have not seen counterfeits that could technically be called ‘counterfeit euros’. There have been photocopies. There have been euros produced with scanners, but which are enormously different from the real euro and, consequently, these concerns, which are occasionally expressed, should no longer be an issue. The euro has an extremely high security factor, unlike some of the world’s other national high circulation currencies, and this should guarantee that this type of situation is not going to occur.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also deny the truth of some of the assertions made about the functioning of ATMs. There have indeed been practical problems. Anyone who goes to automated toll booths machines not far from here will see that some machines do not work with the currencies of every Union country. These are practical problems, whose importance we should not exaggerate: they are merely anecdotes within an enormously important and complex process.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I feel that there are major pricing problems or that prices in the sales will influence prices in January, as they have not done in the past, since they have never been taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, speaking with the former chairman of Ecofin, Mr Reynders, we said that the clear lesson we have learned from this process is that the next time we change currency we must not do it on the first of January. But since I am sure that this situation will not arise, I would say that we have no need to worry about this problem either.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for your immense cooperation during this period. It has been crucial to helping the good work of the Member States, to ensuring that the public has been better informed and also to providing encouragement for the Commission’s work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
