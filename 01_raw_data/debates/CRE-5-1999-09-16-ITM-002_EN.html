<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – (<span class="italic">DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about a Reconstruction Agency for South-East Europe whose first operational Agency is to be opened in Pristina, Kosovo. Unlike other institutions in Europe, we have learned a lesson from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We want efficiency right from the start, and this ought not to be compromised from the beginning because the decisions are being taken a long way away. We learned this in Bosnia, and the warning has not been lost on us. Mr Schwaiger, the last rapporteur at OBNOVA, stipulated this for Bosnia at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore attach a lot of importance to having the Agency which is to manage the reconstruction in Kosovo situated in Pristina. I concede, however, that it is a part of the large Reconstruction Agency for the whole of the western Balkans, and for South-East Europe, which will have its headquarters in Thessaloniki. I shall come back to this question of the Agency’s location and everything connected with it, as well as to the question of its efficiency. </p>
<p class="contents">What ought this Agency to be doing now in Kosovo? It is to carry out reconstruction on-site, but it is not responsible for only the bricks and mortar. It is also responsible for re-establishing constitutional relationships. It is responsible for rebuilding the infrastructure. It is responsible for establishing businesses, for all this is necessary in order to give the refugees decent homes and the chance to live in Kosovo again.</p>
<p class="contents">In Kosovo, it is a question not only of a post-war situation which, from the point of view of damage, is not as bad as we had assumed at the beginning. We also know that the Albanians are in a position to do a very great deal themselves. They are not waiting for the mortar to be supplied to them by others. They are taking the matter in hand themselves. They are also content when they have already rebuilt parts of their houses and can then go on little by little to rebuild more. </p>
<p class="contents">No, this Agency also has a quite different task. It must in fact also fill the vacuum that has arisen in the last nine years. There are no authorities there. There is no administrative structure. This is why it is also so incredibly difficult to make any progress at all with the reconstruction and with getting companies established there. Forms of ownership have not been clarified. They cannot tell a firm in Western Europe that they can go and establish themselves there and take over an existing firm. That is just not on at all because no one knows to whom such firms belong. To a large extent, they are in fact state property. The question of who owns the land has not been clarified either. All these matters are the basis for primary tasks to be carried out by the new Agency on-site, and it is only on-site that they can be carried out. </p>
<p class="contents">We need people down there to fulfil really important tasks. We need engineers. We also need mine-clearance personnel. We need all types of know-how. That is what this Agency is designed for. </p>
<p class="contents">In this case, we have already achieved some things, or else others have conceded things to us – perhaps in anticipation of obedience to Parliament. For example, the director of the Agency must present a quarterly report on its activities to Parliament; the European Parliament must follow the discharge procedure and certify to the director that the budget plan has been implemented correctly; and the Commission must present to Parliament an annual report approved by the Agency’s administrative board.</p>
<p class="contents">We also demand that Parliament also, of course, be consulted if the work of this Agency is to be extended into other, similar areas. That cannot happen following a decision by the Council alone. We do not accept any more <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>, where we have not been consulted. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This report was forwarded to us in July. I have spent my holiday attending to, and then presenting, this report. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council has already issued a joint statement of its position which, it told me yesterday, it could no longer change. That of course is just not on. If today we were to take a final vote on this report, then, when it came down to it, we would have a situation in which the Council would be saying “Yes, you have worked well and what you have written is good, but we are not interested.” That is not going to happen today. We shall ask the Commission to take our side in accordance with the five points which were agreed yesterday, and in the weeks to come we shall ensure that the Council accepts most of what we said here, preferably everything, because we have in fact been working really quite efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I come now to a point which particularly exasperates me. The Reconstruction Agency – the umbrella organisation – is in Thessaloniki. The Stability Pact has its headquarters in Brussels. Can someone explain to me how stability in the western Balkans is to be organised from Brussels? I personally could not, and I am certain that the gentleman whose task this is is much less well placed to explain. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge you to help me convince the Council that the Reconstruction Agency for South-East Europe with its headquarters in Thessaloniki must be very closely connected with the headquarters of the Stability Pact, which must also be in Thessaloniki. I should like to add something on this matter. This Stability Pact intends to organise round-table conferences and is in fact already doing so. Do you know what round-table conferences are? Everyone in South-East Europe is sick to death of these. In the end, nothing of practical value comes out of them. If the Stability Pact were to organise a “working” table conference for democratisation and human rights, all well and good. Except that the Royaumont Initiative is already involved in precisely this field. Or if it were to organise a round-table conference on the subject of economic reconstruction, development and co-operation, again all well and good. But SECI is already doing that. Or it could do something on security issues. However, the South-Eastern European Defence Ministers’ Group is already doing this. So, there are at least four different organisations and groups down there with round tables and square tables, and all to no avail. In the end, nothing emerges from it all.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore asking the Council to combine the hea4dquarters of the Stability Pact and that of the Reconstruction Agency, to dovetail the two and finally to incorporate effectively the initiatives I have mentioned (I do not want to list them again now; you can read them in the minutes.) We do not need to re-invent the wheel when people have already been working on these matters for years. I would therefore ask you to support me in order to guarantee in practice the efficiency of this Agency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   Neil, <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, with your permission, indeed at the suggestion of the House, I would like to make a Commission statement on Kosovo. Naturally I value the work and the words of Mrs Pack and particularly the force and clarity with which she put a very convincing argument. I will respond properly to her report at the end of this morning’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that international civil and military administrations have been established and have begun the very difficult task of rebuilding in Kosovo. It calls on all parties to respect Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military agreements and undertakings in full and hopes that complete KFOR and UNMIK deployment will be completed without great delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the creation of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and deeply regrets the continuing ethnic violence. It condemns, in the strongest terms, violence perpetrated by any ethnic group and calls for maximum efforts to secure the reconciliation and cooperation which are essential to stability and security for all in the region. The Commission’s roles in the massive efforts to restore infrastructure and civil society in Kosovo will be of interest to the House. Broadly, there are two such roles: engagement in the major reconstruction programme and collaboration in the framework of UNMIK coordinating initiatives with other international donors. Clearly the first element will be discussed, particularly as this House debates the report by Mrs Pack, and I therefore highlight just a few of the relevant elements at this juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a total budget of EUR 137 million is foreseen for 1999 under the Obnova Programme of which EUR 46 million has been committed and implementation is under way. However, the Commission counts on the active support of this Parliament, which I am sure will be forthcoming, in obtaining both the remaining EUR 92 million for 1999 and the additional funding which will be required in the coming years. At present we estimate that some EUR 500 million will be needed in 2000 and EUR 500-700 million needed in 2001 and 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, efficient implementation will obviously be of crucial importance. The Commission proposes, therefore, the creation of a locally established reconstruction agency to ensure the effective application of the Community’s reconstruction programme in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the creation of the agency must clearly be well prepared and a taskforce has therefore been set up for that explicit purpose. The taskforce has programmed and is implementing the first EUR 46 million tranche of reconstruction assistance. Landmine clearance, customs and the procurement of essential supplies for rehabilitation of housing, public buildings and, in particular, Mitrovica Hospital are the main focus of attention. Later tranches will concentrate on preparing roads for winter conditions, municipal twinning in which assistance from Member States is being requested, and subsequently public utilities, public buildings, economic reconstruction and institution-building.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element of the Commission’s involvement goes beyond the implementation of Community assistance and extends to the wider international effort in Kosovo. It naturally includes a variety of activities. I refer to some of them for purposes of illustration. Firstly with the other participants in reconstruction and the major international financial institutions, the Commission is involved in damage and needs assessment. Indeed the Commission is conducting the only province-wide methodological assessment of physical damage. The initial results of that exercise relating to damage in housing and local infrastructure were issued at the conference arranged by the Commission and World Bank donors last July. A more comprehensive report, focusing on large-scale infrastructure, will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission shares responsibility for donor mobilisation with the World Bank and at that July conference of donors over EUR 2 billion was pledged. A second conference is scheduled for next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as the House is aware, the European Union has a special responsibility for reconstruction within the United Nations Civil Administration, UNMIK. These activities are organised in the so-called Pillar 4 which is headed by a Commission official, Mr Dixon. Thanks to the strenuous efforts made by Mr Dixon and his colleagues, Pillar 4 is working well, though faced with enormous problems due to the legal and institutional vacuum in Kosovo. The current priorities are putting the banking system in order, working closely with other pillars and KFOR to provide essential supplies, shelter and transport in advance of winter, preparing with the World Bank and the IMF a simplified budget and working on fiscal issues and drawing up with the World Bank a medium-term investment framework to be presented to the next pledging conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the European Union, and obviously the Commission, will also contribute to work in the other pillars: pillar 1 with UNHCR on humanitarian issues, pillar 2 with the UN and pillar 3 with OSCE on institution-building and democratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will strive to ensure full cooperation between the different participants where there are clear overlaps between civil administration and reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, following the Council’s recent decision on the easing of sanctions relating to the Kosovo crisis the Commission is putting forward a proposal for the exemption of Kosovo and Montenegro from particular EC sanctions against the former Republic of Yugoslavia. The oil embargo and the flight ban will therefore be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation from all relevant authorities in Kosovo will obviously be vital in order to establish effective controls on end use and to avoid circumvention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in recent years fellow Europeans have again been perpetrators and victims of appalling violence and attempts at ethnic extermination, sometimes described, in a euphemism which bewilders me, as “cleansing”. As ever, the worst results of such horrors are suffered by the innocent and the effects will blight their lives for many years to come. I know this House does not need convincing, but as a direct and leading contributor to relieving suffering and rebuilding normality and as a coordinator of the efforts of others, the European Union must make the maximum possible commitment. In those and other efforts, by working with people of all ethnic backgrounds we are for them and also working for the purposes and values that bind us together. In giving help as humanitarians, we hope that we are giving an example as Europeans too.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are three things whose presence we welcome. Firstly, we welcome the idea that this agency will be active at a grass roots level. It is at a grass roots level that problems will be solved, not in Brussels. It is better to do things in Pristina than to wait in vain for them to be done in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also welcome the maintenance, within the structure of the agency, of a system of hierarchical responsibility, which means that this agency will be headed by management staff from the Commission. Nevertheless, we do feel that the distribution of tasks is unsatisfactory and gives the staff sent by the Commission a too basic and limited role compared to workers recruited on-site.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also delighted with the administrative flexibility which I have just mentioned, which means that we will be able to attend to local needs with largely locally recruited staff who, consequently, know the area well. I shall describe this agency, Commissioner, as a kind of anti-TAO, as we have combined the flexibility necessary in TAOs with keeping hierarchy and responsibility, the lack of which has sometimes been criticised.</p>
<p class="contents">We have five main concerns. Firstly, the location. There is no point in leaving Brussels only to move to Thessaloniki. Either you are on-site or you are not. This agency will be dealing with problems in Kosovo, so it should be in Kosovo. Secondly, its length of stay. We support the idea of an agency which acts when needs arise. We oppose the idea of an agency whose administration would continue indefinitely. From this point of view, a length of stay of 30 months seems, at least to start with, quite satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fundamental concerns relate to the balance of power between the Commission, the Council and the Member States. This is of real concern to us. In the structure which has been proposed, we – and the Court of Auditors shares our concern – see a serious risk of the Commission’s administrative authority being dismembered in favour of an intergovernmental supervision which we cannot approve of. We are also in favour of a board of management which will not hand over the management of the agency to the Member States, but which will uphold the Commission’s control. We are defending you, Commissioner, and we are asking you to defend yourself too. We also favour not a management committee, but a consultative committee, in which the Member States will play a role, can make their voices heard, but in which they are not the real decision-makers.</p>
<p class="contents">Our last concern is for clear financial responsibility. It is essential that what is paid for by the European Union should be managed by the European Union, and that what is paid for by Member States should be managed by the Member States.</p>

The European Union generously released EUR 500 million to help the Kosovars rebuild their country and the Commission did its best too. Instead of the usual bureaucratic “to-ing and fro-ing” between Brussels and the location where the work takes place, the Commission opted for a decentralised agency which was in a position to start work on an autonomous basis. But nothing came of the Commission’s good intentions. Yet again they were torpedoed by political games in the Council. It was due to horsetrading, for it cannot be called otherwise, between the Germans and the Greeks, that the unhappy decision was taken to have the Reconstruction Agency based in Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads to wastage, wastage of money, wastage of manpower and wastage of efficiency. It also produces incomprehension in Kosovo, for at the end of the day, it is Kosovo itself that has to be reconstructed and not Greece. But the worst is still to come. Do you know that a Kosovar needs a visa to travel to Greece? And that he can only obtain that visa from the Greek Consulate in Belgrade? Of course that is very hostile territory for most Kosovars, which means that in deciding to base the agency in Thessaloniki, the ministers are excluding the people they are trying to help from the reconstruction process. The members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have decided unanimously, that is across all parties, to reject this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call for there to be effective supervision of the agency. Some of the points have already been mentioned by my colleague from the Committee on Budgets. Furthermore, we consider it to be of the greatest importance, of course, for OLAF to be able to intervene when things go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I will just return briefly to the question as to where the agency should be based, and I also speak for my group. Mrs Pack has very courageously taken upon herself the task of clearing up the Council’s mess, proposing a completely logical solution that involves establishing the agency in Pristina and linking it with the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki. That ought, at the same time, to give some substance to the motley collection of talking shops we have now.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud her intentions, but of course the question is whether the Council is going to take any notice. I think it was made clear yesterday that the Council has no intention of listening to what we want in any way, shape or form. That is why I wholeheartedly support her proposal to postpone things. We are simply going to have to do battle with the Council for what is right and efficient.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the reconstruction of Kosovo has not yet got underway and the Member States are already greedily asking themselves: what can my country get out of it? Duties are being distributed amongst the large countries, regardless as to whether they are major sponsors, and curtailing the Commission’s role is successfully preventing a rather broader vision from establishing itself. That is generally accomplished by setting up a Governing Council with representatives from the 15 Member States. In this way everyone can easily see if the interests of their own country are being given due attention. I am also under the impression that the 15 representatives of the Member States work on this Council on the basis of an oath of office which requires them to support and further the interests of their own country to the best of their ability. They do not work on the basis of a European oath of office, which could require them to promise to do maximum justice to European interests and visions, and not just to national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">If our attention was truly focused on Kosovo’s needs then we would never set up a Governing Council of this kind. For if this was truly the case then an advisory committee with a limited number of expert advisors, based on a European oath of office, would be sufficient. They would then be able to monitor how effective the implementation process was. Self-interest would not be the determining factor in their case, but rather the question as to whether the reconstruction of Kosovo might also give a nice boost to the business community in Kosovo and in the surrounding poor countries, whom we are only compensating in dribs and drabs for the loyal way in which they have carried out the boycott against Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we want to make a Stability Pact work for their sakes. By stability we don’t mean things being at a standstill, but, rather, progress. We can use the Council’s readiness to modify its proposals as regards the aforementioned board, to show the citizens what the Council’s true motives are and to what extent it has a horror of wastefulness. After all, it will tend to be cheaper to produce the goods needed for the reconstruction of Kosovo in the region rather than in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to another particular aspect. It is well known that building up the public administration will make a very important contribution to Kosovo’s developmental opportunities. In my country, the association of Dutch authorities is working very hard on this at local level. But they come up against KLA civil leaders wherever the KLA has been able to take over the office of civil leader. These civil leaders impose their will on the population, which directly frustrates all attempts to create a civil service that functions effectively and inspires confidence. That is why I ask myself if the Council would be prepared, at the suggestion of the Commission, to look into whether it might be better for such offices to be filled by experienced people from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">We know from our experiences in Bosnia that there are some civil leaders of decidedly criminal character and some real low-life in these posts, which impedes the proper development of local communities. Mr President, we can see whether this project will be feasible from the Council’s willingness to take up our request to amend their document, a process that will show that Kosovo really is at the centre of interest. I would therefore also like to see the Commission do what is necessary to urge the Council to make amendments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to warmly thank our colleague, Doris Pack, for her commitment and the firm stand she has adopted and also for her willingness to compromise on issues. We have therefore also fully supported her amendments. This Chamber proves in fact to be very united in its desire to repudiate the Council’s inability to be educated on these questions. Incidentally, we can hardly educate them in fact because they are not actually here. I hope that the Commission is on our side even if Commissioner Kinnock could not say so as clearly as I am doing. For we are not concerned here with who is right, we or the Council, but rather with together learning what mistakes have been made. The citizens of our Member States cannot accept there again being even the possibility of money being squandered. Just like our citizens, we are prepared to spend money, but it must be spent efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make four points. Firstly, we have agreed – and I am very happy about this – that the Agency is to be in Pristina, but – and here I differ somewhat from Mrs Van der Laan – that Thessaloniki is definitely the appropriate location for regional co-operation organised at a higher level and for the reconstruction of the region as whole. It is a question of all the peoples and all the countries in this region co-operating with each other, and that can certainly and unambiguously be better organised from Thessaloniki than from Brussels. This division of responsibilities is therefore certainly a division which we fully and completely support. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: for a single Agency, two management committees are planned, each with the 15 Member States represented. What is the sense in having two management committees for one Agency for the 15 Member States if not that they want to allocate as many tasks to themselves as possible? However, it is not a question of our in fact distributing tasks for the reconstruction in Europe but, rather, a question of the reconstruction being efficient, speedy and well organised, and I hope, Mrs Schreyer, that you will take special care to ensure that the relevant money is spent efficiently and that it does not again benefit the individual Member States and their firms and that you will also, of course, bear in mind the need for supervision by OLAF. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: Mrs Pack proposes that all the States in South-East Europe or, rather, the firms from these states can be involved. I must confess that we have had discussions in our group about whether firms from the countries which are not sufficiently willing, or not at all willing, to work alongside us can in fact be involved in the reconstruction. That is, in the first place, Croatia and, in the second place, a country which is still not at all prepared to participate, namely Yugoslavia. We want to look forward and to also give these countries the opportunity to be involved, along with their firms and companies, and we hope that these countries and their governments will also be prepared to take part in the reconstruction. With regard to Croatia, this is a laborious undertaking. We hope that, despite all the difficulties in Serbia or Yugoslavia, there will also be fundamental changes, and for this reason we shall agree to the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to return to what Commissioner Kinnock said. We have not become involved in Yugoslavia and, in particular, Kosovo in order to replace one ethnic group with another ethnic group. I certainly understand the displeasure, the rage and, indeed, the hatred felt by many Kosovan Albanians towards the Serbian population. We will not however tolerate and will not accept that another type of ethnic discrimination should occur with people being murdered and driven from their homes. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must make sure that there is co-operation between all ethnic groups in the region as a whole. That is the European goal which we must pursue with great efficiency. Therefore, my group will also agree to the amendment’s being deferred, because the Council must first do its work.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I was in Kosovo last winter and wrote a report to Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights. I visited a number of private aid organisations. Their biggest problem was the Commission’s centralist working methods and the unduly long time it therefore took to deal with matters. The Commission’s local representative had to ask about everything in Brussels because the people in Brussels were so dreadfully afraid of mistakes being made. I would say to the Commissioner, however, that this is not how you combat fraud and mistakes. If the work is to be made efficient, it should be delegated. People locally need to have powers to make the necessary arrangements to act quickly and efficiently. If fraud and irregularities are there, the hammer should fall heavily upon those responsible locally. It is therefore quite naturally unacceptable, Mr President, if the chain of command is now to be still longer, that is to say if the agency in Kosovo has to wait not only for orders from Brussels but also from Thessaloniki. This must not happen. The Liberal Group is shocked by the horse trading which apparently went on when Mr Hombach was appointed and the office located in Thessaloniki. We hope this doesn’t cause too much damage. We do not want the people who are having a hard enough time as it is managing the construction work in Pristina also having to struggle with additional bureaucracy in Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would urge that, as far as possible, local, civil representatives of the Albanian population are relied upon, that the Albanians’ own talents are used and that they are not helped with things they can work out for themselves. The most important means of opposing KLA gangs, which are to be stopped and fought against whenever they drive away Serbs, is to mobilise the civil leaders in Kosovo. There are in fact parties which have won 80% of the votes cast in elections. They are there all the time. Their leaders are there all the time. They are ready to take over. And locally, too, there are leaders who can take over. They are the best means of opposing the KLA, which I have only very, very little sympathy for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree that the Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo should be established in Pristina, but the Agency or the Office for the Reconstruction of Bosnia was in Sarajevo, and still faced enormous problems. In naming Pristina, we are not really saying anything other than that an agency for reconstruction in Kosovo should logically and effectively be done with the inhabitants of Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">I propose nevertheless that we also discuss the way in which reconstruction will actually take place. Now, as far as this is concerned, what we know of the European Union in Bosnia is the enormous bureaucratic weight of the way we function as the European Union. In other words, instead of just focussing on Thessaloniki or Pristina, we should learn lessons from the situation in Bosnia, and try to set up autonomous structures which will be able to decide – in Pristina – on the details of the heavy reconstruction, that is: bridges, housing, streets, etc. and, at the same time, to work out the details of the reconstruction of the fabric of society. So what programme does this civilian society need in order to be able to, as Mr Haarder said, take control of reconstruction? Let us not leave this – I will not say to the KLA groups – I will simply say to the temptation to take military action which we should perhaps condemn in political terms, but which we can understand after everything that the people have been through, out of fear that a similar situation might reoccur. It is true that only democratisation will take us forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We could cite the example from Bosnia of the “3000 roofs for Bosnia” programme. This was a very basic programme, which consisted of saying to the population, “If you rebuild the walls of your house, we will pay for the roof, and if you have already rebuilt your roof, we will pay for your heating.” This was a programme designed to get the population active, at all levels. I would therefore like to see us think carefully about autonomous decision-making bodies in Pristina, which would give the population the power to decide, in conjunction with us, what needs to be done. I would also not want to see an excess of bureaucracy in Brussels, given the way the European Union functions as a rule.</p>

<p class="contents">The responsibilities of the European Union and the so-called ‘International Community’ are huge. Already, amendment 2 of Mrs Pack’s report which is under debate today, stipulates EU co-operation with those Albanian Kosovars who are interested in the reconstruction of their state, and that we must help them to participate and contribute to the European Union’s projects. But what are these projects? </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the report admits quite openly that it is seeking the creation of a state in Kosovo. Secondly, flagrant blackmail is being carried out via the criminal bombings of NATO on the devastated people of Yugoslavia who are being called upon not only to submit ethnically, socially and politically, but also to adopt a style of leadership acceptable to the Americans and NATO in order to have any hope of reconstruction for this devastated country. This policy is catastrophic. It continues its endeavours to dissolve Yugoslavia through other means. It supports the criminal activities of the KLA and seriously jeopardises the stability of its neighbouring countries and of all the Balkan region. </p>
<p class="contents">The unrestrained action by the KLA, under the wings of NATO will, sooner or later, create great problems even in Albania and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia. This is a clear indication of the type of peace which you would like to impose on the Balkans. In all honesty, does anybody really believe that the KLA will have disarmed by the 19th of the month? </p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly understandable that today we are debating the economic reconstruction of Kosovo, which, however, is directly related not only to expediency policies of the Member States, but also to their efforts to distribute those funds set aside for the rebuilding of Kosovo to the various associations within the Member States.

Indeed, its attitude does not seem to take into consideration the spirit and approach taken by Parliament both in the first amendment of the 1998 Directive and in its Resolution of July this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the objections regarding the choice of where to base the Agency in question – Pristina in our opinion and not Thessaloniki – as well as the objections regarding the unilateral possibility, or so it seems – in the Council’s opinion – of extending the activities of the Agency itself to other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without even consulting Parliament beforehand. And this, at a time when the quarterly inspection and auditing of the Agency’s activities fall to Parliament, albeit after the event<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, regarding the composition of the Agency’s board, I do not understand the reasons that should lead Parliament to envisage the nomination of the seven independent experts by the Commission only. This is in direct contrast to the proposals put forward by the Commission itself which, in conjunction with the committee responsible, has instead envisaged the presence of a representative of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not appropriate, in my view, for Parliament to exclude, paradoxically, the Member States that constitute the European Union from a context of decision-making. First and foremost, this context is political and its operational nature comes second. This means that it is not a question of pursuing preventative checks as regards the overall aid proposed, even if the amount, EUR 1,900 million over the next five years, would suggest that this is appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a committed politician she enjoys great recognition among Balkans experts, for Mrs Pack was and still is “in situ”.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be brief on the setting up of a European Office for Reconstruction. A commendable initiative. We support the two main strategies advocated by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">After a dark, repressive decade, there is light at the end of the tunnel again for society in Kosovo. The sticking point continues to be whether this applies equally well at this stage to those of the Serbian minority who have stayed behind, as it does to the Albanian majority that has now returned. In any case, EU aid should be for the benefit of both population groups, albeit on a proportional basis. A much-needed incentive to show mutual tolerance, provided from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a general comment on the practicalities of delivering aid to the sorely afflicted Kosovars. Either it can be distributed evenly across the legendary Field of Blackbirds (Kosovo Polje), or it can be put to use through model projects. The latter approach is favoured by the sad fact that some regions and towns in the de jure Serbian province had to pay a particularly high price in human and material terms, owing to the fury of Milosevic’s special police units and the regular Yugoslav army. Selecting a number of model projects and developing them successfully is precisely what is needed to provide the Kosovars with something concrete to hold on to, for it is progress that is likely to help them gain in courage.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the restoration of public order in Kosovo is of course an essential prerequisite to the success of all reconstruction assistance, by which I mean EU assistance too of course. There is plenty of provocation from both sides. On no account should the international community tolerate this, rather it should take a co-ordinated and resolute stand against this on the spot, and under the leadership of KFOR, the organisation that has primary responsibility for public safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We have frequently heard about the faith the West has in the Kosovan parallel social institutions, i.e. the Albanian shadow state of the last ten years, being an ideal starting point for a new beginning for this territorial bone of contention, yet this idea merits critical comment. Whilst there are undoubtedly areas of society which would lend themselves to this (think of the underground education system or continued medical care and specialisation), it will not do to simply follow the same line where politics is concerned. That is why elections ought not to be a priority for the moment. Political calm, allowing the political landscape in Kosovo to take shape, are musts.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end on a lighter note. A positive development is the return of a critical Kosovan press, which covers a broad political spectrum. It doesn’t hesitate to denounce the misdeeds committed by its own Albanian people in open and severe terms. Take the expulsion of the Roma and the Serbians. This indigenous display of moral courage certainly justifies having a European Office for Reconstruction in Pristina.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the latest reports from the UN, Kosovo is today a completely devastated country in which neither people’s security is guaranteed nor the population’s nutritional needs provided for. However, the European Union’s responsibility must this time involve more than merely financing the reconstruction. The reinstatement of a democratically just system is a prerequisite for any reconstruction programme, and the EU bears political, just as much as social and economic, responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As the negative examples from Russia have shown in recent weeks, billions of dollars in aid often reach only a fraction of the people who are really affected by a crisis. The flow of cash must therefore be transparent. We must all be given a guarantee that Europeans’ tax payments do not trickle away into the accounts of so many political and economic criminals. The European Union is alone responsible for ensuring that this money is not misused. As Members of Parliament, we have a responsibility towards our electors who are financing this reconstruction with their tax money. We depend upon a positive opinion in the population and it is therefore a basic responsibility of the European Union to be able also to explain to those who are helping to finance the reconstruction how the money is being used.</p>
<p class="contents">For this, the European Union this time needs a modern, efficient, rationally managed and also transparent form of conflict management. Only under these conditions can we count upon broad support for this project from the European population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that this is also an opportunity not just to turn our attention to the main issue, that is, that this Agency can operate by drawing on the principles of transparency and efficiency that are crucial given the current situation in the Balkans. But I also think it is important and must be stressed that we must now tackle the reconstruction of the social, economic and moral fabric in a context where a broader vision of South-East Europe surely cannot be a dividing factor with regard to locating the Agency’s headquarters in one place instead of another.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard my colleagues’ interventions, I think that we are asking a fair and legitimate question: ‘What is the Member State’s interest, which certainly cannot be a priority interest?’ So we need to ask another question as well – in the context of the European Union, what damage occurred to neighbouring countries owing to the action and events in Kosovo? Entire regional economies in various Member States have collapsed over recent months through the closure of airports and the events connected to the war in Kosovo. I refer in particular to the areas in Southern Italy. </p>
<p class="contents">So I think it is important to make more of an overall assessment, especially in light of an intervention policy which, as I read in the report on next year’s Union budget, provides for a far-ranging reorganisation of the policies concerning small and medium-sized businesses located in border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the real problem is trying to create conditions which make it possible to include, in a Mediterranean context, a more complete assessment, and one which gives, above all, a broad perspective. It does not mean espousing one solution instead of another solution in a parochial way as regards the location of the Agency’s headquarters, but we must keep in mind the clear and well-defined basic options.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the speed, efficiency and transparency of the activities of this Agency, it is important to try to look at its establishment as a good opportunity for reconstruction, quickly and as a priority, in the current situation in Kosovo. But we also need to create the conditions whereby migration in the Mediterranean will be examined in careful detail. </p>
<p class="contents">Thousands of refugees are now reaching our shores with no destination in mind, while the Member States and the European Union are completely incapable of providing a perspective and a specific response to this problem. I think that this is the main issue we need to focus on, in order to avoid the possibility of having to assess other situations similar to Kosovo in the near future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has a major role to play where this reconstruction is concerned, and we believe that is as it should be. However, we do not want the same mistakes to be made as were made in the past with large programmes such as those in Bosnia and in other places. That is why we want there to be more supervision, and this Parliament has a role to play here too. OLAF must be able to carry out its checks, and that will help us to implement the programme rapidly and effectively, for we are already receiving reports of delays that have occurred in the delivery of the things which are needed to quickly build Kosovo up.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, and this is also in Mrs Pack’s report, the direct involvement of the EU Member States will have to be kept to a minimum. Hence our proposal that we should not set up another of the famous management committees but, rather, that we should work together with an advisory committee. I consider that to be one of this Parliament’s important demands. We have often found in the past that things went wrong because the Member States interfered too much with programmes or wanted to carry out too many parts of the programmes themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of a programme must, as far as possible, be managed on-site, in this case from Pristina. That is the operational centre. It is the people there that must do the real work, and I mean particularly the Kosovars themselves. For another lesson we can learn from Bosnia is that too much is done by the international community and too little by the people themselves, which leads me to think sometimes that those countries are being run from outside rather from within. At the end of the day, they are, after all, going to have to do it themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo comes under the Stability Pact, which has to do with the proposal to establish the headquarters of the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki. I am completely in agreement with Mrs Pack’s proposal as far as that is concerned. It makes sense to administer that from within the region too. One of the amendments states that the countries of Southern and Eastern Europe should also have the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction projects. That too is a good thing. I think there is a great deal of expertise and experience available in the region which we can make use of. However, my group would make one qualification at this point. We assume that when we talk of South European countries and their involvement in the projects for reconstruction, we are not talking about the governments and authorities of Serbia and Croatia. We believe it is still too early to make overtures to these two countries. We are aware of the situation in Serbia, the problems surrounding Tudjman, the refugee situation in Krajina and the relationship between Tudjman and the government of Croatia and the Hague Tribunal. That is why we have certain reservations where the direct involvement of these countries’ authorities is concerned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Other speakers also stated the same. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, today we have heard many minced words and unclear allusions. The Commissioner told us that they are witnessing problems in Kosovo of an ‘institutional and legal vacuum’, as he stated. How did that vacuum come about? What are the Union’s administration and the rest doing? What is this vacuum? And how do you intend to fill it? You told us that you will carry out an assessment of the damage. Just in Kosovo? Not in the surrounding areas? Just for the physical damage and not, for example, for the environmental damage? In other words, you are saying that you wish to reconstruct Kosovo in an institutional, legal, geographic, geo-political and political vacuum. I admire you! </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, you and other speakers are saying all this, yet, at the same time, you are condemning the ethnic persecutions and trying to reconstruct democracy. You know very well that none of that is possible. The KLA will not prevent you from doing your work with their tanks but by their very presence and the tolerance that you are showing towards them, they will be an obstruction. What is more, the KLA is not the biggest danger. We have a great deal of past experience, Commissioner. I can, of course, recall Greece being in ruins in the wake of the Nazi occupation and the civil war, which was won with the aid of certain countries, and of course, more recently, Bosnia, Russia and Albania. Your greatest dangers are profiteering, land-grabbing, the secondary economy, the black market, and the mafia who are in practice trying to build a Kosovo with structures and interests as they themselves see fit. And yet, you have not batted an eyelid. I heard no mention of those issues throughout the whole debate.</p>
<p class="contents">All this talk about Pristina and Thessaloniki is completely futile when we have this great problem facing us. Needless to say, it would be better for those who take the decisions and those who impose them to keep at arm’s length from each other. With this in mind, therefore, I must express my pessimism and I expect, of course, some more encouraging comments and answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must recognise the fact that this is simply one of the results of the monstrous aggression committed by the government of the United States of America and its European henchmen in contravention of every rule in international law and also of every political teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of my colleagues have made it quite clear today that whilst ostensibly fighting against ethnic cleansing, what we are actually seeing, of course, is the complete elimination of Serbs from Kosovo. That is the reality. The civil infrastructures have been systematically destroyed, not just in Kosovo, but in Serbia too, in most instances, with no military justification whatsoever. Bridges, roads, waterways, railways, electricity stations, government buildings and even hospitals have been destroyed, not to mention the dead, coyly referred to as collateral damage, or their families. All this was done with no more justification than if NATO had bombed the bridges over the Loire to prevent the French police or Gendarmerie from intervening in a suburb of Strasbourg, a sight that we might experience sooner than you may think.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of Europe paid for destruction to take place. Now they will be paying for reconstruction. We look forward to hearing what the United States’ contribution will be. In the current state of affairs, we approve of limiting invitations to tender and the awarding of contracts to anyone connected in any way with a Member State or Beneficiary State. The question of where the Agency should be located is important, but less so than the definition of eligible countries. The United States of America and the countries of Europe are unfortunately responsible not only for the destruction in Kosovo, but also for the destruction in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">But it understood, these few thoughts do not represent the slightest approval for a criminal policy which will go down in history as a terrible precedent which may well cause us to suffer as a consequence in the not too distant future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I am also saying, and this is a request to the Commission, that the piecemeal approach adopted in relation to the supplementary and amending budgets must come to an end, for it has little to do with creative budget policy but is instead reminiscent of creative accounting.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be as well, Mrs Schreyer – in view too of the foreseeable problems with the supplementary budgets for the year 2000 – to find an adequate solution to this issue by December’s Second Reading of the Budget for the year 2000. The Council is not even in fact represented from an administrative point of view, and if it has already reached a common position without waiting to hear of Parliament’s position, then it is also a matter here of putting the question of a new culture of responsibility and of better co-operation very much higher up on the agenda for public discussion in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But we have some time. The Council will not formally be taking a close look at this matter and making a final decision until 11 October. Mrs Pack has made it very clear that the amendment to the regulation contains extremely positive signs, namely in connection with the questions of decentralisation, the opening up of invitations to tender, and much more besides. But if the compromise over the location of the Reconstruction Agency ends up looking like Mrs Pack has presented it – on the one hand Pristina, on the other hand the integrated arrangement of Thessaloniki – then it is that much more important that basic questions should be clarified; that the entire undertaking should take place under the responsibility of the Commission; that the Agency should not be structured in such a way that, even more than already existing agencies, it straddles individual nation states; that OLAF can ascertain that the job plan is being set out separately; that the budgetary powers of the European Parliament are safeguarded; and that, if the work concerned is extended, the European Parliament will continue to be involved. Therefore, it would be good, Mrs Schreyer and Mr Kinnock, if, in the spirit of new co-operation under the five-point programme, the Commission could make a new proposal on the basis of our amendment. In this way, we can achieve a satisfactory solution in terms of the regulation, and this dispute will not be introduced into the normal budget procedures. I do not want to introduce it into these but will on principle reserve for myself the option to do so if the Council does not move on the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Balkans ought to be top on the agenda of foreign policy within the Union because a stabilised, developed and democratic Balkan region is an essential link for us to be able to have a positive impact on the creation of a more stabilised and democratic Russia. A stable, democratic and developed Balkan region is a prerequisite for the Union to have an effective and positive policy in the troubled Caucasian region and oil-producing countries which are threatening the peace and stability within that region. A stable, democratic and developed Balkan region makes it easier for the Union to have a positive influence in the Middle East and in Eastern Mediterranean countries. </p>
<p class="contents">However, a stable Balkan region would mean that we too ought to have a stable and long-term strategy for peace, democracy and development, because there must not be any doubt in our minds that up until now the Union has not been a key player in the Balkans. To put it more succinctly, we provide the money and bear the cost and the Americans formulate the policy and collect the profit. An integrated policy is required therefore; a common development, peace, stability and co-operation strategy for the area, such as is beginning to be outlined by both the Stability Pact and by the Reconstruction Agency, which will be effective once it gets underway, with its seat in Thessaloniki. It is only a start, but a good start all the same. We must exercise a policy which, for it to be productive, must not involve sanctions or predispositions towards the people in the area, but which must promote democratisation and development as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this was what our colleague Yannos Kranidiotis was striving for and we Greeks would like to honour him with our work here today by continuing his endeavours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union, which, without a doubt, plays a pivotal role in dealing with the problems, rightly decided to widen the scope of the regulation, particularly as regards the Reconstruction Agency in the area. Mr President, this is what led to certain misunderstandings. It concerns the reconstruction of the region and not of Kosovo. For that reason, I am ashamed of the stance taken by the Commission so far. I do not believe that anyone imagines that plans for the reconstruction of the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia or of Yugoslavia can be drawn up in Pristina. We must look at the long-term problems and deal with those. This service, which must be set up together with the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki, since as I said it concerns the reconstruction of the whole of the region, must be authoritative. There must be management autonomy in Pristina but this service must be powerful enough so as to be able to overcome any obstacles. After all, we are not only concerned with repairing the damage. We are not just concerned with restoring the necessary institutions nor are we concerned solely with law and order, but we must give the people hope that we will make a substantial contribution to the economic and social life of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right. We must be more careful. The experience to date in Bosnia-Herzegovina shows that reconstruction efforts were costly and not particularly effective. Therefore, this service must now be able to set in motion the reconstruction programme in Kosovo, to bring back the refugees and to also function on the basis of the humanitarian measures adopted so far. The financial assistance made available thus far is obviously not enough and should be more, but I believe Parliament will agree that more should be given if this service proves to be more effective. It is a very positive sign, Mr President, that for the first time Parliament has become involved in this affair. It has jurisdiction and, mainly through intergovernmental delegation, can monitor the functioning of this service which, in turn, should naturally organise the actual implementation of the supplementary measures to reinstate the refugees. It must revive the economy at a local level and it must create free communication between countries and between the regions of the area. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not just about repairing the damage caused by the war. It is not just about the rebuilding and restoration of telecommunications. It is about our fully re-establishing life in the region and being able to see more clearly what is also happening in Yugoslavia. If Yugoslavia were left at the mercy of the current regime, then any hopes of repairing the psychological damage caused by the conflict would be dashed. Perhaps now is not the time to analyse why this conflict arose and who made the most mistakes. What is certain is that we do not have the right to make any more mistakes. The European Union has a role which it must play effectively and which it must take seriously.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is not appropriate to make pompous speeches, and Europe’s response to the Kosovo crisis in setting up the Reconstruction Agency in Kosovo is a genuine, operative response. I would define the Agency, as it appears, by using four adjectives: agile, efficient, transparent and independent. It will not have an infinite life span and will have to involve the local communities. It must ensure the public receives as much information as possible, including via regular postings on the internet.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the headquarters, I agree with the wise meeting point proposed by Mr Swoboda. I liked the image of the ray of hope suggested by Mrs Van der Laan, but I would be more realistic. There is a considerable glimmer of hope, yes, but the political problem has not yet been resolved. How can we really explain our role in the various places in crisis, not only Kosovo, without reviewing the Financial Perspective? By hunting for funds in a disorganised and unsystematic way? It might be appropriate, in the right place, to consider this point. In particular, I think that the Mediterranean deserves adequate financial help. The Mediterranean is where the future of a new era founded on harmony, peace and international co-operation is in the balance.</p>

Our problem is that our good decisions get watered down on the way, and the coffers begin to leak. This principle of feeding off the burden has to end. For that reason, I would like to make three points. Firstly, we do not need two administrative bodies for one agency; secondly, decision-making must be carried out where the work is being done, that is to say at the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency in Kosovo; and thirdly, it is important to work in co-operation with the local people and, more particularly, on a multi-ethnic basis, as has been emphasised here. Actually, I could put it this way: reconstruction is not a matter of bricks and mortar, but co-operation. It is thus a new time for both the Commission and ourselves. Three criteria, directness, an unambiguous approach and transparency, give us strength, and will enable us to succeed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to touch upon two questions which do not directly concern reconstruction but which are of special importance for the future not only of Kosovo but also of the entire region. About 15 days ago, the UN’s special envoy, Mr Kouchner, introduced a new currency to Kosovo. I do understand the need for a stable currency, partly for the benefit of the work being done there. What I do not understand, however, is the penalisation of the dinar, the official currency of the state to which Kosovo still belongs. The second resolution contradicts the convictions of us all and also the agreement made between the UN, NATO and the KLA. The KLA is not being disarmed, at least not completely. Instead, there are still KLA units, only they now put on different uniforms and will still be armed. Have we, as the European Union, an opinion on these resolutions, Mr Vice-President of the Commission and, if so, what is it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a maiden vice-presidential speaker, I am in that position again in my life.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to what has been a very high-quality debate, I am extremely pleased to be joined by my new colleague, the Budget Commissioner, Michaele Schreyer, whose presence is evidence of close interest in this issue and its financial and budgetary implications. It is extremely useful that Mrs Schreyer has been here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank very much the rapporteurs and members of the various committees who have given such thorough and urgent attention to the crucial issue that is before the House now. I would also like to thank them for the quality of their contributions and the commitment they have shown in offering their opinions and submitting the report by Mrs Pack.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, the Commission proposal essentially concerns the setting-up of an agency to implement the Community’s reconstruction programmes, initially in Kosovo but later, when circumstances allow, in other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia like Serbia and Montenegro. Clearly the agency’s mandate does not cover assistance in the other countries of former Yugoslavia or other Balkan countries because this structure is the specific European Union instrument for the reconstruction of Kosovo. It is designed to maintain the European Union’s necessary control over the reconstruction programme and to safeguard its independence and right of initiative in the process. The agency’s work must be clearly associated with the European Union and not diluted in the broader activities of the numerous bodies that are dealing with Kosovo and the region. That is not for any reason of insularity; a clear division of tasks is essential in order to ensure proper accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal reflects the need to set up an instrument for the rapid, decentralised and efficient management of reconstruction aid in a way that takes account of the urgency of the situation and the exceptional efforts that are required. Honourable Members repeatedly have drawn attention to those realities in this debate and indeed on many other occasions. The Commission’s initiative takes past experience into account and, in particular, the difficulties encountered in the first phase of reconstruction in Bosnia which, as the House has rightly recalled again this morning, led to delays in implementing those programmes. The Commission’s proposal to set up a European Agency for reconstruction is largely based on Parliament’s recommendations on reconstruction in Bosnia - recommendations which rightly underline the need to decentralise the management of aid by increasing local staff numbers and to provide for mechanisms that are better adapted to the urgency of the reconstruction requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make particular reference to certain aspects of the Commission proposal relating to the agency’s structure. Following the request to set up an agency made by the Cologne European Council, the Commission’s proposal is largely based on the model of all other existing European agencies: a structure with its own legal personality and decision-making powers and with the Member States represented on a governing board. Such a structure will enable reconstruction to be managed by means of specially adapted procedures which are unlike those used in the Commission’s departments. It will enable staff to be recruited specifically for the requirements of reconstruction and for a period of time, as Mr Bourlanges sought, that is limited to the tasks in hand. The agency will employ staff in ways that are subject to statutory provisions for carrying out public service tasks which the technical assistance office should not and cannot take on.</p>
<p class="contents">As is the case with all other existing Community agencies, the Commission proposes that Member States be represented on the governing board so that their presence ensures full coordination of the European Union’s activities with those carried out in the field by Member States. It could encourage Member States to use the agency to implement their own programmes. Furthermore, the participation of Member States in the governing board will make it possible to ensure that once the annual programme is decided by the Commission, all the rest of the decisions related to projects will be taken on the ground without referring back to the management committee composed of Member States in Brussels. Regardless of the proposed competences of the agency, I would like to make it quite clear that the Commission will continue to exercise its powers and fully assume its responsibilities. The agency will not be empowered to determine policy guidelines or to approve the reconstruction programmes. It is the Commission that will take, and will be accountable for, the decisions on the programmes to be carried out by the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the location of the agency’s headquarters, as this morning’s discussions again made evident, has led to some controversy in the Council as well as in this House. The function of the agency is to ensure efficiency and speed in the management of aid. That involves decentralising management and establishing effective cooperation with other operators from the international community in Kosovo. Pristina has, therefore, been chosen by the Commission as the location for the agency’s headquarters. That is where the provisional administration of Kosovo is based and all the agencies and organisations responsible for reconstruction in the region are located. It is Kosovo that is to be reconstructed.</p>
<p class="contents">Logically, therefore, the agency should have its operational base there, although in arguing for that option, everyone will, I am sure, bear in mind the very persuasive points that Mr Cohn-Bendit made in today's debate about previous experience.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House is aware, the Member States agreed to set up the agency’s headquarters and general services in Thessaloniki. The Commission has entered a reservation against this decision. As far as the Commission is concerned, the establishment of the agency in Pristina is not a mere detail of its proposal. It is a basic requirement for the efficient management for the programmes and the achievement of the agency’s objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Disputation which causes delay is obviously not acceptable in view of the need to find a rapid solution to the problem and the Commission is therefore open to a compromise which maintains those objectives of speed and effectiveness. The Commission has already sent a document to the Council presidency and to Parliament in which it proposes a clear functional division of the agency services and staff between Pristina and Thessaloniki, with all the operational services concentrated in Pristina and the agency’s director based there at its centre of operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank Parliament on behalf of the Commission for its amendments. The new Commission will obviously study them closely. I emphasise, however, that the Commission and Parliament have the same objective: to maximise the speed and efficiency of the Commission’s efforts on the ground in Kosovo for the people of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">As a new Commission, we would like to take a short time to look at the situation and your amendments, in order to be as sure as we can be that we get things right. I am certain that the Council will wish to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to involve the people of Kosovo in the reconstruction process and to ensure effective coordination with non-governmental organisations. Budgetary transparency is clearly necessary, as Parliament proposes to draw a clear distinction between the contribution from the Community budget and contributions from other sources and to distinguish between expenditure on physical reconstruction and on institution-building.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Commission would be in favour of Parliament being consulted before any decision by the Council on extending the agency’s activities to other regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That would enhance the role of Parliament, which already receives a quarterly report on the agency’s activities and has the important task of giving discharge to the agency’s director for the implementation of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that full advantage will be taken of the slight pause that it is generally agreed is needed if we are to achieve our objective of a speedy and efficient aid effort for the benefit of and with the assistance of the people of Kosovo.</p>

But still I have the feeling that there is something wrong with the way in which this Parliament organises its business. What are we achieving? The Commission has submitted a proposal concerning the establishment of the Agency headquarters in Pristina. The Parliament supports the Commission and there is a conflict with the Council. What do we see? The Council’s benches are empty. So there is no response from the Council. The Council appears not to have been invited to come here and tell us what it is going to do. I would therefore like to ask you the following question: could you please convey my wish to the Conference of Presidents that in future, when debates take place on subjects where there is conflict with the Council, the debate is organised in such a way that the Council attends so that we can enter into direct confrontation.
