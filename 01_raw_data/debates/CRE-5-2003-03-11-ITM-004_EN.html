As a consensus could not be reached on the person to draft it, it decided that the Chairman of the committee should also be the rapporteur and I was left with the wonderful task of putting this report together. Because of that, I am wearing three hats at the same time – if that is possible. I wear one hat as the rapporteur and reflect the wishes of the committee in the way it has voted and amended the original draft. I wear another hat as the Chairman of the committee, thereby keeping an eye on the rapporteur. I wear my third hat as a British Labour Member who is at odds with a number of amendments from his own political family, the PSE. It has not been easy trying to put those three together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to say that the only change I attempted to make to this report was to try to merge Paragraphs 6 and 8 to make it more coherent. However, I failed to achieve a consensus amongst the political groups and, therefore, the report stands as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could change those hats – which I cannot because I am wearing my hat as the rapporteur – and if I were speaking as a British Labour Member, then I would approve Mrs Buitenweg's text as it reads well, it is simple, concise and, in particular, it does not make any big deal about own-resources! However, I would run a mile – well perhaps I could manage half a mile – from the amendments by the PSE Group! Let me make it absolutely clear that I am not speaking as a British Labour Member and, therefore, I cannot say those things. I have to wear my hat as the rapporteur and speak as the rapporteur, knowing full well that the Chairman is keeping a watchful eye on what I say.</p>
<p class="contents">In fairness, the report is acceptable to all the political groups. The vote was almost unanimous in committee, but there are one or two small points of disagreement on own-resources. That is why the PSE Group has tabled two amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are all agreed upon is that the budget procedure needs to be simplified. That is quite clear. The own-resources system in this age of transparency is completely opaque and no one outside the Committee on Budgets or the Budget Directorate-General understands what it is about and how it is made up. Codecision is needed and, therefore, compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure need to be eradicated. This is stated quite simply in the first three paragraphs of Mrs Buitenweg's report. We need to reform, update and simplify our procedures. There is a need for the budgetary system to be more transparent, comprehensive and democratic, and the codecision procedure should apply to all legislation, including the Financial Regulation and the budgetary procedure. Under those conditions, compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure would disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope when we vote on this – I am sure the vote will be successful – that we can send this along to the members of the Convention and that our Parliament representatives on the Convention can present this as Parliament's position for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That sentence should be printed at the head of the financial part of the constitutional treaty that will be our future constitution, for it is self-evident that this should incorporate a financial constitution in the form of a chapter devoted to finances. That is indeed provided for in the outline of the constitutional draft on which the Convention is working.</p>
<p class="contents">The chapter on finance should specify the most important budgetary principles and lay down the principal instruments, principles and, above all, rules whereby decisions are to be reached, as regards both outgoings and receipts. The financial constitution would thereby lay down Parliament's budgetary rights. The Convention must come to treat this as a core point. A parliament's budgetary rights are a yardstick indicating the degree to which a system is democratic, and it is the Commission's opinion that the time has now come for the European Parliament to be accorded full budgetary rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wynn, on the competence and extensive experience with which, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, he has even-handedly set out the core points in his report and put forward proposals for the future constitution. I also congratulate him on his ability, so to speak, to wear three hats at once!</p>
<p class="contents">In Budget matters, Parliament and the Commission cooperate so closely that it is not surprising that a very large number of Parliament's proposals are identical with those put forward by the Commission or tend in the same direction. Among these is the principle that the Budget's receipts and expenditure should balance and that expenditure should not be allowed to be funded from credit. Another is the proposal that the multiannual financial perspective should be incorporated into the constitution as an instrument; the consequence of this would be that, in future, the multiannual financial perspective would no longer be founded on an agreement, but would become a law enacted jointly by Parliament and the Council on the Commission's initiative. Even when it comes to the proposal that the European Development Fund should in future be an integrated part of the Community Budget, there is complete agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Community Budget's outgoings, let me also address an issue that has not yet been discussed in the Convention, but is on the agenda, and that is whether or not the future constitution – like the present Treaty – should exclude the possibility of military expenditure being borne by the Community Budget. Is there not much to be said for the idea that, where Petersberg tasks are undertaken jointly, the costs resulting from these joint operations should be borne by the Community Budget?</p>
<p class="contents">That the Community Budget should be funded from own resources is a firmly-embedded principle about which there is no debate, but does the present financial structure reflect the principles of transparency? Are our financial arrangements sufficiently autonomous; is it enough for Parliament to be able only to give an opinion on the own-resources resolution? The Commission's view on all these questions is that, no, what we have at present is not enough, and change is urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">When taking decisions on the own resources, it follows that the sensitivities of the Council and of the national parliaments must also be taken into account. Even so, the European Parliament should be accorded the right of codecision in this area too. The financial structure should reflect the fact that the EU is a union of Member States and of citizens. The Commission has therefore, in its proposal, advocated more direct involvement in financing the European Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the Budget procedure, the Commission shares the position stated in Parliament's report, that the Budget procedure should be simplified and resources concentrated. The Commission should submit a draft to Parliament, and the first reading in Parliament should be followed by one reading in Council, followed by a consultation and the second reading in Parliament. If this procedure were to be adopted, the amendment of Council resolutions would require a super-qualified majority in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also full agreement between the positions of Parliament and the Commission as regards the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, a distinction that could not, in any case, be made clearer to the public and justified to them. I really do hope that there will be absolute consensus in the Convention, and that this distinction and the consequent curtailment of Parliament's budgetary rights will become a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The constitution's financial chapter should describe the whole of the Budget process in simple words and with unambiguous rules. It should therefore also refer to the implementation of the Budget and specify not only the Commission's responsibilities but also the Member States' obligation to cooperate. It should give a fixed place to the discharge for the Budget, and impose on the Community and the Member States the obligation of safeguarding the Community's finances against fraud. It should, with this in mind, at last enshrine the possibility of instituting the office of Public Prosecutor at Community level. The public expect Community assets to be able to be protected effectively and fraud to result in criminal prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention now affords us the opportunity to establish new rules, appropriate to the Union's development, for the European Budget, which is an important Community instrument. This debate is being held just at the right moment, as the Convention is at this very moment working on the financial chapter; the Convention should adopt this important report by Parliament, and the Commission, in its proposals to it, will be putting forward clear principles and provisions that will, in particular, put the case for Parliament to enjoy full budgetary rights. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His is an excellent report. I am delighted it has been favourably received by all the political groups. I should like to point out to Mr Wynn that even as disparate a group as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats only intends to table a single amendment. This is an indication of the scale of our effort to achieve consensus and support the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, my group strongly supports adjustment of the current system of distinguishing between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. This has now become a common position of Parliament. It should always be taken into account when specific types of expenditure can be guaranteed, notably in the case of agriculture. We endorse most of the proposals put forward by the Convention’s working groups seeking to ensure the principle of a dual budgetary authority: Parliament and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party is of the opinion that the most effective way of ensuring this comes about is to formalise a balance between both branches of the budgetary authority. The budget would be adopted by a codecision procedure adjusted to this specific case. In the event of failure to reach agreement, the Council would have the final say on income and Parliament on expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the financial perspectives, we believe it is imperative to endow them with greater flexibility. This would ensure an effective response to unexpected situations. Unduly rigid provisions have sometimes served to safeguard expenditure. On other occasions, however, such rigidity has hindered more effective allocation of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully endorse the proposal by the Convention’s working group to include financial perspectives in the treaty, together with provisions on discipline and budgetary cooperation. In the interests of providing continuity regarding financial decisions, financial perspectives should cover the five-year term of Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, reform of the budgetary procedure must be based on simplification with a view to greater democratisation, legitimacy and transparency. We therefore fully endorse the proposal to do away with first reading in the Council, as this seems to be consistent with the objective of simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, we reject the amendments leading beyond this debate, as we wish the document presented to the Convention to enjoy the fullest possible support of the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, history has shown that the budget is the cornerstone of representative democracies. They can only flourish if Parliament controls the sovereign’s expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the point of adopting the first European constitution. The Union has been in existence for 46 years and budgetary powers have remained unchanged for the last 30. I therefore believe updating is imperative. Several points are now obsolete. In addition, if the treaty were applied to the letter it would not be in line with the reality of present day budgets. Mr Garriga Polledo referred to budgetary perspectives a moment ago. There is no provision for these in the treaty, though the Council often seems to be unaware of that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the constitution must encompass the budgetary process and own resources. The mantra of seventeenth century revolutions was ‘<span class="italic">no taxation without representation</span>’. Precisely the opposite applies in the European Union. There is strong democratic representation in the form of this House, but taxation is not approved democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, the own resources system amounts to national contributions by another name, even though these are legally the Union’s own resources. This cannot be allowed to continue. Resources should henceforth come directly from the citizen. The citizen would then understand that taxes are destined to the Union’s budget. This is a basic feature of democratic responsibility. Otherwise, Finance Ministers will go on collecting the money and the Community will go on spending it and the reasons will remain unclear. This is bad for democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to move towards a system enabling this connection to be made without increasing the total tax burden on the citizens. Personal and possibly progressive taxation should be introduced. It would then no longer be possible to allege, as is often the case, that unemployed citizens in eastern Germany are subsidising large landowners in Andalusia. Please excuse this crude simplification. The result is unhealthy populism. It is essential to ensure that it will no longer be possible to distinguish between the various countries’ contributions under any future financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">A citizen’s contribution should be based on his or her personal resources. It should not depend on his or her place of residence. In my view, this must be a key feature of the new approach, that is, of the new way of tackling the system of resources.</p>

I give him my most sincere thanks for that. Nevertheless, my group is not completely satisfied with the end result. We have chosen not to table any amendments, because it would result in a kind of hotchpotch, but instead to table an alternative resolution. We have opted to do that precisely because absolute clarity is necessary when it comes to establishing the form the budgetary procedure of the future should take. For example, we also wanted to make it very clear right from the outset how competences should be divided up. The Council and Parliament should negotiate with each other to reach common agreement both on the structure and the ceiling of the financial resources for the EU budget and on the annual or multi-annual expenditure. Should the negotiations fail, the Council would simply have the last word on revenue and Parliament on expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution, we also keep repeating the necessity of having codecision powers in all legislation. It is all very well to argue for an end to the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, but if we do not also have the power or codecision over the legislation, we are often left empty-handed. Then a situation can arise in which we do have codecision over agricultural expenditure but in which we are obliged to simply hand out money to farmers because they have a right to it under European law. In addition, the judgment of the Court of Justice on the legal basis has taught us that we cannot take any budgetary decisions in our own right without a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude that budgetary codecision is of no benefit to us as a Parliament if we do not have legislative codecision. The two matters must go hand in hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, he will understand if, from my group's perspective, I cannot go along with the suggestion that we abolish the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. I signal openly to the rapporteur that I will seek to remove this suggestion from what, as I have already said, is otherwise a very constructive report.</p>
<p class="contents">The distinction is there for one simple reason and it has served its purpose well down the years. That reason is to depoliticise decision-making when it comes to the agricultural budget. Farming is perhaps the industry in the most precarious position in the European Union at present. There are onslaughts on farm income from left, right and centre. I will not attempt to outline my objection to the CAP reform proposals in today's budget debate, but I wish to make one very short and simple point: farmers need to plan ahead and they need policy stability. Exposing the common agricultural budget to the vagaries of annual political battles in the European Parliament will wreak untold havoc on farm income and on the viability and competitivity of the European farm sector vis-à-vis the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the House to consider this when voting tomorrow. Farm income in Ireland and many other Member States is very much dependent on the direct income support from the European Union budget. Stability arises from the fact that such expenditure has hitherto derived from legally binding assurances and we must continue to give these assurances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, year after year, reform after reform, the budgetary procedure has been amended on an informal basis, by means of political agreements between the various institutions involved. These informal amendments have rendered the current text redundant and obsolete. The next constitutional Treaty must contain articles covering the principles that govern the budget and the procedures for approving it.</p>
<p class="contents">As a contribution to the debate on this report that the Committee on Budgets has presented on its own initiative, I wish first of all to congratulate our Chairman and rapporteur, Terence Wynn on his commitment and on the exemplary quality of his work.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to express my full and unequivocal agreement with the proposals for reform that have been tabled. Firstly, because I believe we must seize this opportunity to review the issue of the European Union’s funding. More Europe means, amongst other things, more money. The contribution of the Member States must be appropriate and in proportion to the objectives that the European Union wishes to achieve. It is entirely utopian to set objectives, such as those of the Lisbon Summit, which uphold the current financial framework. It should be added that the European Union itself must undertake a thoroughgoing study into its own resources for funding the EU budget. Secondly, because I can see that, in addition to these new challenges, a new reality is approaching: a European Union with 25 Member States. In this context, the Structural Funds will reveal their fundamental importance, on the one hand, to achieving economic and social cohesion in the new States and, on the other, to continuing the progress that has been made in the current Member States. Thirdly, because I believe that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and their respective procedures has become artificial. I am therefore in favour of a complete revision of the procedures, giving the European Parliament greater power to act by means of the codecision procedure, thereby achieving an equal footing with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, budgetary expenditure for the common agricultural policy (CAP) would then be studied by the European Parliament under the codecision procedure. If it is adopted, this measure would represent an historical development for the European Parliament, which has been forced to remain at a distance in political terms from the CAP since its inception, despite the fact that the CAP today accounts for more than 50% of the EU’s total budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater involvement of the European Parliament in the CAP can only be positive for farmers and for rural development. This will provide greater control over the use of funds. I would remind you that every year, enormous sums intended for the CAP end up being refunded to the Member States because they have not been properly used. It is also worth adding that the CAP is becoming increasingly diffuse, incorporating new dimensions, such as rural development, conservation of the environment and food safety and quality, and consequently requires funding that corresponds to this new state of affairs, which is of the utmost importance to European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last week, Eurostat published data that warrants our utmost interest: European citizens, including those of the future Member States, feel that the CAP’s priorities should be food safety and support for improving rural life.</p>
<p class="contents">By the European Parliament having this greater ability to act, the economic, social and environmental interests of European farmers will be safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haug (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, our debate is being conducted under the heading of ‘reform of the budgetary procedure’, which is a modest title for an ambitious enterprise. It would probably be more appropriate to speak in terms of a reform of the financial constitution, for we want the Convention to produce a coherent draft for a constitution that will advance European integration. We want the Treaty to be underpinned by democratic legitimacy, to be transparent and effective, and to give the public unambiguous answers to their questions as to what the federation of states and peoples called Europe can – and must – achieve in the interests of its citizens. The European Union's Budget must enjoy the very same democratic legitimacy in its function of financing European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we urgently need, then, is not just changes to the Budget procedure, but a reform of our public finances, and what this will require is plain for all to see, encapsulated in our demand for all Budget areas to be subject to the codecision procedure – even decisions on the own-resources system, the structure of which is in need of fundamental change. Whilst it has to be admitted that the present system of finance works, it meets with criticism quite apart from its undemocratic nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither what we receive from VAT or out of gross domestic income can really be described as the European Union's own resources. The fact is that they are transfers from the Member States, and that is precisely the argument used by the Member States when the positions of net contributors are under discussion. It is not immediately evident to the public which taxes go towards financing the EU's outgoings. The proportion of what are termed traditional own resources is decreasing all the time, and the whole system is mutating from genuine self-financing into the transfer of lump sums.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does what we call the British rebate have any rationale behind it any more, Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Wynn, and, wearing only my one hat – in my capacity as rapporteur for the PSE on own resources – I can tell you that, in that area too, the British rebate makes no sense any longer, any more than does its being funded in different ways by the other Member States. It should be abolished!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The structure of the Budget has ceased to provide any justification for it. Changes have had to be made in the structure of the European Budget's expenditure over the past fifteen years. Policies already in existence, such the agriculture policy, were reformed, and other policy areas were added, such as structural policy and pre-accession aid, and this renders obsolete the imposition of an unfair burden on everyone else by preferential treatment for Great Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">All this leads to the logical conclusion that we should introduce a tax to replace the former own resources, and that this should be done without imposing additional burdens on European taxpayers, who would, though, be able to see, at last, how they are funding the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us in this Parliament, then, not demand less than the Commission has already done, but, rather, join together in taking a great step towards greater transparency and democracy.</p>

We can all, therefore, understand its importance. Reforming the budgetary procedure is by no means a technical issue that can only be handled by specialists. Quite the opposite: it is an eminently political subject: it concerns our ability to give substance to European integration and demonstrate our solidarity through action.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally would simply like to remind the participants in the current negotiations of their responsibilities. That means going beyond the sterile little game of defending national privileges and territory in the short term. That kind of attitude never leads to successful negotiations, ending instead with lame compromises which, at the end of the day, do not satisfy anyone. It is time we looked to see where the true interests of Europeans as a whole lie. We need to create a virtuous circle where the concessions made by the various parties ultimately benefit everyone. If this state of mind is allowed to triumph, I think it will be possible to seize the opportunity provided by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore have the political courage necessary to demand a genuine reform which, I reiterate, includes, specifically, removing the distinction between mandatory and non-mandatory spending, establishing a European tax and laying down uniform rules for all the Member States. The Convention must establish a genuine codecision procedure, within which framework Parliament and the Council can work together as equals to handle all aspects of the Community budget and the other financial instruments available to European politicians. This method alone will make it possible to strengthen the democratic nature of the European budget decisively and to bring the citizens closer to our institutions, as we want with all our hearts.</p>
