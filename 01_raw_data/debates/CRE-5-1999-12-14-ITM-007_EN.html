The composition of the body was fixed in Tampere and its first meeting will take place next Friday, 17 December.</p>
<p class="contents">The nature of the Charter is a very fundamental question, nevertheless the European Council left the question open. According to the conclusions, it will have to be considered whether and, if so, how the charter should be integrated into the Treaties. Although it is up to the Heads of State and Government to decide the definitive status of the Charter, in its proposal the body will have to consider how to combine two open questions: a legally binding text ready to be inserted into the Treaty, or a solemn political declaration. These reflections will also take into account the close connection with the IGC preparatory work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, the European Union Charter should respond to two different concerns: visibility and security. As far as visibility is concerned, one could argue that a political declaration solemnly proclaimed by the European institutions and relayed by all channels of communication will be enough. On the legal security aspect, we must consider how the European Union Charter can contribute to improving the degree of protection of fundamental rights within the European Union and it is difficult to see how a non-binding text could contribute to clarifying and transcending the current system of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, the Charter to be presented to the Heads of State and Government must carry real added value and the best way to achieve this is to focus on the fundamental rights arising from the Union itself. The body will have to find a way to attain a politically significant text compatible with insertion into the Treaty. There are clear indications that drafting of the Charter is broadly welcomed and that citizens expect it to be a founding text on the matter. The Commission is convinced that those expectations should not be disappointed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Renewal of concessions for motorway companies in Italy</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Italian government intends to renew the concessions of the 20 companies which currently manage the Italian motorways. After approving the concession for Autostrade, a stock company which manages approximately 50% of the Italian motorway system, it is proposing to renew the concessions of the 19 other, smaller companies. In exchange, the companies propose making enormous investments worth some ITL 20,000 billion in new motorways. Does the Commission not feel that renewing the concessions is an infringement of the directives on the awarding of public supply contracts (92/50/EEC<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, 93/37/EEC<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and 89/440/EEC<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>), given that there was no public European call for tenders and any other EU company was therefore excluded from this important market? Does the Commission not think that the companies’ offer to create new infrastructure is a means of defending their monopoly position, and that the construction work runs counter to the EU’s policy of a more responsible balance between the different forms of transport? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission would point out to the honourable Member of Parliament that there are three infringement procedures currently running concerning these issues. The procedure concerning Autostrade s.p.a. could well have a positive outcome in the light of the fact that the Italian authorities have expressed their willingness to work together with the Commission in unison and have taken steps towards privatising the company. Given the major consequences which this case might have, the Commission will, however, continue to monitor the process and the dossier will not be closed before the Commission has ascertained that the principles of transparency and equal treatment are upheld. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other concessions, the Commission has initiated two infringement procedures and is investigating the issues related to them. Given their economic, political and social significance, these matters will also be discussed at a meeting with the Italian authorities which will take place very soon. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to tackle this general issue in a more structural way, the Commission has, in fact, recently launched a horizontal inquiry into the current situation within all Member States, to identify common problems and problems which are only specific to a certain Member State. If this inquiry will bring possible infringements to light, then the Commission will take further steps to solve these problems. </p>
<p class="contents">The new investments in infrastructure undertaken by Italy do not necessarily contravene the EU’s transport policy. Although the Member States are responsible for taking decisions regarding such investments, the Commission is of the opinion that these must be based on the positive outcome of a complete social cost and benefit analysis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all waiting for an answer. But I would ask you to consider in this connection that we should perhaps take this opportunity to provide for dovetailing the Commission services responsible for transport and the services responsible for competition if we are to make progress with transport policy decisions in Europe in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We must and we want to shift heavy traffic onto the railways. The positive example here of the award of the Brenner motorway concession for the purpose of investing in a basic Brenner tunnel could perhaps be used as an example throughout Europe. I would like to digress briefly to point out that the Brenner motorway concession is to be awarded, but has not yet been awarded on condition or with the promise that money from the motorway will be transferred to the basic Brenner tunnel, i.e. to the railways. If the Commission services responsible for transport and competition were to work together, we could take an important step forward in a policy to shift heavy traffic from the roads to the railways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not only say this on my own behalf, but also certainly on behalf of fellow Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, who, as you know, is responsible for the transport policy. This matter undoubtedly has our undivided attention. I would very much like to respond to Mr Messner’s question and reiterate that the onus is on the Member State to adopt its own transport policy. Naturally, we hope that, as far as possible, this policy will be in line with the transport policy of other Member States and that of the Commission itself. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the shift of freight from road to rail, I would like to observe that the point made by Mr Messner deserves a great deal of attention. I can assure him that in various Member States, an opinion-forming process is under way which aims to ensure that the shift which he advocates is carried out. It is, of course, a fact that the transport of freight by road carries an element of flexibility which rail does not have. This does not take away from the fact that rail transport is eminently suitable for long-distance transport, also because – and this will be very dear to Mr Messner – the surroundings and the environment suffer less damage as a result. Concerning the concession regarding transport over the Brenner Pass, as mentioned by Mr Messner, this concession is still outstanding. The Commission will find out how this concession will be granted because – and this is also the topic of current discussion – of course, concessions cannot be granted until the conditions which should be tied in with the granting of concessions in general, are sufficiently met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One could, of course, reason from the liberal principle that anything scarce should become expensive. In this case, it is road space which is scarce so one could say that this scarceness must be translated into higher prices. The total cost remains the same, of course. The total cost is what it is. But there is a shift from public funding of these expenses towards the private user of this road space. I can assure the honourable MEP that, for example, in a Member State which I happen to know best, the topic of road pricing should receive a great deal of attention but is politically also very controversial. </p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the topic is definitely on the agenda but has not yet reached the stage where decisions can be taken and as far as I know – but the honourable MEP is aware that this is not within my remit, so I am speaking with some circumlocution and caution – such a directive is not in the pipeline at the European Commission as yet. </p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Quality in education and the school curriculum</span></p>
<p class="contents">In June 1998 in Prague the Conference of Education Ministers of the EU Member States and of other countries applying to join the EU issued a brief calling for a set of indicators to be identified which would enable the education systems of the various countries to be assessed. As the Commission announced at the Council meeting of 26 November, the ad-hoc Committee of Experts has already prepared a second interim paper on reference levels and indicators. This will serve as a basis for the First European Report on Education Quality which is to be submitted at the next conference, to be held in Bucharest in June 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the progress being made in this area and the importance which the Council attaches to cooperation amongst the Member States with a view to developing quality in education as a means of helping to create jobs and improve economic performance, does the Commission not think that a Standing Committee of Experts from the EU Member States and the applicant countries should be set up to consider teaching quality? </p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not think that, pursuant to Article 149(1) of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Committee of Experts could be instructed to draw up criteria or recommendations for the establishment of a common school curriculum to be run in parallel with the existing curriculum in each of the countries concerned, particularly in the early years of schooling? </p>

The recommendation on quality evaluation and higher education adopted in September 1998 and a proposed recommendation on quality evaluation in school education give evidence of the importance of discussing quality of education at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council of Education Ministers on 26 November, the theme gained further importance as one of the priorities to be treated during the next years through the adoption of a resolution on a rolling agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Conference of European Ministers of Education in Prague in June 1998, a working committee on quality indicators was set up. It includes representatives from 26 European countries and it has prepared progress reports for the attention of Ministers – one in June and one in October of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The first European report on quality of education will be presented for the education council for the Conference of European Ministers of Education in Bucharest in June 2000, and for this Parliament. In the light of the discussions on the report, the Commission will propose how to treat indicators and benchmarks of quality of education within the framework of the rolling agenda and the yearly Conference of European Ministers of Education. The present working committee has proved to be an important forum for discussion and for exchange of information and experiences about quality policies between Member States and acceding countries. The Commission intends to propose that the committee continue its work.</p>
<p class="contents">The European work on indicators and benchmarks will lead to discussions about reasons for differences in performance between education systems. Explanatory factors like the curriculum, teacher-training, resources, evaluation and so on are discussed within the working committee on quality indicators and at a ministerial level. Countries participating in the working committee profit from the exchange of information and experiences on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the active participation of the European Parliament on the issue of quality of education, particularly in the forthcoming discussion on indicators and benchmarks of quality education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the legal basis of Article 149 provides us with the opportunity to move forward a little more than the cautious Prague mandate. The concept of quality in education is more than a quantitative measure of the resources of the different systems or an evaluation of performance in certain academic disciplines.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, the agenda of the Council of Education Ministers of 26 November could have made use of the proposal of a permanent committee on quality in education.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the results of the first European report on quality in education, which this Parliament will take good note of, would it be possible for this committee or some other form of committee to provide common benchmarks in the area of the curriculum?</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to face this challenge with political courage. We must go beyond the Prague mandate. We must go beyond the old debate between uniformity and national idiosyncrasies. The debate on quality in education must help us to duly open up European consciousness to the younger generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However I have to say with the very greatest respect to the honourable Lady that it is not accurate to say that women are excluded from those posts, nor is it accurate to attribute chauvinist motives to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1988, the Commission has adopted three action programmes with the aim of promoting positive actions and equal opportunities for women within its services. Special attention has been attached to increasing the proportion of women in management and in middle-management posts. In 1996 an evaluation of the impact of the two positive action programmes on achieving equal opportunities in the Commission revealed that there had been significant changes in the situation of female staff in Category A and in management posts, particularly as a result of the annual targets adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">While women accounted for 11.5% of Category A staff in 1992, they represented 19.3% of staff in that category in September of this year. Women occupied approximately 2% of A2, that is to say director, posts in 1992. That rose to 11% by September of this year. The third action programme for equal opportunities for women and men at the Commission, 1997-2000, should consolidate what has already been achieved and go further along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst noting these advances I emphasise very strongly that the Commission is not complacent. On 29 September, the new Commission expressed its commitment to taking further positive action to ensure that a higher number of women obtain posts in senior management positions. Specific proposals will consequently be made in the course of the forthcoming reform strategy. Meanwhile the honourable Member will be interested to know that last Wednesday the Commission adopted a policy proposal which I put forward on merit, equal opportunities and geographical balance. That policy includes positive action to be taken to improve the career prospects of women civil servants. The college resolved that when there are male and female candidates for senior posts the woman candidate will be given preference. In addition, the Commission will strive to double the proportion of senior posts taken by women by the end of this mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, progress is being made. My colleagues and I would like it to be faster and broader. We are working on that. We hope that other institutions – maybe including this one – will take a similar course, especially so far as senior management positions are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, Commissioner, I have to point out that in this area of making women’s representation the norm, the Commission has had a hypocritical attitude for more than twenty years. Its attitude has been a hypocritical “I would like to, but I cannot”, and this hypocritical impotency sends a very damaging signal to the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">My question did not talk of exclusion, as you know very well; it talked of the fact that the number of women in high positions stands at barely 10%. The figures which you have offered – emphatically – here in the plenum of the European Parliament, are ridiculous and shameful. An institution such as the European Commission, which has for years claimed to be in favour of women also at the highest levels of administration, cannot be satisfied with that exclusion which the figures demonstrate.

<p class="contents">First of all, if she has a complaint about the lack of women representatives at ministerial level in Member States, I suggest she takes it up with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have specifically said, not only in this House now, but over many years and also in the actions I have taken in the twelve weeks I have been the person responsible in the Commission, that we are definitely not satisfied with the number of women in senior posts or indeed in the "A" categories generally in the Commission. But instead of just talking about it I am trying to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that in an institution like Parliament where just one director – I repeat, <span class="underline">one</span> director – out of ten is a woman then there is some reflection on the situation in this institution too. I will provide whatever help I can with counselling about the promotion of equality between the genders, and then I do not think the Commission could be accused of hypocrisy. There has been a consistent effort to increase the numbers of women; there is evidence of that. Maybe the honourable Member would like to take it up with the various Member States, to encourage participation at the lower grades of "A" category in order to ensure that, as the years go by, there will be more women <span class="underline">available</span> to take up management posts. Here again, I am working in practical terms instead of merely waving my arms around, in order to try specifically to encourage that.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the 10% being ridiculous and shameful, I would suggest that whilst the Commission could and should have done more, that is not a result of any lack of motivation or effort. A Commission which, twelve weeks into its term of office, has made the absolute commitment to strive for a doubling of the numbers over five years is one that deserves patience, if not praise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Bridges across the Danube in former Yugoslavia</span></p>
<p class="contents">As well as military installations, numerous civil targets were damaged or even destroyed during NATO's bombing raids in Kosovo and/or Serbia, including the bridges across the Danube, the collapsed sections of which are still obstructing navigation on the Danube and thus significantly hampering economic reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is likely that, in the coming winter, the collapsed concrete sections will cause further problems, as they are still resting on the river bed, and many experts fear they could cause accumulations of ice which they have prevented from flowing downstream.</p>
<p class="contents">The logical consequence would be for the barriers of ice to cause the level of the Danube to rise considerably, which could cause severe flooding, which in turn would increase reconstruction costs, and this cannot be in the Commission's interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of this situation and has it already come up with proposals or promised financial assistance to help resolve this specific problem? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is aware of the important economic implications of the destruction of the bridges over the Danube for the riparian countries. It affects not just the bilateral economic relations between Serbia and neighbouring countries, but also other countries along the river, which have traditionally used it as a navigation route between the Rhine and the Black Sea. Concerns have also been expressed regarding the potential for flooding upstream. These concerns were recognised by the General Affairs Council at its meeting on 15 November.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member is no doubt aware that the authorities in Belgrade are attempting to put pressure on the international community to lift the sanctions against the FRY and rebuild the destroyed bridges by making the re-opening of the Serbian sections of the Danube to navigation conditional upon assistance from the international community to rebuild the bridges. This is unacceptable. With the Danube Commission, the Commission is examining the possibilities for clearing the Danube. We want to be able to help, difficult as the task may be, but we are determined to prevent any clearance of the Danube from being manipulated by the FRY authorities into support for Mr Milosevic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I should add this: however much one invests in the infrastructure – and we will be looking at specific pledges at the donors' conference early in the new year – however much one spends on infrastructure, what is crucial is to encourage greater and freer trade between the countries of the region, and even in one or two countries within the countries of the region.

<p class="contents">Despite serious evidence of illegal trafficking in nuclear chemical and biological (NCB) weapons-grade materials, no serious steps are being taken to combat the problem. At the same time multilateral deliberations on this matter and agreements on the monitoring of NBC materials are proving inadequate. According to many rumours and reports, these networks are situated mainly in the Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Russia and the illegal trading activities are centred mainly in Constantinople and Budapest, while much of the trafficking is carried out through channels in the Balkans many of which go through Kosovo. What view does the Commission take of this major problem and what is its attitude towards those countries within whose territory this dangerous and illegal trafficking is taking place, particularly where there is evidence of a cover-up and especially in view of the fact that some of the countries involved are seeking EU membership or association? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A good deal has in fact been done. But the Commission's legal powers have been limited to civilian aspects of nuclear accounting and control under the Euratom Treaty. This means that the Commission does not have any mandate to deal with the accounting and control of weapons of mass destruction per se. It is only under the evolving CFSP that Member States are considering expanding EU action to include some initiatives to reduce stocks of weapons of mass destruction. Member States and the Commission are currently discussing a joint action due for adoption before the end of this year to implement the security and non-proliferation aspects of the common strategy on Russia. In this joint action, which includes concrete action to destroy stocks of chemical weapons, the Commission has been asked to coordinate European Union action. We stand ready to take this important additional task on board in consultation with the Member States and Mr Solana and working closely, we hope, with the Russian authorities. The Commission is heavily engaged in efforts to combat smuggling of nuclear material and radioactive substances. The Commission initiated a series of special actions to support national authorities involved in combating illicit nuclear traffic from both EU Member States and candidate States, including seminars, training programmes and technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euratom safeguards office in Luxembourg, in addition to its specific control tasks on the territory of the European Union, has undertaken a series of related outreach activities since 1992. There is close coordination under the auspices of the G8 and the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Preventative actions in the form of cooperation programmes have been carried out since 1992 with central and east European countries, including Russia. There are areas such as training and strengthening national nuclear material accounting and control systems.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards our cooperation with EU candidate countries, cooperation with customs, border control and police institutions is well established under the PHARE horizontal programme on justice and home affairs. These measures help to reduce the dangers stemming from uncontrolled nuclear weapons material. However, the Commission recognises the formidable and rapidly-evolving challenge in this field and hopes to be able to address the issue more comprehensively once we have been given the appropriate legal mandates.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Colombian Government is currently working on the details of Plan Colombia. Colombia will continue to need strong backing from the international community. The specific areas where Colombia would like support, including financial support from the European Union and others, still need to be agreed more precisely. The Commission has already indicated its willingness to support a peace process in Colombia within the framework of Plan Colombia, as it has done in several countries in Central America in recent years. The Commission would of course take all necessary steps before delivering Community aid to ensure that all parties respect their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the Commission is focusing on aid for internally displaced persons, on average between EUR 7 million and EUR 8 million per annum, and financially supports a series of initiatives intended to promote human rights in the country. The Commission covers the bulk of the costs of running the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights in Colombia and has just approved a multiannual programme to support human rights in the Andean region with funding of approximately EUR 11.5 million, the bulk of which will be dedicated to Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also very much appreciate your statement on funding a plan to support Colombia, provided that the commitments that were made are met. Unfortunately, according to Human Rights Watch, some high-level military representatives, who are recognisable, whose names are known and who are responsible for military training and have been involved in various massacres, have still not been removed from their posts, while the terrible collusion<span class="bold"> </span>between the military and paramilitary groups continues. I therefore think what Commissioner Patten said is important: these things must not be allowed to go unpunished and they must not be shrouded in silence.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased to learn – and I confess my lack of knowledge on the subject – that there are plans, even important ones, regarding evacuees, humanitarian aid and committees on human rights. I wonder whether, in view of the peace talks, the Commission can massively increase the aid given to social movements in Colombia and to associations for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our aid goes primarily to the people who are themselves the victims of human rights violations, or refugees who have had to flee from their homes and from their land. It is precisely these people who most need our support and precisely these people whom we are trying to support the most. President Pastrana was in Europe a few weeks ago. I think I am right in saying he gave a speech in this Parliament about Plan Colombia and I enjoyed my conversations with him during that visit. He indicated that he will be putting forward concrete proposals next February for how the European Union could support Plan Colombia. When we receive those proposals I will be happy to discuss them with Parliament and to do so in the context of Parliament's understandable concern about some of the reports of human rights violations which alas continue and continue to be reported by reputable organisations such as the one the honourable Member referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to take the most serious account of human rights violations. We will do what we can to help those who have had their human rights abused. I want to refer once again to those who have suffered or even been killed in trying to implement our own European programmes in Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that there is an office for the defence of human rights in Colombia. For several years Parliament asked for it, and finally the Commission, together with the United Nations, finances this human rights office in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, those of us who have been here for years know what the words “displaced” (800 000) and “murdered” mean in relation to Colombia. As well as the Spaniard Egiluz and the Colombian priest Mazo, two journalists have been murdered in recent days. 150 journalists have been murdered in the last ten years. In many cases, it is perfectly clear that it is the paramilitary groups who are carrying out these murders.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that this is a difficult and complex matter, but, Commissioner, I would like to ask you two questions. Firstly, do you not think that, as well as talking and maintaining dialogue – which in my opinion should always be done -, we should put pressure on the Colombian Government so that, once and for all, it will try to get rid of the paramilitary groups responsible for these acts?</p>
<p class="contents">And secondly, is there any truth in the rumours that, in the name of the fight against drug trafficking, the United States may be planning an intervention strategy in Colombia?</p>
<p class="contents">And I believe that the European Union should act decisively in that event, because such an intervention would lead to a spiral of violence which none of us want to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the first point that she mentioned, I do not think that the Colombian Government would disagree with the importance of dealing with the paramilitaries. It is its capacity to deal with them militarily which has been one of the problems over the years. I very much hope that the present negotiations will deliver to the people of Colombia the peace which they deserve. In the meantime, what worries me, and I think worries the honourable Member, is the very serious security situation for human rights activists in Colombia. They have to be extraordinarily brave to do the important work that they do. There is a limit to the amount we can do ourselves to increase their personal security though we continue to press our concern about that matter on the Colombian authorities. We will go on doing so. We also try to monitor the situation very closely with the Member States' embassies in Bogotá. So we do our best, but it does remain a subject to me of very great concern that so many people, young people for instance, are having to put their lives at risk to try to secure human rights in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just as important, FYROM is the first country to become actively involved in the European Union's stabilisation and association process. The Council should adopt the negotiating mandate for a stabilisation and association agreement in January. The year 2000, therefore, augurs well for a substantial increase in cooperation between the European Union and FYROM. It will be a year of negotiation and, we hope, a year which will culminate in the signature of an agreement.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Gaming houses</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice has ruled that the organisation of games of chance is an economic activity constituting the provision of services and falling within the scope of the EC Treaty and that the measures adopted by a Member State with regard to the award of licences to open gaming houses must be proportionate and non-discriminatory (Case C275/92, Schindler). The Italian Government requires proof of effectiveness as a tourist attraction and of the sound financial standing of applicants. It does not however define those criteria, which leads to arbitrary decision making in many cases. Up to now only four casinos have opened as the result of all the licences granted in Italy (in the United Kingdom there are 119 casinos and in Germany approximately 102). All the casinos are located in Northern Italy. This clearly leads to discrimination against the regions coming within Objective 1. In terms of tourist revenue and economic expansion, those regions could benefit greatly from the opening of gaming houses. Does the Commission believe that the conduct of the Italian Government amounts to an infringement of the Community rules against discrimination and on free competition, having regard in particular to Articles 12 and 86 of the Treaty?</p>

The Court recently confirmed that, even if a Member State authorises games of chance, it still has the power to impose limits on the availability of these games and this is in consideration of public interest objectives, such as controlling the desire to play games of chance, the prevention of fraud or crimes occurring and using the profits thus obtained in the public interest. Each Member State has the power to determine the extent of protection in its territory as regards games of chance. The Commission is therefore unable to object to the fact that currently in Italy, only four gaming houses have been authorised and that they are located in Northern Italy, since there is nothing that leads us to believe that foreign businesses are being discriminated against, with regard to national businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, the Italian Government denied the request made by a clearly tourist-oriented local authority, Taormina, to establish a gaming house and, at the same time, it authorised Venice casino to open a branch in Mestre. According to the Commission, does all of this not constitute clear discrimination within a Member State, and moreover, does it not force the inhabitants who would like to play in central and southern regions to go to other Member States – there are hundreds of gaming houses in Europe – rather than staying and playing in Northern Italy, which does not hold great appeal? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition rules do not raise objections to the criteria that a Member State may use and therefore based on those rules, we cannot consider the decision a Member State makes on the distribution in their territory to be arbitrary, and consequently, a violation of these rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 49 by Eduard Beysen (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0684_EN.html">H-0684/99</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Communication pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation 19/65/EEC of the Council of 2 March 1965</span></p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission given due thought to the peculiar nature and diversity of the catering sector in Belgium, which is renowned for its wealth of congenial cafés with countless different types of beer, and the impact which introduction of the regulation<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> would have, in particular the fact that managers of small establishments would suffer? In the absence of brewery contracts, firms with a large share of the market will stop investing in the cafés where they sell their products; instead they will spend the money on mass advertising to consolidate their market position. There will obviously be a bitter price war which would have a detrimental effect not only on the smaller breweries but also on managers of establishments. Is the Commission aware of the fact that the market leaders not only sell their products but often also provide financial support (attractive loans), material support (dispensing equipment, furniture and glasses etc.) and technical support (refrigerating engineers)?</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the question is about the sale of beer in Belgium in such mysterious quantities. The Commissioner has the floor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think I have understood what Mr Beysen’s question is. The Commission is aware that breweries often provide café owners with financial, material and technical support. Nevertheless, the Commission does not share the fear, voiced by Mr Beysen, that the proposed new policy on vertical restrictions could harm Belgian breweries or the hotels, restaurants and cafés sectors. On the contrary, effective competition will guarantee consumers good service in terms of numbers of bars and the variety of beers they offer. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the proposed exemption per category of agreements exempts contracts on the supply of beer that contain a clause prohibiting competition, entered into between brewers who have a market share lower than 30% and owners of bar or commercial concerns. For Belgian breweries, this means that they will all, with the exception of <span class="italic">Interbrew</span>, be able to continue to operate on the basis of the current distribution agreements.<span class="italic"> </span>Moreover, the proposed exemption per generalised category allows these breweries greater contractual freedom compared with their freedom on the basis of the current specific exemption in the sector. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proposed exemption per category does not presuppose that non-competition agreements, entered into with a brewery with a market share greater than 30%, are illegal. A brewery that reaches this market share can notify the Commission of its network of non-competition agreements. The Commission will then, firstly, evaluate the actual impact of the competition agreements; if the impact is considerable, the Commission can in any case take into account the economic benefits of these non-competition agreements<span class="bold"> </span>in its evaluation of the possible applicability of an individual exemption under Article 81(3) to the agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if an individual exemption is not applicable to the agreements, the Commission will examine the possible solutions within the existing distribution system. In other words, the Commission will attempt, as a matter of principle, to resolve any competition issues that might occur, firstly by amending the existing agreements, taking into account the economic benefits they bring. Mr Beysen will certainly agree that because of its role as the European authority on competition, the Commission must assess very carefully the agreements entered into between operators who benefit from considerable market force. Indeed, because of their possible effects of closing the market, these agreements can jeopardise competition, not only with regard to producers in other Member States, but also with regard to small Belgian breweries. This is another reason why the Commission recently launched proceedings against <span class="italic">Interbrew</span>.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"> </span></p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, the Commission does not believe that the new policy on vertical restrictions is liable to bring about major structural changes, in the beer, hotels, restaurants and cafés sectors in Belgium, which would put the beer culture in that country at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, Commissioner, there is still great concern not only from me but also from within the sector with regard to the lack of clarity which currently – fourteen days prior to the coming into force of this regulation – exists regarding the guidelines on what is and is not allowed. Although your explanation has shed some light on the matter, I think it is appropriate to also inform the sector of this. </p>
<p class="contents">My question in this respect is why should the system be changed if so far, its application has not resulted in any complaints?

There are plenty of others where people in the United Kingdom and, for all I know, other Member States, are being exploited by companies.

Indeed I believe that serving the interests of consumers is the cornerstone of competition policy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we claim that a single market is really single only when there is unity of prices? I would not say so, because there will always be factors explaining certain price differentials. Indeed, we might even perhaps consider that perfect unity of prices in a given market may be an indication of some sort of cartel prevailing in that market. Having said that, I agree with you that a lot of price divergences in the present-day single market are explained by the frictions and obstacles that still exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Two powerful factors are at play today to help the market overcome those divergences and this will be increasingly the case. One is of course the introduction of the euro. That of itself is going to make price comparisons easier. And the second, which is having a powerful effect on the distribution of goods and services, is the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">You ask whether the Commission should not take action vis-à-vis certain instances of considerable price divergences. Yes, we should and do: in particular if we consider the car sector, you will be aware of a number of actions taken in the past and also very recently in the Commission against limitations imposed by car manufacturers on parallel imports of cars. The publication of the comparative list of car prices also goes very much in that direction. The latest edition was published on 22 July 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that the Commission should also use its competition policy instruments for these purposes; and may I submit that it does so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCarthy (PSE).</span></span>   – I am pleased to see that the Commissioner has, along with my own Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Mr Byers, formed the impression that the European car industry has indeed taken UK consumers for a ride. But I have to say that I cannot agree with you that it is a simple exchange rate issue because it would not account for the fact that some cars cost around four thousand pounds more in the UK than they do, for example, in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">If it were only a question of the exchange rate, then prices should also go down with exchange rate variables. Why then, for example, do imported cars – which now represent over 70% of the UK market – get dearer as the pound is getting stronger? How do UK car manufacturers export record numbers of cars to the continent at a time when exporting is more expensive? Why are cars built in the UK cheaper on the continent just as our pound is making our exports more expensive? I am afraid I do not accept the logic of this wholly.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – after an 18 months' investigation by a UK newspaper, following your investigation – that time is running out and the car industry now wants to find a settlement to this issue. If I were to arrange a round table with the industry – with dealers and manufacturers – would you be willing to come along to it and discuss with them how we can find a way through the problem while, at the same time, resorting to competition instruments if we have to? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I draw your attention again to the fact that we have opened a considerable number of investigations concerning restrictions on parallel imports and, in some cases, we have already reached a conclusion by imposing quite considerable fines.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it would be inadequate to attribute price differentials, in cars in particular, only to exchange rates. I mention that as one factor – it is not the only one. Divergences in the taxation of different types of cars are of course a factor but this brings us to the question of how easy or how difficult it is for the European Union to make any decision concerning tax matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I also appreciate your offer of an invitation to a round table. I will be glad to consider that in the context of the various invitations a Commissioner receives.</p>
<p class="contents">You are no doubt aware that we are in the process of preparing a report on the application of the current block exemption regulation which is our main area of reflection at present. We have received many questionnaires in response to our consultation exercise. The report which is due at the end of the year will not as yet contain any proposals but will analyse the impact of the exempted distribution system which is due at the end of 2000 and will contain a fully-fledged analysis of the impact of the block exemption and this should be the basis for subsequent decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: State aid for the German timber­processing industry</span></p>
<p class="contents">What action has the Commission taken, or will it take, in view of the increasing amount of state aid Germany is granting to sawmills in what used to be East Germany? The mills in question are small or medium-sized businesses which are very efficient and thus require so few employees that they meet the EU criteria for the allocation of state aid to SMEs, yet this means they are able to compete on unequal conditions and distort competition on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider it right that German sawmills which are highly automated and particularly efficient should be granted such huge amounts of state aid that other market operators are forced out of the market owing to unfair competition? Will it also say whether it still considers the existing rules on the allocation of state aid to SMEs to be adequate, in particular the 250-employee ceiling? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it is possible that the aid in question is compatible with the German systems and the Treaties, the Commission is very concerned by the distortion that it causes through the concentration of growing levels of production capacity in this particular industrial sector. As regards the acceptability of this aid, the Commission is carrying out a particularly detailed study of the compatibility with the common market of a series of aid measures for numerous businesses, in particular KNT, Klenk e Pollmeier. </p>
<p class="contents">It must be pointed out that this new capacity is to be found in areas that are assisted pursuant to Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty, that is to say, in regions where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is a serious underemployment problem. The assessment of the compatibility of all the aid granted has not yet finished, due to the information being incomplete. The investigation addresses in particular, the issue of respecting the criteria laid down by the relevant regional systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission has adopted initiatives with the intention of clarifying whether the beneficiaries are complying with all the criteria concerning the definition of small and medium-sized businesses, set out in its recommendation of 1996. In particular, I would like to stress the importance of ensuring that there is no evasion of the regulations. Businesses which formally respect the criteria for the definition of small and medium-sized businesses – particularly because they have less than 250 employees – but are in fact controlled by a large business, or by a group of large businesses, should not benefit from special incentives intended for small and medium-sized businesses. Finally, as regards the question of the adequacy of the current rules<span class="bold"> </span>on the authorisation of state aid for small and medium-sized businesses, an overall study of the subject would be needed. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the specific characteristics of the forestry sector, the Commission recently issued a communication on the competitiveness of forestry product industries and related industries in the European Union. This document, issued in October of this year, states that among other things, with the aim of ensuring the overall, sustainable competitiveness of the European Union forestry industry or related industries, it will be necessary to guarantee an environment that promotes fair competition and to encourage European Union industry to adapt to fiercer competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
