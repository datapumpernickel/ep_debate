<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bautista Ojeda (Verts/ALE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (ES) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for adopting this report by unanimity. In addition, I should like to recall Parliament’s considerable institutional support to the nuts and locust beans sector. This is evidenced in a number of resolutions testifying to the significance of this sector within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July 2001, Commissioner Fischler announced that a detailed study of the Community nuts sector would be undertaken. The Commissioner also stated that if appropriate, specific proposals to benefit the sector would be made, to follow on from the improvement plans expiring in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this situation, the Commission has proposed an additional one-year extension of the improvement plans. I have certainly welcomed this. Nonetheless, I would like to make it clear that I trust it will be the last transitional instrument, to be followed by a permanent proposal. Such a proposal must ensure the survival of the sector and put an end to the difficulties and uncertainty European Union producers are experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of our report was to settle the issue of permanent support measures once and for all. The nuts sector is very important to the Union from a social, economic and environmental point of view. Over a million hectares are devoted to these crops. They extend across the Mediterranean countries, and the land is mostly located in very disadvantaged areas where agriculture is difficult. Much of the soil is hillside or arid.</p>
<p class="contents">These products therefore have to overcome many difficulties to remain on the market and be economically viable without direct support from public institutions. The difficulties are exacerbated by strong outside competition. For instance, there are hazelnuts from Turkey and almonds from the United States. In both cases the conditions of production bear no comparison to those in Europe. In addition, the outside products benefit from tariff concessions under international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The nuts sector is an example of multifunctional production and is essential to the socio-economic survival of many families in rural areas of the Union. This is because of its role in regional planning, since no alternative crops exist, and also because of its part in environmental conservation. It helps prevent erosion and is important in combating fires. It also preserves indigenous genetic material, which is of great organolectic value.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this difficult situation and lack of competitiveness in 1989, the Commission adopted a package of specific measures. These were aimed mainly at raising the quality and competitiveness of the products. The ten-year improvement plans were due to expire in 2000 but were extended until 15 July 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the plans proved positive. There were notable improvements in production and marketing. Unfortunately the same was not true of competitiveness, due to the difficult structural conditions at the outset. The Commission’s present proposal would allow these last plans to be extended to 15 June 2002 with the Community contribution decreasing from 82 to 75%.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the specific case of hazelnuts, the payment per kilo is retained for the 2001-2002 harvest. Payments will only be made, however, to members of producer organisations not eligible for the extension. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has attempted to introduce considerable improvements to the executive committee’s proposal through its amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the restrictions on support for hazelnut production, we believe that it is not acceptable to withhold it from those producer organisations wishing to benefit from the extension of improvement schemes. This would amount to discrimination between producers’ organisations, giving some of them an unfair advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the level of national cofinancing, the increase on the current commitment proposed for the extended plans cannot be justified. In this connection, the percentage relating to nuts is minimal and does not justify the proposal. As for the areas covered by the plans and entitled to aid, the percentage should be retained on the basis of the area certified in the last year’s plans and not the area for which aid has been requested.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture is of the opinion that in order to improve awareness and production monitoring, provision must be made to set up a geographical information system. The committee is also on record as advocating the need to establish a permanent framework for aid to the sector. Further, the committee has argued for ongoing support in the form of aid per hectare to guarantee maintenance of the producers’ income in a situation of sustainable exploitation. Hence the advisability of linking this latest extension to permanent aid, the ultimate aim being to consolidate a system of ongoing aid channelled through the producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I must not conclude without mentioning the Committee on Agriculture’s specific request that chestnuts be included in the nuts sector. The protection of this tree and fruit associated with forested areas and ancient culinary traditions is crucial to preserving a very important ecosystem that is obviously being encroached upon. It also has a bearing on the related environmental issues. Finally, I should like to point out that two identical amendments have been put to plenary. They both aim at increasing support to hazelnuts by means of an additional marketing season.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable to support these amendments although I appreciate and share concerns over the difficulties currently experienced in marketing hazelnuts. The request for a permanent regime implies that support to hazelnuts would be covered by that regime. It is therefore not appropriate to extend still further a temporary arrangement with a set expiry date that has merely generated uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I trust we shall be able to continue enjoying the best desserts, the best nougat, and all those products manufactured with the best and most delicious hazelnuts and almonds in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should also be thanked for its almost unanimous support for this sector. The rapporteur has already described the importance of the fruit and vegetable sector for the countries of southern Europe, so there is no need for me to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost two years ago, the Council requested the Commission to undertake a specific assessment of the situation of the nuts sector in the framework of the report on the operation of the COM in fruit and vegetables. This problem has yet to be finally resolved. We are still trying to provide a remedy in extending the improvement plans. What is actually required is a final and immediately applicable definition, along with the implementation of support mechanisms to replace the present improvement programmes as they expire.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is adamant on resolving the extensions through this draft Regulation. A reduction in Community cofinancing is involved, however. In addition, aid to hazelnuts is proposed, but only for farmers not eligible for the extension.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s proposal to extend the improvement plans for a second year is positive. Nonetheless, it does not allay all of the producers’ concerns. As I stated, the latter are calling for a permanent solution, so they can continue to resist the strong competition by almonds from the United States and hazelnuts from Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deals with the gaps in the Commission’s plan. The amendments adopted call for specific aid to hazelnuts for all organisations requesting it, not just for those participating in improvement plans, as the Commission suggests. The amendments also call for the retention of current cofinancing levels for these improvement plans, whereas the Commission wishes to increase the Member States’ cofinancing from 18 to 25%. The deletion of a reference to gradual transferral of financial responsibility to the producers in recital 2 is also requested. Finally, there is the call to introduce a permanent regime based on the award of aid per hectare, subject to the implementation of good agricultural and environmentally friendly practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, these are the main requests from the Committee on Agriculture. The Committee also calls for this aid to be extended to chestnuts, a product not currently covered by the improvement plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The key factor is that the European Parliament is in favour of a permanent solution for this sector in the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables. Parliament calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal for the implementation of a definitive support regime for the sector before 1 June 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts to find a solution to the situation of the nuts sector in the European Union within the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables must therefore be intensified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will be aware, Commissioner, that on numerous occasions the European Parliament has expressed its institutional support for the nuts sector in the European Union. It has done so conscious of the fact that they are essentially a multifunctional crop which contributes to environmental conservation and helps combat erosion. It also has a part to play in regional planning, as it is one of the few activities keeping people on the land in places where other forms of agriculture are not viable. As most of the producer regions in the European Union are disadvantaged, it has economic and social significance too.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not in a position to oppose the Commission’s proposal to extend these plans for improving aid to the sector. We certainly support the rapporteur’s view that it is not acceptable for the Commission to propose excluding producer organisations wishing to benefit from the improvement plans from eligibility for the specific hazelnut aid. We cannot either go along with the Commission’s intention of reducing Community cofinancing from 82 to 75% in these extended plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are bound to say that we would like our request for permanent support to this sector to go on record. Such a solution would provide stability and make it possible to produce the crop in Europe. This can only happen if we succeed in setting up permanent support targeted at producer organisations and within a stable framework, namely the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should pursue this objective and approach during the extra year for which the plans will be extended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I am grateful to him for showing such sensitivity to the needs of the sector. The latter is obviously very important in Catalonia. I would also like to thank Mr Bautista Ojeda for being so receptive to the suggestions made by the Catalan regional government.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worth recalling that clearly we are not dealing with one of the major agricultural or livestock sectors central to the common agricultural policy (CAP). Nonetheless, this sector extends over a million hectares and makes a specific and significant contribution in the immediate vicinity. It has considerable social impact too.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view therefore, the request for maintaining support during 2001 and 2002 must lead, as previous speakers stated, to a permanent support regime per hectare. Consequently we are against Amendment No 10 tabled by Mr Fiori, because requesting support for 2002 and 2003 at this stage would essentially invalidate the report’s main objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that as outlined previously and in terms of hectare as in Mrs Ayuso’s amendment adopted in committee, namely certified areas, this report presents an approach the Commission should certainly consider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure he knows he can rely on total support from my group.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be hard to name an issue preceded by more Parliamentary initiatives during the last twelve years. The House has witnessed the same debate time and again during this period. The principles are unchanged, but the situation on the ground has worsened. Turkish economic policy recently caused an artificial fall in the price of hazelnuts and other agricultural products in response to internal pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new problem, but it escalated because the Commission failed to tackle it in its proposals. I do not believe the Commission’s suggestion, namely transferring the nuts problem to rural development, is realistic. This might have been said in the Committee on Agriculture. A problem related to the market should be dealt with using the appropriate tools. It is unwise to keep resorting to the second pillar to solve all our difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">For the last twelve years, the House has been advocating an honourable solution for this sector of production which is experiencing very specific problems. The Commission’s response has been simply to grant extensions to a regime that does not deal with the problems the sector needs to overcome. The permanent solution put forward by the House on a number of occasions has been ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">One might well wonder whether sometimes the nub of the problem is not in fact the Commission’s lack of resolve when it comes to proposing effective measures to deal with the difficulties facing the nuts sector, rather than the difficulties themselves. For my part, Commissioner, I hope that is not so on this occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by thanking you for your report, Mr Bautista Ojeda, and for all the time and trouble which you have taken in working out the 16 proposed amendments. Before I comment on these proposed amendments, I should like to say a few words about the proposal itself. As you probably know, improvement plans have been implemented for some 600 000 hectares sown with nuts since 1989. The European Union spent a total of EUR 900 million on these plans up to 2001. The purpose of the improvement plans was to enhance the economic basis for nut growing by pooling supplies, improving quality and building up a production and marketing infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">These plans were limited to ten years, after which financial responsibility would revert solely to producers. However, when the first plans ran out, a one-off extension was granted in Council Regulation No 558/2001. The eleventh year of these plans ran out last year, as did the 10-year deadline for a further series of plans and the plans for the remaining 35% of land sown with nuts will run out by 2006/2007.</p>
<p class="contents">On 23 July last year, the Council asked the Commission to launch an in-depth study into all aspects of this sector and called on it to submit the conclusions of the study and any proposals as quickly as possible. The study is well under way and will be presented in May of this year. The Commission was conscious of the fact that something needed to be done in the meantime and that this interim period needed to be bridged, which is why it suggested that the Council and Parliament approve the proposal for a regulation extending the improvement plans by a further year. This draft also makes provision for special aid for hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the 16 proposed amendments. The first group of amendments deals with general issues. Amendment No 1 refers to Regulation No 1035/1972, the proposed amendment to the Commission report to the Council on the common organisation of the market. Of course we can no longer change the wording of a regulation which has been abolished, but Amendment No 2 is acceptable in principle. I also agree with Amendment No 3 highlighting the ecological importance of the nut sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The second group of proposed amendments contains proposals for fundamental changes to the existing proposal. All these proposals impact on the budget, some considerably, which is why the Commission cannot agree to them. This applies to Amendments Nos 4 to 6, 10 to 12 and 15 and 16. The third group relates to the future of the sector. Amendments Nos 9 and 13 highlight the need for a permanent support regime for nuts, while Amendment No 8 calls for the benefits achieved with the improvement plans to be preserved, mainly by channelling supplies through producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 7 and 14 call for knowledge on production and control to be improved using the Geographical Information System. All these proposed amendments have repercussions which go beyond the framework of the proposal submitted, which merely recommends a year's extension, which is why I cannot accept these amendments within the context of this proposal. However, I can assure you that we have taken good note of your proposals and shall take proper account of them.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already explained on previous occasions, we are all agreed that there is a chronic lack of competition in this sector and that it does not therefore make economic sense to hang on to the belief that EU producers can hold out against free competition with Turkish hazelnuts or American almonds in the long term. In my opinion, therefore, we need an answer to the following questions. First, does the European Union need to produce its own nuts? Secondly, do nuts fulfil a multifunctional role? Thirdly, should the EU continue to invest in maintaining nut production? And fourthly, if so, in what form?</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that support measures should also help to promote the sustainability of rural areas and protect the environment and should not just be geared to making the sector economically competitive. Finally, I should like to thank you once again for your contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
