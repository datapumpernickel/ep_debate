<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="italic"> (IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, it is both a great honour and a great responsibility for the Italian Presidency to take the floor before the European Parliament on the issue of the International Criminal Court. It is certainly an honour since Italy has, from the very beginning, been among the Court's major supporters and has given its name to the Rome Statute. It is, at the same time, however, a great responsibility for the Italian Presidency to continue to support, with the same determination as our predecessors, the efforts of the international community to give life to an international jurisdiction that puts an end to impunity for those guilty of committing the most heinous crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court is proving to be a great success: to date, 90 countries have joined the Rome Statute. The Court held its inaugural session this year and, with the election of its President, judges, Prosecutor and Registrar, has become a fully functioning element in international relations. The European Union can be proud of having made a decisive contribution to these developments. The Italian Presidency has an important heritage to defend, and it intends to defend it. Only a few days ago, on 16 June, the Council confirmed its commitment to the Court through the adoption of a common position that has the political significance of confirming the European Union's unconditional support for the institution. On the basis of the common position, the May 2002 Action Plan will be updated. Action in support of the Court will remain an essential component of the Union's foreign policy measures. As you all know, in the pursuit of this action, the European Union will find itself facing some sensitive and complex issues, but this will certainly not lessen our commitment in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Our initiative will take various forms. Firstly, Italy will represent the European Union at the Second Assembly of States Parties in September. We are diligently preparing for this engagement and we will do everything in our power to resolve all the issues which are still outstanding with regard to the institution and the way it functions. Secondly, to ensure the Court’s efficient functioning and guarantee its independence, the European Union will continue to encourage the States to transfer swiftly and fully their contributions, determined according to the decisions made by the Assembly, and to respect the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court. Thirdly, the European Union will continue to urge those States that have not yet done so, to become party to the Statute, because we believe that the broadest possible participation is both desirable and necessary. In accordance with the provisions of the common position, a large-scale awareness campaign has already been launched in this regard, particularly in the context of political dialogue with non-Member States. Fourthly, the European Union will continue to uphold the integrity of the Rome Statute, including in our relations with our friend, the United States of America. As you can imagine, this is a frequent item on the agenda in transatlantic discussions and it was raised just last week at the European Union/United States Summit in Washington. Ladies and gentlemen, our aim is to pursue broad dialogue on all aspects of the issue with the United States. We and the United States share the same fundamental values and place the same importance – great importance – on the objective of putting an end to impunity for the most serious crimes and identifying the people responsible for committing them. However, objectively speaking, we have to admit that our views differ on what the Court’s role should be. The United States, with its massive presence on a global scale, is concerned about the possibility of politically-motivated accusations against its citizens. The European Union believes that the Court’s Statute provides sufficient guarantees of impartiality and authoritativeness, such as the high calibre of the judges and the principle of complementarity of the Court’s work, to lessen, or even allay the fears of possible exploitation of the institution’s activities. My predecessors have updated Parliament on developments in these ongoing discussions between the European Union and the United States of America and on the initiatives developed by both parties. I will not repeat what everyone already knows, but I would like to point out how, as far as Italy is concerned, we intend to proceed during this Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States fears, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, that the Court could constitute a threat, albeit an indirect one, to the conduct and implementation of United Nations’ peacekeeping operations. The European Union considers that the Court is an important safeguard for the protection of peace forces too. In this context, the UN Security Council has examined the United States’ proposals to exclude peace forces from the Court’s jurisdiction for two consecutive years. The European Union was able to express its firm support for the Court during Security Council meetings open to non-Member States in both years. This year, the Union also publicly came out in favour of convening the Security Council meeting which took place on 12 June. During this meeting, all the members of the Security Council were asked to strive to find a solution which would preserve both the integrity of the Rome Statute and the smooth operation of peace missions: two factors which are clearly not incompatible.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, as you know, is seeking to conclude a series of bilateral agreements to exempt its citizens from the Court’s jurisdiction. We heard yesterday that US military assistance has been withdrawn from some countries, including five which are about to join the European Union, which have declared that they are not amenable to such agreements. The Union regrets this measure. We do, of course, intend to analyse the matter in depth with a view to further talks with Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that, last September, the Council adopted Conclusions with certain guidelines to follow in concluding exemption agreements in order to preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute. The conclusions and guidelines were first and foremost intended for Member States and candidate countries, but they are clearly relevant to all States Parties to the Rome Statute. These documents have been disseminated in a large number of non-Member States with the intention of informing them of the basic position that the European Union has already taken over this issue. The European Union is firmly convinced that the International Criminal Court will make the world a safer place, or rather, it will help make the world a safer, fairer and more peaceful place. The simple fact of establishing the Court in practice will be a deterrent to committing the most serious crimes. By putting an end to impunity, the Court will strengthen the supremacy of the law and make a fundamental contribution to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Court will very soon prove to be a genuinely independent, effective institution. It will do so by working on actual cases and those who distrust it will be able to see – I repeat, from the Court’s actual work – that the Rome Statute guarantees the highest criteria of justice and does not lend itself – or, at least, we must endeavour to ensure that it never lends itself – to political manipulation. This will, of course, be one of our tasks in the frank, friendly dialogue between the Presidency and the United States of America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr Moreno Campo, recently appointed Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said when he was sworn in, ‘An International Criminal Court that is totally independent and impartial brings hope, but at the same time raises reasonable fears and misunderstandings’.</p>
<p class="contents">This Court brings the hope of a new era for international justice; it provides an effective tool for fighting impunity, and is therefore a deterrent factor – as the President of the Council has just said – to those who are tempted to carry out serious criminal acts that the Court has the authority to try. But it also, if we look at the position of the United States, raises fears and misunderstandings. It is the Americans’ fear of their people being pursued for political reasons which has led them to make efforts all over the world to obtain bilateral immunity agreements for their nationals, and which also led to the renewal of Security Council Resolution 1422.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to secure these agreements, the United States have not hesitated to use the threat of refusing to give military help to countries that do not sign them. What does this position mean? As they did not sign up to the Rome Statute, the United States consider themselves free to conclude immunity agreements, particularly in view of the considerable number of American soldiers deployed in the four corners of the globe. Whatever the value of this argument, there is no doubt that the significant contribution from the United States to peacekeeping cannot be ignored. It is also clear that countries that have signed the Rome Statute cannot use some sort of hidden door to escape their obligations to the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The guiding principles, adopted by the Union in September 2002, and to which the Presidency of the Council referred, are a little clearer on this point: we do not think that these agreements are necessary, but we accept them as long as they satisfy certain well-defined criteria. The agreements that the United States are trying to make do not match our conditions and are clearly aiming to undermine the Rome Statute insofar as they do not have any clear provisions to prevent impunity and they understand impunity as applying to those other than American nationals in a country for certain military or strictly administrative reasons. So how can we put forward our position?</p>
<p class="contents">We did this with the common position on 16 June, which unambiguously indicates that the guiding principles are not just some sort of internal scheming, but must be applied to justify the protection of the integrity of the Rome Statute in our relations with third countries. This position was the result of reasoning and dialogue. My colleagues Mr Patten and Mr Verheugen have joined forces with the Greek Presidency in sending joint letters to the Foreign Ministers of Member States, candidate countries and the Balkan States. They stress the need to take into account the Union’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">We have given instructions to our heads of delegation in third countries to stress the importance of this issue. In countries that have already signed an immunity agreement, our heads of delegation have been invited to look more closely at the probability of ratifying those agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">These diplomatic efforts are backed up by the considerable support that we have given to the NGOs campaigning for an effective International Criminal Court through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. Also, very recently, the Thessaloniki European Council confirmed that the Union unreservedly supports the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the results? Having recalled our principles and the action we are taking, let us have a clear view of this. The results are rather mixed. Even leaving aside the agreement signed hastily by Romania in August 2002, and even though the Member States and candidate countries resisted American pressure in order to come into line with the Union’s position of 16 June, it is clear that the situation in the Balkans remains vague: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and very recently the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia signed such agreements, none of which comply with the conditions defined in the Union’s guiding principles. We have not concealed our disappointment and we have expressed it to those countries. Regarding the renewal of Security Council Resolution 1422, there is no doubt in our minds that the legality of this measure is, at best, questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">We allowed an open debate in the Security Council where the concerns as to the legality of this proposition could be expressed. In a remarkable speech, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, not only raised doubts about whether the Security Council Resolution should be based on Article 16 of the Rome Statute but he also questioned the need for it. In fact United Nations peacekeeping forces remain under the jurisdiction of the State of which they are nationals and they would be immediately repatriated if they had committed a serious crime. As long as their country of origin dealt with the matter correctly, the additional jurisdiction of the Criminal Court would not enter into play.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on behalf of the Union, the Greek Presidency unequivocally stated that there was no question of accepting automatic renewal of this resolution in the years to come, allowing this conduct – because that is what it is – to continue unchallenged.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the considerable aid provided by the Union since 1995 for the International Criminal Court through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, in the shape of EUR 13 million, which is a significant sum, along with our efforts to raise awareness among parliamentarians, civil servants, civil society, those working in the legal system and even military personnel, for example, in the new independent States. Hand in hand with this goes our work in training defence lawyers in order to make this Court a tangible and immediate reality. Thinking also about what form our support will take in the next few years, we are listening to NGOs and several MEPs who will speak at a seminar organised by the Commission on 14 July to hear various points of view on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that I have defended and presented a position that is entirely in line with what the Presidency of the Council has just said. No one will be surprised at this. There is no doubt that the International Criminal Court presents a challenge in terms of transatlantic relations. When the eminent team made up of 18 judges and prosecutors begins its work, we are convinced, as Europeans, that the International Criminal Court will prove worthy of our support and confidence. It will also dispel the concerns that remain here and in the minds of our American friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament's full support for both your positions is apparent from the resolution that we have adopted. Contrary to what we thought in the past, economic order and the internal market are not the most important components in the European Union. The crux of the matter – which we discovered very clearly during the enlargement process – is the fact that we are a legal community, one that is committed to the rule of law and to an international legal order. These are the elements that make up the heart of the European Union and determine its character. This is why it goes without saying that the three major institutions within the European Union should stand united behind this same line.</p>
<p class="contents">You sometimes hear that recourse to the law is a sign of weakness. Europe is weak in a military sense, and this is why it is said that we pay particular attention to such things as the international legal order. The Americans are strong in military terms, which is why they can manage without this concern for the international legal order and can rely on power politics. This is an extremely cynical view, although there has obviously been cause in the past to think along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the International Criminal Court's predecessor, the Tribunal for Yugoslavia, was set up at the time because those who then felt responsible, or behaved as if they were responsible, for the war in Yugoslavia and its ending, looked for a way to delay military intervention. This is when we got this Tribunal for Yugoslavia. Fortunately, the International Criminal Court, which is the present institution, has not been a mere palliative for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will, of course, need to be convinced in other areas that it does not lack in the ostentatious display of power. After all, the implementation of law always needs to be backed up by power, and this also applies to the Americans. Power is exerted in order to administer law. In fact, we can also refer to the American Constitution in this respect, which considers international legal order, rule of law and democracy to form part of their national interest. This is a very fine definition of national interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The present threats to third countries with a view to having these countries sign bilateral inviolability agreements are, of course, a serious matter. The new accession countries are, at the same time, new NATO members; it is to be seen how serious the Americans still take the existence of NATO if military assistance is simply withdrawn. Moreover, the ICC provides only supplementary jurisdiction, whereby it is assumed that the countries that have signed the agreement are themselves constitutional states and most definitely call those to account who have possibly misbehaved in the course of their military duty.</p>
<p class="contents">In some Member States, we do indulge from time to time in some antics that stir up distrust on the part of the Americans. This is illustrated by the strange fact that General Franks was denounced by Belgium as a war criminal. If legislation is used in this manner, it is made political, as the minister stated a moment ago, and this leads to distrust of the law. It is, therefore, vitally important, in my view, that the EU Member States should be well aware of how they need to behave in this connection so as not to stir up any distrust among the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, the case – we have to give this to the Americans – that the US runs a greater risk than we do, particularly on account of the large-scale activities in the military sphere. Despite this, I think that, especially given this understanding, a dialogue with the US must be a priority. There may be room for some humour in this. The law about a possible invasion of The Hague, for example, is obviously something that we cannot possibly take seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say how shocked I am as a parliamentarian by the methods that are being used to put pressure on certain countries – and I am thinking in particular of the pressure that Colombia is under, threatened with the suspension of American aid for combating drug traffickers, and the pressure put on the Baltic countries or other NATO candidate countries – but also the extent to which the whole of Europe is currently dependent on the European Union; and there is a very particular symbolic significance in all of us, the Council, Parliament and the Commission being in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely essential that the Italian Presidency should be aware that this International Criminal Court is more than an instrument for fighting the Americans and their unilateralism; it is a way of us ensuring that we restore European coherence in both international policy and international law. We will therefore watch very closely what happens in the Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will prosecute the worst kind of crimes, such as genocide, mass slaughter, widespread rape and ethnic cleansing. It will help make the world a safer place. The European Union must live up to its leadership in establishing the Court by ensuring that all Member States fulfil their funding and legal obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States' opposition to the Court is totally irrational. There are ample checks and safeguards to prevent politically motivated prosecutions. It is absurd to claim that US peacekeepers would run the gauntlet of anti-American prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">US domestic political ideology is in conflict with American security interests. Surely an international court which signals that the international community will not allow gross breaches of law to go unpunished coincides with the objectives of the United States global security doctrine.</p>
<p class="contents">We may not be able to stop the US from shooting itself in the foot, but we ought to be able to stop it shooting the rest of us in the foot. It is deploying the most outrageous bullying tactics to get small countries to sign bilateral immunity agreements. Six of the seven EU accession states which are candidates to NATO have not obtained a waiver and have had military aid cut off.</p>
<p class="contents">It is alarming to see the Bush Administration pursuing its anti-ICC campaign to such lengths as to cut off military assistance to its allies in the war against terrorism. Indeed, most ICC member states are democracies with relatively strong commitment to the rule of law, so the aid cut-offs represent a sanction targeting states that abide by democratic values. That is extremely perverse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Balkan states are in a very vulnerable position. Croatia and Bulgaria have refused to sign. Romania, Albania and Bosnia have granted immunity and Macedonia, too, I understand. It is no good just saying we regret that they do not live up to EU criteria. We have to both sanction and protect these accession and aspirant states. This is the kind of exercise which, if the EU cannot hang together, with its candidate and aspirant states, makes people despair of a common foreign and security policy. We should be able to do more and I hope we will be able to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the struggle between sovereignty and law regarding the new world order the United States has in this way chosen ever more obviously to maximise its own sovereignty at the expense of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">As our ultimate purpose is to safeguard the rule of law and take a stand against war crimes and other international crimes going unpunished, it is more important than ever that we should strengthen cooperation amongst ourselves to bring about universal administration of justice, so that those guilty of these serious crimes are made to answer for their deeds properly and without exception. That means supporting the ICC in every way possible and getting rid of the giant loopholes that still exist in judicial practice, for example by increasing EU Member States’ legislative capacity for dealing with international crimes.</p>

<p class="contents">A former Nuremberg prosecutor, Benjamin B. Ferencz, said: 'There can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, no meaningful law without a Court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstance.' The International Criminal Court affords us the opportunity to ensure that not only captured prisoners or the lowest of the service people involved in conflicts, but also generals and heads of state can be brought to justice for genocide and for crimes against humanity. It is unfortunate that, while so many positive things happened in the latter half of the twentieth century, words such as 'ethnic cleansing' and 'genocide' have come into our normal vocabulary. We must have a proper mechanism in place to ensure that, if a national court is not able or willing to bring a case against somebody who is accused of crimes against humanity, then there must be an international forum to do so. That is why we ascribe and subscribe to the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would hate it if people – especially the people in the gallery watching us today – went away from this Chamber thinking that this is merely an opportunity for the European Union to bash America. America is wrong in its stance with regard to the International Criminal Court. However, it is entitled to take that stance; it is entitled to put forward its own viewpoint and its own ideas; it is entitled to make new agreements with third countries, if it so wishes. However, those countries will have to deal with the consequences of those negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we can give leadership, as we already have done, and the best way to do so is by example, not merely by criticising people who do not agree with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The court deserves support from every state in the world, without exception. People who commit serious war crimes, including rape, must not be able to avoid being brought to justice. The EU wholeheartedly supports the court and gives it its full backing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incomprehensible how a democratic country such as the United States can ask for its not to be possible for those of its citizens who are complicit in this type of crime to be held accountable for serious war crimes. If the United States itself were to take legal proceedings against such criminals, that would be in accordance with the International Criminal Court’s charter, and the court would then have no reason to prosecute American citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States’s action cannot but give the impression, however, that the United States has no intention of taking legal proceedings against its citizens if they are guilty of serious war crimes. That would be devastating, especially for the United States as a community founded on the rule of law. It is, of course, also unacceptable for the United States to blackmail other countries with a view to undermining the International Criminal Court. The United States’s threat to withdraw military or economic aid if a bilateral agreement on impunity is not signed is dictatorial language that must not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I assume that the Commission and the Council will vigorously oppose this conduct and press for the United States to accept the International Criminal Court as an important legal instrument for combating serious war crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That this news does not surprise us does not mean that we do not regret it and even – as the Presidency of the Council said just now – condemn it. However, we are also pleased to see that many countries have been able to resist the pressure that they have been under. I think that the courage shown by those countries in working towards the success of the agreement on the International Criminal Court deserves both our respect and our admiration.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish by saying that once again, the pressure that those countries are under is all the more inappropriate, all the more incomprehensible, inappropriate because it is incomprehensible, given that the Statute of the Court provides a means to respond to the American concerns, which, in certain respects, we can understand just as many of you do.
