<p class="contents">Over the past five years the Commission and Parliament have together followed a path in which Parliament’s constructive contribution and cooperation, often in very difficult circumstances and with very tight deadlines, will certainly be one of the defining characteristics of this legislature. Recent Eurobarometer surveys, carried out for the Commission, have shown a general desire on the part of the citizens for more Europe. Those expectations are greater still against the backdrop of an enlarged Europe of 455 million inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s new citizens, in common with those of the rest of the EU, want to live freely in a safe and secure world. Security is not only a matter of combating crime, it is also a means of ensuring freedom. These two concepts are inextricably linked and the Commission has always sought to strike a balance between freedom and security. The third element of this area is, of course, justice, which helps to protect freedom and to guarantee security in an area in which mobility and relationships between people and companies across national borders is increasingly common.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, many EU citizens still fear enlargement’s potential impact on security. It is important that we address those fears rationally. The process of enlargement has made it possible to strengthen the new Member States’ ability to contribute towards developing stability and security throughout the European Union, not only because they have access to the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> but also because of the improvements in the police and the judiciary that the Commission has supported during these last five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations with the accession countries were only concluded when it was decided by mutual agreement that a satisfactory level of compliance with the existing legislative framework and sufficient ability to implement and enforce that framework had been achieved by the new Member States. It transpires that all of these countries need to make further progress. The Commission will carry out its usual role of guardian of the Treaties and will continue to offer significant financial assistance as a follow-up to the PHARE projects, which will continue until 2006, and, subsequently, by means of a Schengen mechanism and transitional arrangements. No less importantly, it must be made clear that all Member States are welcome to enjoy the possibilities of European Union funding under general Justice and Home Affairs programmes, on a completely equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">A further aspect that has been brought to the fore by the media concerns the fear of a massive movement of new citizens across Europe. As I have had the opportunity to state here, such fears are unjustified. The Commission has carried out a study showing that over the next five years, around 1% of the total working population of the new Member States will exercise the right to move freely, which amounts to 220 000 people per year, in an EU of over 450 million inhabitants. I should like to mention, based on my own personal experience, that, on the eve of Spain and Portugal joining the EU, similar fears were raised, which turned out to be completely unfounded. The Accession Treaty provides for the possibility of the current Fifteen Member States implementing transitional measures. These measures are adequate and I trust that they will indeed be only transitional.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement represents a major challenge for certain policies, such as tightening external border controls. We hope that the External Borders Agency will be operational as of 1 January 2005 to support the efforts made by the ten new Member States to improve border controls. As Parliament is aware, internal border controls in the new Member States will only be removed following a process of a specific evaluation and a subsequent decision by the Council. This two-stage process can only be deemed complete once the Schengen Information System, known as ‘second generation’ SIS, has been established. The timetabled development of SIS-II therefore constitutes a priority for the Commission and will require the active involvement of all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of judicial cooperation, mutual trust becomes even more crucial in an enlarged Europe, to ensure that the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions applies across the board. Accordingly, we must improve certain measures contained in procedural law, such as those provided for in the framework decision on procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, which the Commission has just submitted to the Council. We must also enhance mutual trust between all EU Member States by improving knowledge of each other’s legislative and judicial systems. At Parliament’s request, the Commission is in the process of creating an exchange programme for judges from all Member States, in both civil and criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the policies of Justice and Home Affairs, we face a number of challenges. One of those is visa policy and, more specifically, the principle of reciprocity in this area, an issue to which the Commission has paid close attention. In an enlarged EU, so that the area of Justice and Home Affairs can operate, it is essential that the Constitutional Treaty enters into force, that it sets about dismantling the pillar structure and that the codecision process becomes more commonly used, which will guarantee full democratic responsibility for decisions taken in this area. Judicial control must be improved, extending the Court of Justice’s competence and granting the Commission powers commonly used in infringement cases. The draft Constitutional Treaty addresses these challenges, and proposes that qualified majority voting be introduced in the area of common immigration policy, asylum and external borders, and that the provisions be strengthened as regards integrating third country nationals residing legally in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of solidarity, which already applies today, will be more clearly laid down in the Constitutional text concerning border controls, asylum and immigration. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to recall, lastly, that 1 May is not only the date of the accession of the ten new Member States but also the deadline set in the Treaty of Amsterdam for completing the first stage of the phasing-in of the area of freedom, security and justice. The Commission will soon submit a communication in which it assesses the progress made in the past five years and which will include the first guidelines for future priorities. These priorities will be based on the shared values of freedom, security and justice in an enlarged Europe and must be based on the advances that we all hope will be provided for in the future Constitutional Treaty, which must be approved, and thus come fully into force, without delay.</p>

<p class="contents">Freedom, security and justice. In my view, these are areas in which the urgent need to confront the profound changes which are approaching in a Europe of 450 million citizens and which, unfortunately, as we can see, sometimes moves forward as a result of such tragic events as terrorist attacks and the regrettable deaths of the victims of immigration, has been demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the great challenge awaiting us is to organise a new geo-political and demographic space in a dynamic, changing and constantly growing Europe. I would therefore like to emphasise everything the Commissioner has just said on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked intensively over the last five years to enshrine the guarantees and protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens, and the results can be seen, such as the approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the steps aimed at approving common guarantees in criminal proceedings throughout the Union and the implementation of the European arrest warrant, a guarantor for one of our principle rights, which is the right of society to pursue relentlessly those who endanger the lives and security of the citizens. Without forgetting the protection of the victims of crime and particularly the victims of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In any process, however, such as the one with which we are currently occupied, we must not forget to look forward. To this end, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we must change anything that is not working. It is crucial that we modify the current decision-making method, with its cases of overlapping initiatives or delays resulting from the unanimity rules as well as flagrant delays in incorporating Community legislation into that of the Member States. We must also reinforce and make progress on the achievements already made. I would therefore like to insist on the proposal I made in the annual debate on the report on the area of freedom, security and justice, such as producing a Tampere II.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that the new European Constitution must enshrine the hope represented by the chapter aimed at the regulation of this new area, that is, we must bring the legal instruments into line with the reality of the dangers currently threatening the freedom and security of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me, Mr President, to thank your Presidency and the Commissioner for your invaluable contribution to the defence of the values and rights of a society such as ours which wishes to feel increasingly free within a new enlarged area, in which security and justice, in turn, also provide the guarantees for that freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said at the beginning of his contribution that it would be our last opportunity to hear him. I hope that is not true and that those Members who return to the new Parliament will again have the pleasure of working with him. I am sure colleagues will agree he has been one of the best and most accessible of all the Commissioners. He has worked closely with us in our committee on a very difficult dossier and very challenging topics.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is our joint challenge to enable everyone in the new wider Europe to live freely in a safer world, of which Europe is just one part. It sometimes seems that we are playing around with a jigsaw puzzle and do not even know what all the pieces are. We certainly do not know yet how they fit together.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hernández Mollar spoke of the deep-rooted challenges we face. In the work of our committee on citizens' rights and freedom, the challenge must be to ensure that despite deep-rooted changes we are still able to maintain the rights of over 400 million EU citizens to freedom of movement, a decent education and a decent home.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlarged Europe must not be an excuse for us to replace the Iron Curtain with a division between rich and poor people and rich and poor countries. Rights have to be equal wherever you live within this new Europe, whatever the colour of your skin, your ethnicity, your religion or whether you have no religion at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this afternoon there were some bigoted contributions from the other side of the Chamber about the dominance of Christianity in Europe and how important that was. I reject that. It has no place in these debates because people's rights should not be affected by religion, gender, origin or age. We must do everything we can to protect minorities and to give them freedom from oppression. This includes the rights, for example, of the Roma people in some of the Eastern European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner was right when he said that enlargement is a real challenge and it is not one that we have by any means addressed yet. We have the challenge of the external frontiers, to which he referred. In our efforts to control those frontiers and stop supplies of drugs and weapons, we must not make a barrier between our wealthier 25 countries and the poorer states just outside those new frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, Mr Vitorino, you share with us the desire to make certain that there is justice in this enlarged Europe. You spoke of companies and businesses. That must continue and include freedom of the press – not closing down newspapers, as we have seen in some countries. There is a right to free television, and free media, not those dominated by a few people with vested interests.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot for us to do. Commissioner, you have referred to many of the points this afternoon. I shall just mention a couple more. We must ensure that there is no oppression of those people who wish to move around, to exercise their right to free movement. You. have referred to the hysteria in some of the press about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to access asylum must be reinforced, because we in this Parliament and the Commission are guardians of those rights: the right to asylum for those in need. The Commission is one of the guardians of those Treaties and of those rights. We can look forward to the future with some optimism. If there is anyone listening who is in a position to look for a new President of the Commission, my suggestion – for what it is worth – would be you, Commissioner Vitorino. I hope that will be taken on board. We thank you for all you have done and I thank Mr Hernández Mollar and other colleagues on the committee for everything they have done over the last few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why the European Union is one of the most successful, most attractive ventures, as is demonstrated by the present enlargement, because the new Member States and those that will join in the future have chosen Europe largely because of these values. We are talking about freedom now, the four basic freedoms. Permit me, Mr President, Commissioner, to talk about one of the four basic freedoms now, namely the free movement of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few months in all the Member States and yesterday here, in this room, we have all been celebrating the enlargement. We could freely celebrate the enlargement; we had good reason to do so. Even so, a small shadow was cast over the celebration: the fact that only three of the existing Member States guarantee the free movement of workers, and only one of them – Sweden – does so without restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we Liberals oppose any restriction on the free movement of workers. Even a temporary restriction. We do so firstly on principle, and secondly for practical reasons. On principle, we are opposed to the fact that one of the basic rights is limited, and on principle, we feel that this limitation negatively affects the festive mindset as regards accession.</p>
<p class="contents">There are practical reasons for opposing it as well, and I fully agree with Mr Vitorino. The fears are exaggerated; every survey shows that the free movement of workers, or the demand for it, is not significant in scale. As far as Hungary is concerned, we are well aware that it will affect barely 2% of the workforce. Those affected will be well-trained young single people, 85% of whom want to find employment in other countries for just one or two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, something else is happening here. The European Union wants to become a region of growth and competitiveness, and the Lisbon Process aims to achieve this. This will be difficult to achieve unless a unified and flexible labour market is established. Without this, Europe will never achieve the targets for 2010 set out in the Lisbon Process.</p>
<p class="contents">If the workforce is not allowed to move to the production capacities, then the production capacities will move to the workforce. This connection must also be borne in mind. For this reason, at the end of my speech, please let me ask the Commission to make a statement similar to Mr Vitorino’s – in the form of a Commission Statement – for removing restrictions, and we call on the Member States to include this matter on the agenda of the next Council Meeting in June, and to take immediate steps to resolve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that we need greater security – as you have quite rightly said – in order to guarantee freedom, but that guarantee must not take the form currently employed by the United States Government, which identifies security with a reduction in freedom. If we want more Europe we must provide greater guarantees of democratic freedoms and not take the view that through greater security, with greater resources, only by reducing freedoms, will we guarantee that security. I would like to say that in order to combat terrorism we need intelligence at European level and coordination of police services at European level as well, elements which must be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, freedoms have been mentioned, and the European Parliament is the highest manifestation of the largest democratic concentration in the world, but I believe it is clear that the freedoms of the peoples, regions and nationalities existing within the European Union must also be guaranteed. And the European Union must clearly condemn the massacres which are being committed against the Chechen and Kurdish people and must guarantee the rights of Stateless peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The language, culture and identity of peoples and regions must have guarantees. In this Europe of ours, in certain States of the Union – specifically in our State – in the name of effectively combating terrorism, initiatives have been taken which are not entirely positive, which have allowed democratic newspapers to be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Valencian and as a representative of a people which forms part of the European Union, I believe that this Europe of security and freedom must take full account of the national freedoms of the peoples and regions that make up the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced the task that the new Member States are facing is to prove their ability to have a wider view. They must prove that they do not see European integration merely in terms of Structural Funds, the importance of which is often overestimated. They must prove that they do not perceive European integration in terms of their own problems. They must prove that they are able to understand and to take responsibility for the further development of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about security, we should bear in mind that our security is influenced by our immediate surroundings, by our neighbouring countries, by North African countries and by the Middle East. These are countries with millions of inhabitants who look toward the EU as their aim and where millions of potential illegal immigrants live. These people can easily fall under the influence of fundamentalist and extremist ideology and become themselves tools of terrorism, which is today the number one threat.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wants to ensure the security of its citizens it must, amongst other things, make its closest neighbours economically and politically stable by increasing their economic growth, reduce the possibility of migration and reduce the growth of radicalism in these societies. The European Union must use a new financial framework to re-evaluate its development aid policy, and must use adequate resources to ensure that those resources are used effectively. These are real issues and real problems that must be solved. I am very worried that the abstract intellectual exercises in compiling documents, such as the European Constitution, will not help us greatly in solving these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only because a 15-year old would have had difficulty in becoming a Member of the European Parliament, but also because at that time we did not see the slightest possibility of Hungary becoming a member of the secure and free region provided by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the twenty-first century, our freedom and our security have often been in irreconcilable conflict with each other. Everybody would like to avoid challenges that threaten the security of one’s nation, but nobody wants to damage our civil, political and social rights won during the eighteenth century and strengthened by many revolutions, including the 1848 and 1956 Hungarian revolutions. It is difficult to solve these conflicts, but I believe that the Members of the enlarged European Union, together with the citizens of Europe, will be able to find the answers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European area of security and the Schengen Agreement provide protection for us. At the same time, we must not forget that the borders of Europe are not the same as the borders of the European Union. In our efforts to make the Union safe, we must not ignore our solidarity with those nations whose representatives do not sit here with us at the moment. Europe, and within Europe, the European Union will only be able to become a great and strong community if its responsibility to ensure its safety goes hand in hand with its unquenchable desire for freedom as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to talk to you now about the Hungarians’ commitment to freedom, because you all know my people. I have often been asked what we Hungarians bring with us into the European Union. Among many other things, we bring our faith and our readiness to act for a Europe that is free, secure and based on solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He really has been a splendid Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs. I hope we will see more of him, not least because he would help us achieve in justice and home affairs the equivalent of the Lisbon objective to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world. Why do we not have a parallel formal objective, perhaps the Tampere objective, to make the enlarged European Union the international beacon of human rights, protection of civil liberties and keeping people safe?</p>
<p class="contents">In justice and home affairs there is not the same sense of zeal from ministers about promoting freedom as about promoting security. Security is an aspect of freedom because no-one who is unsafe is free, but freedom is also an element in security and no-one is secure if their privacy is invaded or they are wrongly imprisoned or subject to discrimination. But the Council has failed to speak out against Guantanamo Bay internment and is trying to impose an agreement with the US on air passenger data transfers in breach of European data protection laws. It has also allowed restrictions on freedom of movement, as my Hungarian colleague has said.</p>
<p class="contents">In the accession treaties there is a JHA safeguard clause, but it is focused exclusively on monitoring implementation of mutual recognition measures and framework decisions in criminal law. There is no clause which will check whether asylum seekers are being left destitute, equal rights are being denied to gay and lesbian people, or ethnic minority people are being abused. We must have a mechanism of ongoing peer review whereby we have mutual monitoring of the quality of Member States' justice systems.</p>
<p class="contents">On immigration we need much better management in the future. Member States have agreed most of the common asylum policy, but have lowered standards of protection to do so. Very little is agreed for streamlining the red tape for legal migrants and there is an alarming absence of progressive and active engagement in how to respect diversity and have imaginative integration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The ceremony of raising the ten new flags yesterday was wonderful and moving, but the image it presented was exclusively white. In my city, one-third of the population is from ethnic minorities. We have to do better to serve our whole population with just and inclusive policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the wake of September 11 much oppressive legislation has been forced through. This is a major problem because it seems that the rule of law is being pushed aside in the fight against terrorism. If you push the rule of law aside and ignore it you are in effect allowing the terrorists to win on another front.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we had to vote for the third time on what was basically the same issue. This is very alarming because it showed that there was much unwillingness within the Council to accept the democratic will of Parliament: it obviously hoped that if it asked us enough times it would get the answer it wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the PNR issue, it is extremely important that citizens have the right to data protection. We should have the same rights as US citizens if there is any agreement, that is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the issue of Christianity versus Islam there is a major problem. This is not acceptable. Europe has to allow all people to live freely within society, whether they are Muslim, Christian or of no religious belief. Everybody should be entitled to equal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of hypocrisy regarding people from the new Member States. All 15 of the 'old' Member States have introduced measures restricting the rights of the new countries' citizens coming in as regards whether they can get jobs, travel or benefit from social services in the 'old' Member States. This is creating double standards, which is a major problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of third country nationals, we have a major problem throughout the European Union with this 'Fortress Europe' mentality, keeping out the so-called non-desirables: non-whites, non-westerners or non-Christians. In all countries we have a major problem with more and more oppressive legislation being introduced. Even things like the Geneva Convention are being pushed aside in the interests of keeping people out of Europe. We have to take down the barriers. We have to allow Europe to be open and we must help these people. We have to look at why they are fleeing from their own countries. That is the way to look at peace, security and justice for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That will probably make many people happy and it might make some sad. It does not make me necessarily glad but, because of now leading the largest party in Northern Ireland, I have more duties at home and I feel I must attend to them, especially at this time when certain talks are taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">For the past 25 years I have been a Member of this House, elected at the top of the poll from Northern Ireland. I have been gratified to have the largest amount of votes cast for any person elected to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Its rapid growth of jurisdiction is the political mystery of the age. However, I do not believe it is to the best advantage of the European peoples. Enlargement has triggered the destruction of the cooperation of the sovereign states of Europe and brought about the construction of the sovereign superstate of Europe, the new Tower of Babel.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of the full battle between the voluntary cooperation of the European sovereign states and the dictatorial incorporation of those states into the European superstate have yet to be witnessed. In our history superpowers have always been detrimental to peace. The wars in the Balkans in recent years have been conveniently forgotten when fiery advocates of an almighty Europe tell us the new Europe has prevented and stopped wars. Some prevention, and some stopping.</p>
<p class="contents">The present enlargement is bringing with it loads of difficulties, generally in the economic field and particularly in the agricultural field. Just how serious the reaping in Europe is going to be remains to be seen. The day has yet to declare it.</p>
<p class="contents">I especially welcome the fact that the United Kingdom will have its referendum and that the ordinary European citizens in the United Kingdom will not be robbed of their right to pass their judgement on this momentous decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The continent of Europe is not our fatherland and never can be. The nationalities of Europe are not changed, they are the creation of God.

I believe that the Minutes will show that my colleague Mr Pirker has given up his two minutes so that I have four minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the eastern enlargement of our European Union on 1 May, to what are now 25 countries did not happen overnight, but was a ten-year-long process, which demanded an enormous amount both of the old European Union as well as of the new Member States. In the area of justice and home affairs, many citizens of the old EU Member States were afraid of a higher crime rate after enlargement. Here, however, the accession negotiations, as well as an enormous amount of cooperation on the part of the new Member States themselves, have enabled us to achieve a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Who would have thought, ten years ago, that one day German and Polish border guards would together control their borders in joint teams? The new Member States were also very successful in the area of combating national crime, and so the old Member States often had to abandon their prejudices. Faced with more and more further threats, specifically from international terrorism, we must, in the future, act even more as Europeans. After the attacks of 11 September in New York, we saw what was, unfortunately, a one-off advance in our common justice and home affairs policy, with a great deal decided on in record time: the European Arrest Warrant, a single definition of terrorism, which included a framework for penalties and the freezing of all funds for terrorist purposes. Unfortunately, after just a year, interest was already waning and we in this House did not even manage to strengthen the Europol structure for combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, nations went it alone, and national plotting came to the fore; only after the tragic Madrid bombings did the issue once again appear at the top of our agenda. In the Council, the position of Terrorism Coordinator was quickly created, unfortunately without any real powers. The measures that we adopted after 11 September 2001 – that is, almost two and a half years ago – have still not been implemented in the Member States. The upshot is that Parliament and the European Union have done our homework but the Member States have not and so the next important questions are already on the agenda for a now enlarged Union. Our visa policy must be harmonised and must include the creation of a visa information system. Border protection standards must be unified and controlled by a European border protection agency and the second generation Schengen Information System must finally be completed. Europol must be even more closely involved in the national fight against crime and be given more manpower, and we urgently need the European Public Prosecutor, in order to effectively combat the defrauding of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, the new Member States must take even more decisive action against corruption than has been the case to date. Cooperation with third countries must also be stepped up since terrorism must be combated, not just in Europe, but also across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, in this legislative period, achieved a number of things for the safety of European citizens. A great deal fell through, though, as a result of the need for unanimity in the Council and because of national egoisms. This is why there is hardly a content area for which the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty is so important as that of justice and home affairs policy. The EU of 25 Member States will in future only be in a position to effectively combat terrorism and organised crime if we implement simpler and more transparent procedures. The Council in particular must change over to majority voting. In addition, whilst this Treaty is in place, the budget should be significantly increased, since not just agriculture and economic structures, but also safety, cost money. To this end, I hope for constructive and specially focused cooperation in the newly elected Parliament. You deserve our thanks, Commissioner Vitorino. We did not always agree on asylum issues, but we always gave you great support where justice and home affairs policy was concerned and I hope it was this that brought forth applause from the Left, since that shows that in the future we will be in a position to act together and be stronger than we were before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question of freedom and security in the Europe of the twenty-five, which we are debating today, is directly linked, Commissioner, to the security of the Olympic Games being organised in Greece this summer. The holding of the Games under conditions of security has always been the only headache, even from ancient times, which is why the truce was the most serious part of the preparations, so that athletes and spectators could arrive at Olympia in safety. I believe, even if this sounds romantic, that the promotion of the idea of the truce in modern times and the education of people in peaceful coexistence would cost far less and would have more permanent results than strengthening the forces of suppression and the use of military means. For the Europe of the twenty-five, the 2004 Olympic Games are a golden opportunity to promote the idea of the truce at global level, by which I mean the ideals of peace, cooperation and dialogue and the rejection of violence as a means of resolving differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the reality of the modern world speaks of the intensification of blind violence, hatred and terrorism. The publication of photographs showing prisoners in Iraq being tortured and humiliated demonstrates the extent of the brutalisation and barbarity which involvement in wars and acts of violence can generate in man. At the same time, it demonstrates the degree of freedom of the press which we have achieved and must maintain.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, nearly three years since the attack on the twin towers, not only has terrorism not been eradicated, but it also appears to be creating conditions of brutalisation for those who belong to modern democracies and are supposed to be defended with fundamental freedoms and human rights. Will the political leaders realise that a different strategy for dealing with terrorism and strengthening security is needed? The European Union of the twenty-five needs to offer an alternative proposal, a new vision and to reply to the crucial question of whether there can be security on a planet with huge inequalities in economic and social development and in the distribution of the benefits of democracy, science and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">For the strengthening of security in the European Union, for a more secure world, we certainly need fresh, alternative, non-military policies and strategies and a stronger role for citizens, especially women. We hope that the new European Constitution will be approved soon and will constitute the democratic framework which will strengthen fundamental freedoms and security in Europe and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I too should like, Commissioner, to congratulate you on the exceptional work you are doing as Commissioner to promote the area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, an endeavour which has, unfortunately, proven to be far more difficult than the creation of the single market and the common currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is good about this is that no one can bully any other group.</p>
<p class="contents">The monitoring of minority rights was an important part of the negotiations on enlargement, yet there is no policy for linguistic minorities in the EU. We have demanded more of the present candidate countries than we did of previous ones. The situation in Cyprus following the referendum was also the most recent demonstration of the need we have for minimum rules governing the way in which ethnic and linguistic minorities are treated and governing the rights that must exist. It is therefore important that respect for diversity be a feature of the adopted Constitution and that the EU subscribe not only to the Council of Europe’s Convention on Human Rights but also to the Council of Europe’s conventions on minorities: both the framework convention and the Charter for Regional Languages.</p>
<p class="contents">In that way, the EU would quickly obtain a yardstick for policy in relation to minorities. It should be possible to deal with infringements of minority rights in accordance with Article 7 of our present Treaty, in which case a Member State’s own rights would be revoked if it infringed minority rights. It is now time for the EU to go the whole way and recognise linguistic diversity, as well as possessing a genuine strategy for respecting such diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not be making any particular reference to our national situation in Latvia, nor will I talk about minorities – there will be time for that on other occasions – but about Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom without security is not conceivable, as we have already heard, but the threats to freedom today are of quite a different nature to what they were in the recent past. If the threat to freedom previously came mainly from other countries, nowadays that is no longer the case in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union in itself is proof of this. The threat to freedom comes from within our country – violence is increasing, organised crime, terrorism and corruption are the most direct threats to freedom, to various human rights. For a long time now the criminal world has not recognised borders, so cooperation between various security bodies in the European Union, as well as beyond its borders, is especially important.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must do everything in its power to ensure this cooperation. The sense of menace to the individual is today no longer slight. We must not allow a situation where fear is the defining factor in people's thought and action, where we would be prepared to yield, to compromise with those who do not respect us, because of fear. In order to guarantee human freedoms, sacrifices must be borne. Only by certain curbs on freedom can security be achieved. If, in our discussions of how far freedom ought to be restricted for the sake of security, we keep our ideals in mind – and these discussions should never end – then we will be on the right path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The increasing diversity of cultures, languages and religions is undoubtedly one of those basic values. Human rights are universal and they must be extended to everyone without any discrimination on the grounds of sex, age, material status, ethnic origin, mother tongue or citizenship. The rights of national minorities are an inalienable component of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest, serious problems in this sphere remain in both the old and the new Member States, including my own country, Latvia. These issues were included in the Copenhagen criteria for accession. Experience will show how successfully these criteria are met, but what will happen next?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must move on from the rhetoric of human rights to a permanent and practical involvement, we must achieve the adoption of mechanisms for monitoring legally binding statutes and their implementation. A very important step in this direction has already been taken. It has already been mentioned today that the draft Constitution included a Charter of Fundamental Rights and that the draft Constitution makes reference to minority rights. In particular the adoption of a Directive on racial equality must be noted. These, however, are just the first steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking at the theme of our discussion today, <span class="italic">‘</span>Freedom and security for Union citizens<span class="italic">’.</span> Within the area of European freedom and security, freedom, security and equality must be provided for all – even refugees, immigrants and guest workers. We have a big job ahead of us.

Mr Walesa symbolises the changes leading to political freedom in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The current enlargement of the European Union means that 450 million citizens now find themselves in an area of incomparably greater freedom, security, stability, and progress. The Union’s offer of the opportunity of membership to the former Communist countries induced the latter to accomplish the huge task of reform in order to meet higher standards such as the Copenhagen standards. This demonstrates that the clear offer of such an opportunity can influence the entire domestic and foreign policy of a country seeking to join the Community. It therefore constitutes one of the most effective instruments at the Union’s disposal, and can result in increasing the range of freedoms available to its citizens and their security. There is, however, a risk that following the current enlargement, the European Union may concentrate solely or mainly on strengthening the integration process instead of exerting an effective influence on its neighbours. This should not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States, including Poland, could be very helpful in this regard. I therefore wish to emphasise the urgency of introducing a bold policy with regard to areas to the south and east of the European Union. This includes Turkey. Despite the many current political, cultural, and economic concerns, we should keep membership open to all those willing to fulfil the criteria for joining the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight that the policy of increasing freedom and security we are discussing here today and about which Commissioner Vitorino spoke, is provided for by the provisions of the draft Constitutional Treaty. I have in mind Article 58, concerning the European Union and its immediate vicinity, as well as the provisions on the crucial pillars respecting freedom and security. I would therefore like to state that in my opinion, this draft should be implemented as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, as several of my fellow Members have said, the borders of this new European Union have expanded eastwards and down towards the Mediterranean Sea. Well, we must transfer the experience we have gained and the actions we have taken to these new borders in order, above all, to guarantee citizens’ safety: Schengen will be an acceptable development only when we have firm guarantees, firmer than those we currently have.</p>
<p class="contents">Border control is a joint problem, and we must again stress that it is not a private concern for individual outer States. The instruments to put these synergies into practice are called Europol and Eurojust, which we must support with conviction and, in brief, with adequate resources. Only in this way can we fight, all together, the dangers threatening the area of freedom, security and justice: illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, prostitution, drugs and organised crime multinationals; at the top of the list, though, is one obligation: the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is a challenge, possibly just as important, waiting for those who will be here during the next parliamentary term: attainment of true European citizenship, swift asylum procedures and truly free and equal freedom of movement for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, in concluding this speech and my time in Parliament, to thank Commissioner Vitorino, flattery aside. When I arrived here in 1994, I was told that to be a good MEP I would have to criticise and perhaps argue with the Commission every day. I did not manage this: either I am not a good MEP, Mr Vitorino, or you are a good Commissioner. I think the correct answer is the latter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Union, now enlarged to twenty-five countries, has greater political, geographical and economic substance. We have begun to share our common interests, both in the area of the economy and the internal market, and in terms of the responsibilities that we face as regards the threats to stability and security, which are not confined to borders. I refer to terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of terrorism is an alarming problem that we currently face and should be given maximum priority. This is a threat to security, to our democracies and to the foundations of our civilisation; more specifically respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, respect for the law and respect for human rights are under threat. The European Union must do all that it can to protect its citizens, to tighten border controls and to improve security as regards travel documents, by introducing biometric data and by establishing visa systems and the Schengen Information System (SIS-II).</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should once again like to highlight at this juncture that, if security is to be strengthened, this must always be in compliance with the other two components of our European area, which are freedom and justice. 1 May also saw great change in the area of Justice and Home Affairs. A new institutional framework is now in force: in the area of visas, asylum and immigration, codecision with Parliament will enter into force, as will qualified majority voting in the Council. Parliament’s role will, hopefully, result in greater efficiency in addressing the repeated delays on the Council’s part, which many speakers, including Mr von Boetticher, have highlighted here.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino, who is here today, deserves praise for his excellent work in this area and his positive attitude towards working together with Parliament. It is my wish that the excellent work that he has done here helps him to rise to even higher responsibilities in our Community of Europe.</p>

This right, this freedom, is enshrined in the Treaties. It is also contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and has its own very practical dimensions. I refer to the abolition of internal border controls and to the elimination of all administrative barriers to settling and taking up work anywhere in the territory of the entire Union.</p>
<p class="contents">From the first of May, citizens of the new Member States may travel throughout the Union without passports. They have been quick to exercise this right, and have enjoyed doing so from the very first day. This has given them a real feeling of belonging to the Community, even if they still have to produce identity cards at the borders. The citizens of the new Member States of the Union understand that a partial restriction on their rights to free movement is justified, until their governments are ready for full integration into the Schengen information system.</p>
<p class="contents">The same cannot be said for the restrictions introduced by several governments concerning access to labour markets. There is no rational justification for these decisions. They are based entirely on exaggerated fears or cold political calculations with the next elections to national parliaments in mind. There is no empirical evidence that an immense wave of citizens from the new countries will flood into the old Member States of the European Union in search of work. Studies by independent research centres presented by Commissioner Wallström, for example, suggest quite the opposite. Over the course of the next five years, economic migration from the new countries of the Union to the old should not exceed 1% of the population of the ten new Members. The experience of previous enlargements suggests enlargement caused a reduction in the number of economic migrants, rather than an increase. This is what will happen this time. The citizens of the new Member States want to find work in their own countries, and they believe that membership of the Union will help them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore take this opportunity to appeal for restrictions on access to labour markets to be lifted as quickly as possible. This would certainly not be a disaster for the old countries. Further, the new Members of the Union would see it as a tangible sign that they too may enjoy the full rights and freedoms available to the citizens of the entire European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I therefore take this opportunity to express the hope that the new Constitutional Treaty will be adopted this year and that the procedures for endorsing the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States will take place within a reasonable time span. As a member of the Convention I particularly wanted the Charter of human rights and freedoms to become an integral part of the Constitutional Treaty. This is not only important for the sake of the Charter itself and its meaning in the European Union but because it has a special symbolic meaning for those of us who come from the former socialist States. It is also important for the Eurosceptics, who can see that the range of human rights and freedoms is generally more extensive than it is in our constitutions. I do think, however, that the Slovenian constitution is particularly good.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time this is a clear sign that we have joined a community of democratic States which respect and safeguard human rights and freedoms. I see Europe as a flourishing community, in which peace, prosperity and the security of people and property are not merely political slogans but a reality. We must do everything to ensure that terrorism and crime do not grow but are fundamentally reduced. We do not need large, new bureaucratic organisations at the level of the European Union, but we do need increased cooperation between police forces in the Member States. As far as possible we need to establish a uniform policy in the fight against terrorism and crime and to increase the effectiveness of our security services through joint action. It is also important that we cooperate in controlling the external borders of the European Union effectively and that balanced assistance is given to those States that bear the greatest burden in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovenia is a peaceful and safe country where people can walk the streets of our cities safely even during the hours of darkness. It is well-known that in many places in Europe it is not safe to do so. I therefore express the expectation that in addition to taking care of economic, scientific and general social development, the European Union will pay particular attention to the security of its citizens and the protection of their property. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
