<p class="contents">The European Commission has consulted on the question of copyright management since the mid-nineties. It has published a series of documents, communications and papers addressing this issue and these were followed by public consultations.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament already called for a Community framework for collective management societies in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights in its resolution of 15 January 2004 and then in its resolutions of 13 March 2007 and 25 September 2008. In this term, Parliament repeated its calls, inter alia, in its resolution of 12 May 2011 on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries and in my own report, which was adopted on 22 September 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">As you specified in your communication of 24 May 2011, the coming proposal on collective management of copyright should contribute to the creation of a true digital single market. We need pan-European and multi-territorial licensing. However, we are aware of the difficulty involved in the reorganisation of repertoires that would enable a single entity to grant licences for a number of repertoires.</p>
<p class="contents">Collective management societies must also guarantee cultural diversity by encouraging creativity, but we know that there are linguistic and cultural barriers. Collective management societies must finally ensure that all authors are looked after and paid, from international stars to less well-known authors.</p>
<p class="contents">How, in your proposal, do you intend to ensure a balance between this necessary modernisation of collective management on the one hand, particularly in terms of Internet use, and the protection and payment of authors in cultural diversity on the other?</p>
<p class="contents">My final question, Commissioner — but I think you will have been expecting it — when do you intend to submit this text to us? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, I would like to thank many of you, particularly Marielle Gallo, who spoke on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs of which she is a Member, for asking me about this aspect of the future legislative proposal on collective rights management. What is at stake? Using collective management to strengthen the single market in the age of the Internet, supporting this copyright — as I said more generally earlier with regard to intellectual property — in this day and age, Ms Gallo, which, as you know, is the age of the Internet and the age of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Collective management of copyright is a complex issue. It affects the management of both online and offline rights, not only with regard to authors but also with regard to performers, actors, producers, publishers and even broadcasters.</p>
<p class="contents">We immediately think of large management societies, such as those in charge of actual copyrights but, honourable Members, we must not forget the societies which receive payment for reproduction or resale rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If we focus solely on the collective management of actual copyrights, what we are dealing with is a sector which, as Ms Gallo reminded us, represents a value of EUR 7.5 billion worldwide and EUR 4.6 billion in Europe alone for almost 100 management societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Collective management of copyrights is complex because these management societies — around 100 in Europe — while maintaining strong roots in the various Member States and participating actively in cultural diversity in each of our Member States, must also adapt, as I mentioned just a moment ago, to the Internet and to a rapidly developing demand for multi-territorial licensing. This collective management must serve right-holders and users alike. However, it is now time for this collective management to do more for the single market as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to collective management is, first and foremost, a voluntary step, and it is also the choice that authors make most often. It allows them to obtain licences for the greatest possible number of users and for the broadest possible coverage of rights. It must protect the interests of right-holders and ensure remuneration, not only, as you said Ms Gallo, for the most well-known, the stars, but also for those who are less well-known and who have the right to the same level of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">These are balances which are indeed difficult to find and the issue of collective management has divided opinion among many interested parties. The opinions and positions are often very different. Similarly, the market is developing very quickly. The needs of yesterday are no longer the needs of today.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, having mentioned this complexity and these different approaches which partly explain, Ms Gallo, the amount of time I am taking to work seriously and conscientiously on this proposal, I would like to say a few words on this future proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication of 20 May 2011, which you mentioned, the Commission announced its intention not only to cover copyright management linked to online music but also to establish a foundation of common rules for all collective management societies, no matter their field. This decision was well received, particularly in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">From there, we are working in this objective by broadening the scope of our future proposal. All of the interested parties have been consulted. This consultation phase ended today. I led this consultation conscientiously — I will say it again — without improvising and by listening to everyone. That is why I will be presenting this proposal for a directive on behalf of the Commission — you asked me to set a deadline — next spring.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I have the opportunity to do so, I will tell you a little about this proposal. I asked my services to work on two aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The first aspect concerns horizontal rules for transparency and governance. It concerns harmonised rules for transparency and governance which will be applicable, if you wish, to all collective management societies in Europe. These rules should create fair conditions for all societies and improve their functioning to the benefit of all right-holders, including those from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we cannot neglect the fact that each collective management society manages rights on its territory (for example, rights linked to broadcasting) not only for its own members but also for members of foreign management societies. That is the first horizontal aspect of this next future proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to specific rules for online music. It is related to societies which manage copyrights for online music. While ensuring a high level of transparency and a better quality of services for authors and users, we want to propose a clear legal framework, honourable Members, to facilitate the granting of multi-territorial licences for online music by management societies. These licences should also promote the pooling of repertoires in order to reduce the number of licences needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this approach, the Commission will take into account, wherever possible, the position expressed by the European Parliament in several resolutions and working papers.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to tell you that I am working personally with all of my teams on this matter. We will be ready in the next few months and the time which has passed, which may seem long to you, has been time well spent in order to present a good, solid, balanced text to you.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that our proposal will go towards speeding up the creation of this digital single market. Collective management societies will benefit from a much clearer legislative framework, which will harmonise and define the basic principles of their functioning. In the online music sector, authors will benefit from the advantages of a larger market for their work. Finally, citizens — and particularly young people — will benefit from a greater range of innovative services.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the direction we are working towards on these two aspects and that is the deadline by which I believe we will be ready to present this text to you — subject to the approval of the European Commission and the College — in the next few weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The current 2005 recommendation from the Commission has proved insufficient in regulating the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for on-line music services.</p>
<p class="contents">Our goal is to safeguard the interests of authors in Europe and to ensure cultural diversity in a legal, fair and transparent system of competition. At present there is a climate of legal uncertainty for rights-holders, for users and especially for broadcasters, who – for instance – experience legal uncertainty as to which licensing regime would apply to their services.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission proposal should include some of the following principles:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the holders of the rights, either individuals or legal persons holding on-line rights, should be able to chose freely any collective rights managers for the management of on-line rights related to legitimate on-line music services, no matter where the rights-holder or the collective rights manager is in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, royalties collected by collective rights managers on behalf of rights-holders should be distributed fairly and without discrimination on the basis of residence or nationality or whether they are composers, performers, publishers or other categories of rights-holders.</p>
<p class="contents">Collective rights managers should be able to provide commercial users based anywhere in the European Union with pan-European and multi-territorial licences for online users, including mobile phone users, on firm and individually negotiated terms and without discrimination among users.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in the event of disputes, parties should have access to effective and inexpensive dispute settlement mechanisms which do not burden users with unreasonable legal costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It depends also on liberalisation measures addressing the obstacles and privileges that are strangling the internal digital market as well. Among these is the need for a new copyright regime, in particular for collective rights management, given that copyright represents 7% of our European gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p class="contents">Reform is urgent, Commissioner, and we have awaiting it for a long time now. It has been announced many times with deadlines and dates that have never been respected, as you have indirectly admitted. We have been waiting for this directive for over two years, just as we have been hoping that the subject of Directive 2004/48/EC on the Enforcement of Property Rights and Directive 2001/29/EC would be addressed by an up-to-date scheme of exceptions. One had hoped that it would come to pass within this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet today our debate is contaminated with ‘ideologisms’ that artificially set artists in conflict with the right of free access to the web, in a paralysing conflict that is both noxious and sterile. All this must be resolved with innovative legal and technological ideas for a new concept of artists’ rights, which begins in the first place with their management. Although interesting proposals and opinions have been put forward, no progress has been made on this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barnier, you had significant success with patents, for which I congratulate you because I hold you in high esteem. On this issue, however, you are stalling. Why? Both you and the rapporteur, Ms Gallo, have spoken of genuine difficulties which, as you have said, partly justify this delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that existing collective management companies and record companies represent powerful interests that are defending their patch. That is the main obstacle. I say no to territoriality, no to reasonable derogations, no to broad collective licences, no to incentives for new business models, no to greater transparency, no to interoperability for format shifting. All this is what makes for delay.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need are well-fashioned reforms that do not create oligopolies capable of distorting the market, the cultural industries and small players and of stifling diversity and the cultural wealth of Europe. That is why we are hoping that this ‘spring’, awaited so earnestly by all, will finally arrive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Internet makes services such as unlimited access to music, films and books at the click of a button possible, and someone who lives in the rural area where I grew up, in Kalix in northern Sweden, has the same access to culture as someone who lives in a big cultural city like Paris or London.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principles behind our copyright legislation must still be valid in the digital age too, but we also need to have the courage to see that the new era means that some old systems have to be modernised and simplified. Collective rights management is one such system that needs to be adapted to the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who are to provide the digital cultural services of the future must have a simpler time of it than is currently the case. It is unreasonable for a small company to have to employ legions of lawyers to negotiate rights in 27 countries over a long period in order to be able to provide access to a broad range of European works.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to realise that European solutions are required to tear down barriers to trade and open up opportunities for entrepreneurs. Major changes like those we are currently experiencing create nervousness and, I assume, a reflex to want to hold onto what we have instead of creating and reaching out for something better. That is how I interpret the Commission’s sluggishness in this matter. The procedure that was carried out was far too long-winded. Europe now needs political leadership which will demonstrate that we can do more and do it better. I therefore expect more of you, Commissioner Barnier, and you can be sure that I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will essentially contribute in a constructive and pragmatic way to drawing up suitable proposals for a functional internal digital market designed for the 21st century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been discussing this issue since 2005 and, since 2005, we have also had the Commission’s recommendation, which has, in fact, led to major market distortions, as a result of which small-scale rights users in Europe are coming under increasing pressure and facing numerous problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this proposal and we need it urgently! First of all, we need it urgently because the territoriality problem must be solved. However, we have a difficulty here. The world no longer simply ends at national borders and problems are not solved with small exchange relationships; it goes beyond this. The proposal is also urgent because the rights of artists in relation to collecting societies and rights users need to be strengthened and improved. That is not happening to the same extent in all Member States and in some the situation is desperate. It is also urgent because the European Parliament’s Lévai report has answered all of Parliament’s questions, though the Commission has yet to respond to it, and because, from a global perspective, the increasing market concentration of the US giants at the expense of our European rights users is helping them grab an ever bigger share of market power. This delay is now benefiting the dinosaurs of the market and not the thing that cultural diversity in Europe needs as badly as we need water for life, namely a culture outside the mainstream, which can then fertilise this same mainstream again.</p>

I agree with the proposals you have just made regarding the harmonisation of horizontal rules on transparency and regarding the rules on online music.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must insist on the aim of fair remuneration for artists. Since the start of the mandate, for several years even, the issue of remuneration for artists has been mentioned exclusively in the context of infringements to intellectual property rights, making Internet users the scapegoats for artists’ lack of earnings. Yet, we are forgetting that, for each CD, for example, authors and performers only receive, on average, 6% of the sales price and that, for websites that sell music online, they receive hardly anything, around 1% per sale.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair remuneration for artists must therefore be at the heart of our revision of collective management for the digital era. Of course, we need more transparency. In France, the Standing Monitoring Committee for management societies and distribution of rights published a damning report last year on the remuneration of the managers of these societies, for example. This committee also denounced a wave of invoices and deductions for costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Artists must be at the heart of our concerns and many voices from all of the political camps together are denouncing a system which, in the end, places more importance on intermediaries than artists — that is what Neelie Kroes said — or even an opaque, confiscatory system as the French Minister of Culture has branded it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I therefore think that, if we revise these collective management rights, our objective and our end goal must be the optimal perception of intellectual property rights. These are conditions which are not merely incidental in the fight against infringements to intellectual property rights but which represent an essential prerequisite to the respect of these rights by users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Part of the problem is the collective management of copyright. For the single market to function, it is important that it is based on the same principles throughout Europe. I expect in particular that the directive will bring an end to the practices of a number of national collecting societies. It should be borne in mind that not all authors want to be represented by such societies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary, on the basis of an analysis of best practices, to establish a means of redistributing fees for the use of original works, but above all, the legislation under preparation must be based on the reality of today.

However, the potential has not been exhausted yet and, compared to the United States or Asia, the EU still lags far behind when it comes to digital distribution. This kind of distribution over the Internet offers small-scale or young artists and musicians, in particular, an inexpensive method of reaching the widest possible audience. In turn, consumers get easy access to a wide range of creative content.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to tap the potential of the European creative industries, we need to create an appropriate legal framework which covers licensing, amongst other things. Collective rights management also allows artists at the smaller end of the scale to exercise their rights. It is not enough that Europe had a lot to offer historically in the fields of culture and creativity. We need to wake up to what these fields have to offer and promote this market in the digital world accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, I should like to thank each and every one of you for your questions. I have of course taken note of them and will bear them in mind. They have encouraged me to now finish this consultation and preparation work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I want to repeat a second time — I said it to Ms Gallo just a moment ago in my first answer — that, on an issue such as this one, taking into account of course the interests here, but also the legal complexity, the time we have taken, which has been longer than I would have liked, has been time well spent, as it has enabled us to produce an intelligent and dynamic text.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Gallo, in her first question, raised the issue that some of you also mentioned in a similar way in your own questions: how, in this proposal, will we ensure a balance between the protection of authors and cultural diversity on the one hand, access to this creativity to as many people as possible and, of course, the necessary modernisation of collective management?</p>
<p class="contents">I want to remind you, honourable Members, that these collective management societies play an important intermediary role between authors and the public. There is no obligation for authors to use collective management societies — I say this to Ms Záborská in particular — it is a voluntary choice to use these societies. They play an important role and, as you and others have said, Ms Gallo, this is a difficult task at a time when societies are investing heavily to develop multi-territorial licensing. We must not underestimate this responsibility or the technical and financial obstacles for a market which is still fragile and developing.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all copyrights societies, honourable Members, currently have the means to develop such licences and it is important that they are not left behind in the digital age. That is why I will propose measures which should allow them to choose the best means for developing multi-territorial licences within a clear legal framework which will protect the interests of their members.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Castex and Ms Lichtenberger recalled the demand for improved governance. You have given examples which have stimulated the debate and perhaps even in some cases are unusual. We need transparency and better governance. We will encourage and promote better conditions for these societies to carry out their activities but I think, like you, that the proposals we will make should improve this governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlinguer, I explained the deadline, I have accepted it, even though I know that you disapprove of it, and I would ask you for a few more weeks of patience so that we may arrive at this proposal. You and Ms Wikström wanted to ask me to bring this deadline forward. I will work as quickly as possible but you also wanted to recognise, Mr Berlinguer, that this time has also been used to make progress other important issues within the broad area of intellectual property. You yourself talked about the patent. I could have added orphan works management or the matter we just spoke about in this Chamber at the start of the afternoon, namely the observatory on infringements of intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">We will go further with a proposal to revise the directive on the application of intellectual property rights which is being prepared. I would also remind you that I asked a man whom I respect and who was my colleague in the Commission several years ago, Mr Vitorino, to be the mediator on the sensitive issue of private copying. Finally, my services are currently analysing the reactions of all the interested parties in the Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works. We will look more closely at this matter over the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Wikström mentioned, among other things, if I have understood correctly, the future of small collective management societies, since not all copyrights societies are the same size. Let us not forget that most of the revenue these societies make comes from granting licences to radio stations, television channels, cable companies and record producers. All management societies will continue to grant this type of licence while being more efficient and more transparent. Furthermore, most right-holders really appreciate access to societies in their own country in their local market and in their own language. We have no intention of removing this choice, particularly in terms of languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Wikström again and Ms Ţicău mentioned the issue of repertoires which should be accessible on a multi-territorial basis. This is important for authors, commercial users, consumers and cultural diversity in general. Even though, I will say it again, not all of these societies have the technical means to grant multi-territorial licences to the major online service providers, we will propose solutions in this text so that all repertoires are available for these licences.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Macovei mentioned in particular the issue of competition in the functioning of collective management societies. Yes, honourable Members, there will be greater transparency in the functioning of these societies and more opportunities for right-holders to make an informed choice. Yes, because a common foundation will be established along with fair ground rules for the functioning of collective management societies in Europe. Following the adoption of this text which you will undoubtedly have the opportunity to improve, it will be easier for right-holders and commercial users to compare the levels of service offered by the various collective management societies. We will thereby be able to tap into all of the creative potential that exists in Europe more efficiently, as Mr Obermayer said.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Záborská mentioned ACTA. I know that this is a concern. Just before in a previous debate I repeated what the Commission wanted to do with this text and confirmed that my colleague Karel De Gucht is willing to take part in all the debates scheduled here for the end of February and the beginning of March in a responsible, calmer way to discuss the issues relating to the ACTA agreement. That is as much as I can tell you on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank each and every one of you for asking me about these issues. I have told you what direction we are working towards in these two areas, which you will see again in this proposal on collective rights management in the next few weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, collective management is handled through bodies which collect royalties, but which have become an obstacle to effective copyright reform in Europe. The current problems in this area were very well highlighted in Belgium when a group of undercover reporters showed that the collective management company SABAM (Société d’Auteurs Belge – Belgische Auteurs Maatschappij) was collecting royalties for artists who do not exist. This is why I think that a timetable ought to be specified for this legislative proposal, as well as the scope of its application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
