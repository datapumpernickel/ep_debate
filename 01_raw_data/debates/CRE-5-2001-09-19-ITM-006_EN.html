<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, at the instigation of the General Affairs Council, the Council of Transport Ministers held a meeting on 14 September. The Council reviewed the urgent measures taken by each Member State in order to guarantee the safety of air travel. It also set up a special working group, comprising representatives of the Member States and of the European Commission, which is responsible for increasing cooperation and coordination among the Member States to ensure the uniform and effective application of security measures, including by legislative means. A preliminary report on this subject is to be laid before the Council of Transport Ministers meeting scheduled for 15 October next. Lastly, the Transport Ministers have decided to draw up common proposals on the subject of security measures. On behalf of the Union, these proposals will then be put to the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on 25 September next.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will meet on 20 September. It will assess the intelligence-sharing mechanism and the respective roles in this context of institutions such as Europol and Eurojust, as well as assessing the two proposals for framework decisions it received from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal concerns the approximation of criminal law in the Member States with a view to developing a common definition of terrorist action and establishing a common system for punishing criminal acts.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal concerns the introduction of a European warrant of arrest. The Council will consider instruments employed in the investigation of criminal acts and will ensure that a suitable balance is struck between the protection of privacy and the needs of the investigative authorities. Finally, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will examine a number of measures aimed at strengthening transatlantic judicial cooperation in the areas of policing, intelligence and immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism requires the use of all kinds of instruments to monitor financial flows, to identify suspects, to make air travel safer, to monitor arms trafficking as well as many other aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the best placed organisation to provide a global response to the fight against terrorism. The fight against international terrorism will be a long, drawn-out battle. As the Heads of State and Governments have stated, the European Union will have to assume an even greater role in managing regional tension and conflicts if it is to stamp out international terrorism. The inclusion of fragile nations and regions in a peaceful world governed by the rule of law will be a powerful weapon in the battle against the scourge of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will be much more effective if it can further develop its Common, Foreign and Security Policy and can activate its Common European Security Policy at the earliest opportunity. The Common, Foreign and Security Policy will have to be used preventatively, rather than as a means of reprisal. If the battle against terrorism is to be truly effective, we will also need to strengthen our policies with regard to the countries and the regions of the world that appear to nurture terrorism. We will have to enhance and deepen our political dialogue and use every possible means at our disposal to combat, stifle and finally eradicate international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is an emerging world power. As such we have a greater number of responsibilities, which we must shoulder together. The tragic events of 11 September 2001 will also prompt us to develop closer ties with the United States, which will go beyond the established mechanisms for cooperation. The transatlantic dialogue will enable us to exchange information and share our respective assessments of the threat posed by terrorism, in all its guises.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Louis Michel, will travel to Washington this evening for talks with the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, on transatlantic cooperation. He will report back on his meeting to the extraordinary meeting of the European Council, which is scheduled for Friday 21 September. This extraordinary meeting of the European Council was called to review all the political, diplomatic, economic, legal and financial resources that are at the Union’s disposal to combat terrorism. The Council will also be an opportunity to reflect on the EU’s diplomatic role in stabilising regional conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be effective, the fight against terrorism must be able to rely on the efforts of all the countries that share our values of freedom, tolerance and democracy. For this reason, the Presidency has sought to ensure that third countries are fully involved in the actions taken by the European Union. The candidate countries unanimously backed the declarations of the General Affairs Council and the declarations made by the Heads of State and Government. Third countries have also been invited, via the foreign embassies of Member States, to confirm their commitment to the unrelenting fight against terrorism. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union can thus help to build a world of peace and legality for all nations.</p>

This is why my colleague Chris Patten, who hoped to give a speech on external relations with particular emphasis on the fight against terrorism, could not attend this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I would like to stress that we support the principle that the Union must make more effort to give a consistent message where the fight against terrorism is concerned and that we need a European agenda to acknowledge the key role that must be assigned to the United Nations Organisation in the fight against global terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we welcome the initiative by the Belgian Presidency to schedule an extraordinary and informal meeting of the European Council for next Friday and we are pleased to take part in today’s debate in the European Parliament. We must show the American people and the American authorities that they have the solidarity of the whole European Union. But in order for the Union to influence the guidelines on the fight against terrorism, we must give a consistent message.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon. The threats are new, however, and the tools used by the terrorists are new and more sophisticated.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragic events in the United States of America sadly demonstrate the timeliness of the two proposals that were today approved by the Commission, which are closely related and which are also in response to a request by the European Parliament that was approved at the September plenary session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to clarify that our proposals are not a response to the events that occurred in the United States of America. The proposals are primarily a response to the fact that, even in our Member States, we have problems regarding terrorism that we must resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been working on these proposals for more than a year, working closely with the European Parliament, and we would like to stress that these proposals will help Europe to co-operate in a much more effective manner in the fight against terrorism, and therefore to collaborate in the fight at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism constitutes one of the greatest threats to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and free economic and social development. In recent years, we have witnessed an increase in terrorist activities both within the European Union’s borders and worldwide. This increase in the power of terrorism is characterised by a profound change in the nature of terrorist attacks. The actual or potential effects of armed attacks are increasingly devastating and fatal. The increased dependence of our society on technological evolutions is giving rise to new forms of terrorism. Increasingly, terrorism stems from the activities of networks operating at international level, which have very close links with other types of organised crime based in several countries, exploiting the legal loopholes arising from the geographical limits of investigations and sometimes enjoying extensive logistical and financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">Today more than any other time, therefore, we need measures to fight against this scourge. The Treaty on European Union expressly lays down that the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice shall include progressively adopting measures establishing rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the field of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament recently adopted a resolution, which shows the determination of representatives of European citizens to conduct a fierce and effective battle against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing a two-fold response:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we are proposing a common definition of acts of terrorism and to set across the Member States levels of penalties that reflect the seriousness of these acts. Terrorists take advantage of any differences in legal treatment in the Member States, particularly where the offence is not referred to in one of the State’s national legislation. We must admit that the situation is very different from one Member State to another. Most Member States have no specific regulations on terrorism and terrorist acts are punished as common offences. On the other hand, six Member States have specific laws or legal instruments concerning terrorism where the words ‘terrorism’ or ‘terrorist’ are expressly mentioned. The Commission’s proposal for a framework decision on terrorism aims to introduce approximation in this area and it provides a list of offences from murder to other actions that can be equally devastating, albeit more insidious, and which are described as terrorist acts if intentionally committed by individuals or by groups against one or more countries, their institutions or people, with the aim of intimidating them and seriously altering or destroying the political, economic or social structures of a country or to destroy them. It is proposed that such acts incur prison sentences ranging from a minimum of 2 years to 20 years of prison depending on the severity of the offence.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission is presenting a proposal of a horizontal nature, a fairly ambitious proposal, I must admit, which is to replace the traditional extradition procedures by a system of surrendering persons to judicial authorities on the basis of a European arrest warrant. This proposal, which also supplements the proposal on terrorism although its scope is wider, is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments, which the Tampere European Council hoped would become the cornerstone of European judicial cooperation. The underlying idea is that where the judicial authority of one Member State requests the surrender of a person, either for final sentencing or because this person is undergoing criminal proceedings, the decision must be recognised and executed throughout the European Union in order to simplify and accelerate procedures as far as possible. A time limit of three months is proposed and the reasons for refusing extradition are to be restricted to a limited number. In particular, the principle of double criminal liability and the exception in favour of nationals are to be abolished. The most important criterion in the European Union is not that of nationality but that of a person’s place of residence. The proposal thus seeks to facilitate, wherever possible, the execution of the sentence in the country of arrest, if that is where the person is most likely to be successfully reintegrated into society.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, tomorrow I shall have the opportunity to present these proposals to the ministers at the extraordinary Council meeting called by the Belgian Presidency to discuss the European Union’s contribution to the fight against the threat of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The benefit of this meeting is that it provides us with the opportunity to ask the ministers questions of principle at a political level and to try to resolve them. This concerns our legislative proposals as well as a whole raft of measures that should be taken in order to step up our action at an operational level and to improve and make more effective our collaboration with our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission does not have any experience at an operational level, but it believes that the European Union should take a number of measures internally, including to ensure that Europol becomes an operational instrument in the fight against the various forms of crime, one of which is terrorism. For this to be done, we must implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on Europol, which provide for its participation in joint enquiry teams and the possibility of inviting Member States to launch investigations, which also requires a major review of the content of the Europol convention, including questions of judicial control and democratic control. We need strong commitment from the Member States straight away in order to establish genuine and effective cooperation between their intelligence services and to demonstrate that they share mutual trust. This is also necessary in order to bring about a significant improvement in the conditions in which Member States’ police and intelligence services provide Europol with the information needed to carry out their work, the most important part of which, in my opinion, is the prevention of terrorist acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is important for the Union to strengthen international cooperation and this will involve taking all the necessary measures regarding judicial assistance, extradition, police and judicial cooperation in order to improve our ability to pre-empt and fight international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are some ideas formulated by the Commission and which were put to the European Parliament and the European Council. At this difficult time when the citizens of our Member States are, I am sure, contemplating an uncertain and insecure future, I believe that the best political message we can give them is that this gives us a unique opportunity to show that the European project really does have an added value and that is to guarantee them a future of freedom, security and justice.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats greatly welcomes the special summit of Heads of State and Government to be held on Friday at the Belgian Presidency's initiative, and you, Madam President, will of course be there too, to speak for the European Parliament. We in the European Parliament can take real pride in passing the Watson Report in the last part-session; it points the way ahead for our common struggle against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Next Friday's summit here in Brussels should, in many ways, be a signal. It should again signal to our American friends that the diabolical attacks on Washington and New York were not only an assault on the United States, but on the whole of the civilised world and on every one of us. These attacks struck at our ideals of democracy, human rights and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">What was said in our deeply moving session last week is still true today. In the Conference of Presidents this morning, I asked the High Representative, Mr Solana – who is at this very moment on his way to Washington with Mr Michel and Mr Patten – to tell Secretary of State Powell, when they meet, that we, the freely-elected Parliament of Europeans in the European Union, expressed our solidarity in the immediate aftermath of these fearful events.</p>
<p class="contents">In Washington, however, we will also say that we expect not only decisions to be announced there for our European leaders to take note of, but also genuine discussions and consultation to take place, so that whatever action is necessary, and responsibility for it, may be shared by Europeans and Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have the highest respect for Mr Solana. In future, however, we must ensure that we can debate with the High Representative of the European Union here in the European Parliament as well. I believe there is room for improvement here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Friday's summit must also send a signal to the Middle East. We urge Israel and the Palestinians to hold talks now. Now is not the time to refuse to hold talks, or to cancel them, but a time for dialogue and confidence-building measures, so that peace may be achieved there.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must repeat: those who now refuse dialogue shut themselves out from our sympathy and solidarity. At this time most of all, we need peace developments and confidence-building measures in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We need a signal to the Arabic and Islamic world. Our group's Bureau met this morning and decided to recommend to you, Madam President, that we should, as a European Parliament, meet as soon as possible with parliamentarians from the Arabic and Islamic world in the context of the Mediterranean Forum, that is to say, with those States with which we are linked in the Barcelona process and in the Mediterranean Dialogue. Allow us now to send this signal, so that they may know that we seek partnership and friendship.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to another aspect, which I believe must be the essential operational content of the summit here in Brussels on Friday. Mr Vitorino, we thank you for presenting these proposals today. We must make Europol into a real instrument for combating crime, and we urge Member States to give Europol the information it needs to do this, something which has not happened in the past. As we know, only one Member State does this reasonably adequately at present; the others have to date refused to.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very much in favour of introducing a European arrest warrant, and now is the time to act. If there is anyone who now wants to stop Europeans going from strength to strength, who does not support European cooperation in the name of Europol, then they are fundamentally denying solidarity not only to Europeans, but also to our American friends, because in combating crime we must also be united against terrorism, if we are to stand alongside our American friends and partners.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, our group has tabled an amendment to the Budget for the year 2002. We want to put the necessary resources at Europol's disposal to enable it to be truly operationally effective. The time for words is now past! We must act as Europeans. At the same time, however, we must act calmly and with deliberation, and above all we must resolve conflicts peacefully wherever we can. A military operation is never an act of retaliation, but must always lead to greater security. Let us act calmly and with deliberation, but let us act consistently, and above all let us make our contribution to the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Earth!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last week we formally expressed our sympathies for all the victims of these attacks, who came from America, Europe and the whole of the world; we expressed our solidarity with the United States and, now, with pain but also with determination, we must respond to global terrorism, to this mixture of fanaticism and advanced technology which threatens our civilisation and our open, democratic and multicultural society.</p>
<p class="contents">We must send a very clear message to our fellow citizens: terrorism can injure, it can kill, but no democracy has ever been destroyed by terrorism and that is our greatest strength. We must therefore work together: Parliament produced the Watson report, the Commission has speeded up its work and this week a Special Council has been called. I must stress that yesterday and today the President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian Minister for External Affairs, Mr Michel, the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Solana, and the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, have taken part in debates in Parliament on this issue. I believe that we should welcome this willingness to participate, which increases transparency and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">We Socialists must respond on the basis of one fundamental notion: the global response must be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368 of this year, which establishes that we must work together to bring the organisers, sponsors and perpetrators of the attacks and their accomplices to justice. This is the basis of the worldwide coalition which we are building with the United States, with the candidate countries, with Russia and with all the states of the world which share our universal values. I would add another point: the ratification of the International Criminal Court must be accelerated so that we may have a global instrument of justice in this very field.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also work firmly and with perseverance, acting within the framework of a multidimensional policy which relates to what we are doing in the United Nations. This explains NATO’s decision to invoke Article 5.</p>
<p class="contents">We must state that poverty, injustice or conflict are not causes which can justify barbarism. No conflict between East and West, between Islam and Christianity, between the traditional and the modern, can explain why killing innocent people can bring progress in the world.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Parliament, those of us sitting here from different peoples, of different beliefs, ideologies and religions, demonstrates that we Europeans have found a response to fanaticism and intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done to create our policy? A series of contributions have been made here. The Commission has brought forward certain measures and there are others which the Commission and the Council could activate more quickly. For example, they could speed up the implementation of the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, they could speed up the ratification of the international conventions against terrorism – and this also falls within the competence of the Member States – and in particular the convention for the suppression of terrorist funding. It must not be the case, as appears to be happening, that we are assisting in the funding of terrorist organisations through stock exchange speculation. There must also be increasing cooperation between intelligence services and a strengthening of Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President – and this must be stressed – on the basis of the information given us by Mr Solana this morning, we must activate and pursue our policy of finding an opening, an opportunity, for peace in the Middle East, founded on the Mitchell report. Confidence-building measures must not be viewed as recompense, but rather such measures must be an integral part of this process. And we must do so jointly with the United States. We must send them the message that they should not hide behind imaginary shields, that they should share with us in the responsibility to achieve a world which lives in peace, justice, freedom and security.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, last week's attacks on innocent civilians in New York and Washington shocked and outraged the civilised people across the world. They show the difficulties faced by any state, especially a democracy, in defending its citizens against terrorists. These atrocities and the subsequent search for those responsible also highlight the weaknesses of our defence of the civilian population and throw into sharp relief the painfully slow progress of EU cooperation in justice and home affairs, so boldly trumpeted in Amsterdam and in Tampere. As the Americans seek the arrest of people on European soil who may be responsible, they must shake their heads in disbelief at the multitude of bilateral extradition agreements, which they will need to employ.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Commissioner Vitorino's statement. The proposals he has put forward today take on board the key recommendations of the report we adopted on 5 September, to which Mr Poettering so kindly referred. They deserve urgent consideration and swift action by Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at their meeting tomorrow. If they are adopted by Council, they will represent a major step forward in forging a common EU anti-terrorism policy. I challenge any minister who may resist these proposals in the secrecy of the Council chamber to explain publicly to citizens in their own country, or across Europe, why they are holding up effective common action in this field.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However welcome and important the Commission's proposals are, they are clearly insufficient. They provide answers to the world as it was before last Tuesday. They deal with terrorist crimes within the Union but do nothing to improve cooperation with countries outside the EU. They fail to solve conflicts of competence between judicial authorities. They leave cooperation and the vital matter of police affairs subject to a national veto, as Commissioner Vitorino said. If the EU is serious about combating terrorism, we must gear up the operational instruments of common action. We must enable Europol to cooperate effectively with third countries. We must give an external dimension to Eurojust. We must act decisively too, to combat money laundering in the conciliation currently under way and we must develop common policies for the collection and sharing of criminal intelligence, as Mrs Neyts pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures are needed too in foreign and security policy: greater cooperation in the UN, in the G8, in the Council of Europe, urging Member States to sign the UN Convention on the financing of terrorism; export controls on sensitive products and tighter association agreements with third countries. But we must guard against a blurring of the second and the third pillars, which last week's Council declaration suggested, and guard too against upsetting the delicate balance between the needs of security and the civil liberties, which our citizens enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask whether now is not the time to consign to the rubble of history the clumsy, outdated second and third pillars of the EU cooperation and make their contents core competences of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fig leaf of national sovereignty serves only to hide the impotence of nation states. Democracy faces supranational challenges and these require a supranational response. Our policies will need public support, so our policymaking will need proper democratic oversight and control. I believe that this House stands ready to play its part. We must now call on our national leaders to show the courage and the vision which the moment demands.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we must put aside the understandable emotions of the last ten days and the messages of solidarity and compassion and contemplate the future calmly. The criminal attacks carried out in the United States on 11 September, which cost thousands of lives, force us to seriously consider the course of action we need to take in order to prevent this ever happening again, to break up criminal and terrorist networks and to avoid violence spiralling out of control. This violence is also a fact of life for very many people in this world – I am thinking of the people of Afghanistan in particular, who, as you mentioned earlier, are being subjected to a war that has raged for decades, as well as the intolerable Taliban political regime.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I welcome the attitude of the High Representative of the Common, Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, particularly in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the positions adopted several weeks ago by the Council and the Presidency, represented by Mr Michel. The actions of Mr Michel are of great benefit to the European Union and to the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to have effective political action, we need a firm and determined approach. This does not mean, however, responding to the acts of barbarism, such as those perpetrated on 11 September, with military action that would cause civilian casualties and cost innocent lives.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our representatives are convinced of this, and I believe that the comments made by the chairs of the political groups and other Members were also along these lines. I would hope, however, that the European Union, represented by the President of the Council, also convinces the American authorities, President Bush and his aides of this, as they have been speaking about revenge for several days, which causes concern for me personally, as well as for the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation certainly calls for an international and multilateral response. We need global instruments to manage global problems. International terrorism is a global phenomenon. First of all, we must of course take a European and Community approach, but we work at an international level, and we must therefore take appropriate action, in other words, on both levels. I therefore believe that the European Union must demand that the perpetrators and sponsors of criminal actions such as those of 11 September are brought before the International Criminal Tribunal, which would of course be the most appropriate body to judge such acts, which are, as we have already said, crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">A multilateral approach is required – all the more so because there is a strong risk of seeing a coalition forming in Muslim countries against the West, at the instigation of the most fanatical regimes in power – in Afghanistan particularly – which could persuade other countries that we are hostile towards them. I therefore believe that it is in our interest to establish as close a dialogue as possible with Arab countries and with Muslim countries in general. In my view, the proposal that I made yesterday to the Conference of Presidents is positive, and this was reiterated by all the chairs of the political groups. In addition, you have announced an initiative by some authorities to implement the proposal, namely to organise an international Euro-Arab or even better, a Euro-Muslim forum, so that discussions can be held on international problems, which will, without doubt, be constructive in terms of the future of our relations and the future of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for the Commission proposals on the fight against terrorism, but I believe that we must also deal with the root causes of the problem. I would like to mention, in the thirty seconds that remain, a key problem. Funding of terrorist networks lies at the root of this evil and unfortunately we have tools which are in place and which enable funding of these networks, in other words, bank secrecy and tax havens. I believe that the European Union must take steps in order to eliminate these two elements and therefore destroy the root cause of this evil.</p>

The coming period – perhaps the next few days – will certainly provide it with the opportunity to display its determination and ability to face three challenges, in particular, which are posed by this tragic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the first challenge will be for countries to decide to be willing partners of the United States. At yesterday’s debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, one of my colleagues spoke of ‘allied but not aligned countries’. This does not mean, of course, that they lack the necessary and legitimate solidarity, particularly in the common fight to seek out, judge and punish those responsible for this act of barbarism or, more generally, to break up the terrorist networks. On the other hand, this means that we must have the courage to make clear to our American counterparts what we are perfectly willing to do and what do not sanction under any circumstances. Yesterday and this morning, Mr Solana quite rightly stressed that it is vital that our fight against terrorism is not perceived by those in the Arab and Muslim world as a war against their civilisation, or even as a crusade, to use one of the most alarming expressions of President Bush. Yesterday, the High Representative for the CFSP already recommended, in the same spirit, that we should be careful, that we should seek to humiliate nobody, avoid any confusion and not create rifts, which would be a huge mistake. I welcome these responsible words. My group hopes that these words will be translated into an outright refusal by the European Union to allow itself to be drawn into wartime thinking, into a trap which would produce more bloodshed and more innocent victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge that we must face is directly related to what I have just said. We must avoid creating a division, but also review and revive the Euro-Mediterranean relationship. Now is not the time, in my view, to discuss free-trade zones with our partners of the South-Eastern Mediterranean. We should instead talk about development, political dialogue, how to bring our societies closer and about human dignity. And one of the practical commitments to make in line with this strategic choice is primarily to take concerted action to resolve the Middle East conflict fairly. I appreciate the efforts made by Mr Solana and all the European Union representatives in the region. These efforts are bearing initial fruit but we can all see that this situation is extremely fragile. This is therefore the time to make every endeavour to work not against but in partnership with the United States and other actors, particularly in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the third challenge we face is that of working on a new approach to international security. Does the tragedy of 11 September not illustrate the failure of the way in which the world has been managed since the fall of the Berlin wall? There are so many unresolved conflicts! There are so many powerful but hidden forces at work! There are so many destabilising forces! Pursuing a unilateralist approach is not a response to this deep-rooted evil. We should combat it with genuine cooperation on a global scale which respects the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter. Taking military action or clamping down with law and order is not the way to respond. We need an ambitious and multi-faceted policy for crisis prevention. Citizens everywhere – in Africa, in the Mediterranean, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in the United States itself and often in the Member States – expect to see a revision of world governance. At the moment, Europe, in particular, is being called upon to do this. This is an opportunity to be seized. From this perspective, the coming days could be the moment of truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pasqua (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that we have already had the opportunity to discuss the root of the problem in the past and that we will have further opportunities to do so in the future. In this debate, therefore, I shall not discuss the general philosophy of the course of action to take. I would simply like to reiterate a few points, which some of our leaders now seem to have forgotten. We must realise that our first problem is identifying our enemy. We must not have any illusions – there are Islamic fundamentalists that have decided to carry out attacks against Western democracies. We must be aware of this. You must also be aware that there are more or less dormant terrorist organisations in all of our countries and they could very easily become active overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to add something to the extremely interesting comments and thoughts of Commissioner Vitorino, and that is I hope the European Union will cease to subsidise the States that harbour or assist terrorists. I believe that this is a practical step that we ourselves could take and one that could be taken fairly swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we very clearly cannot contemplate taking any action worthy of that name, unless there is also sincere political cooperation between States, first and foremost between Member States of the European Union. I can remember a time, not so long ago, and I am not sure that this period is behind us, when the ‘every man for himself’ mentality still prevailed and we accepted the presence of some organisations on our own soil on the condition that no action would be taken, even if this meant action would be carried out in a neighbouring country. I therefore feel that we must have true solidarity and it must be clearly expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that I believe we must realise that, in order for action combating terrorism to be worthwhile, it must be preventive. We must, therefore, enhance the work of the intelligence services. I listened very carefully to everything that was said earlier about the need for Europol to be effective. I am fully in favour of enhancing Europol’s effectiveness, but this will not enable you to begin fighting against terrorism instantly. We need genuine, immediate cooperation between the intelligence and security services, a sincere exchange of information and for States to be able to take the necessary measures, whatever some States might think – and, for the moment, it is the States who are responsible for security as part of their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not elaborate any further. That is what I wanted to say this evening and I would stress one thing. I have been listening to a philosophical debate on whether the action against the United States is an act of war or an act of terrorism. Given the magnitude of these acts, I believe that they are acts of war. And if we do not realise that they may well only be the first of many, then we will pay an extremely high price for our blindness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States has already lost some of its prestige by attacking Iraq for poor strategic reasons, and by failing to secure a victory. It is primarily the United States’ systematic alignment with the State of Israel’s expansionist policy, and which the Americans had tried to compensate for by supporting extremist Islamic organisations, that has caused a sense of the most profound injustice to spread throughout the Arab countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the policy of colonisation put in place after the Six Day War as well as the unjustified presence of American troops in the region are therefore condemned. Unless the State of Israel gives up its racist policy and evacuates the settlements established on the West Bank of Jordan, the Arab world, in response to a legitimate appeal, will rise up and will destabilise the leaders of the Arab peninsula. And why is such importance given to the State of Israel, which has excessive military capabilities and only exists because of the will of the United States?</p>
<p class="contents">It is out of the question for France and Europe to take part in a new crusade against the Arab world, whether this takes the form of military action, extraditions or European arrest warrants. France is not a member of NATO and NATO is not concerned by Afghanistan. On the contrary, France will find its strategic interests lie in resolutely supporting the Arab world in its fight against racism in the policy pursued by the State of Israel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the European Union, it will be necessary for us to develop an anti-terrorist policy in harmony with the United States. We owe this to the victims and those left behind. I would therefore like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the speed with which proposals are now being submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">This fight is not a fight against Islam or its followers. It is a fight against those who aim to reach their goals by terror, whatever so-called justification of their actions they try to put forward.

<p class="contents">However, this change of approach must apply to the forthcoming provisions and must also be evident through a systematic revision of the texts that have already been adopted, in the light of the need for the security and protection of our people, which is now a priority. The Council must carry out this revision as soon as possible so that it can reform, and, if necessary, abolish all the provisions that may be used to establish and develop terrorist networks in our countries, whether they relate, for instance, to Community transit, border controls, family reunification or application for refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot disregard the fact that people living on the fringes of the law are entering our countries and then also complain that terrorist networks are prospering on this breeding ground that we ourselves created. We will have the opportunity tomorrow to align our actions with our words, since two reports are on the agenda, which contain recommendations that run counter to the requirement for security and for an anti-terrorism fight that we claim to want to prioritise. We cannot possibly vote in favour of the Watson report, which has no explanatory statement, that dramatically widens the provisions on implementing the right to asylum, to the point where this essential right is changed beyond recognition and where the option to carry out checks is irresponsibly taken from Member States’ authorities. However, I would like to praise the courage of the first rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who refused to have his name associated with such excesses. In the same way, is this really the right time to adopt the Coelho report, the second paragraph of which calls on the United Kingdom and Ireland to abolish all their border controls as soon as possible? Is this request not somewhat mistimed?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have the chance to be responsible and efficient by appealing to the Council to review our legislation in its entirety, in the light of the need for security. Failing that, we can go into tomorrow’s debate trying not to be overly schizophrenic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first thing we must do is to share in the pain of the American people. Please allow me to say that we Spaniards fully understand the suffering of the victims. But in the immediate aftermath we must react determinedly in order to defend our freedom and to do justice to the victims, showing the terrorists and their accomplices that their objectives have failed. As in other eras of our history, it is essential that we reaffirm our democratic values in order to destroy the totalitarian course which terrorism takes us along.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has demonstrated its unequivocal commitment to combating terrorism, and the Watson report is a clear example of this. But, now in particular, we must continue to put our political weight and impetus behind the concrete initiatives presented to us by the European Commission. The President of my Group has presented certain budgetary initiatives aimed at strengthening the role of Europol. Let us hope that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs – and I appeal to its Chairman – may, for its part, set an agenda allowing it to present to Parliament a proposal this year, which will allow the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies to finish their work in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions have an inescapable responsibility to speed up procedures in order to provide the justice system with Community instruments which will make their work against terrorism and organised crime more effective. The European Commission, and in particular Commissioner Vitorino, must be aware that it can count on the support of Parliament in order to guarantee concerted cooperation and action in tracking down these criminals, because this is the way to put an end to terror. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has been mentioned here, a common definition of terrorism for all Member States, a European arrest warrant – which has been called for for some time – and the elimination of extradition seemed to us to be essential issues when Parliament asked for them on the 5th. But in that same report Parliament also sent more than one political message to the other Community institutions: it asked for consideration of the fact that certain acts – and I quote – ‘are orchestrated and carried out by groups organised at international level’ and indicated that there were States behind these actions and that this must be confronted.</p>
<p class="contents">On 5 September, Mr President, this Parliament took the lead in asking the other institutions to adopt a firm attitude towards these issues. We already had the commitment that Commissioner Vitorino would react positively. On the 11th, Mr President, very soon afterwards, we realised that we had arrived late, dramatically late, and that the problem had exploded, not in the European Union, but in the United States, in an even more spectacular way – not dramatic, since it is always dramatic – than we have experienced here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson modestly tells us that what he asked for in his report is useful only within the European Union. I do not agree. I believe that, if we take this series of initiatives, we can make progress on an internal action which, as Mr Poettering said, would be a demonstration of our solidarity with the United States. If we, given the haste which is now required – and haste was already required – make more rapid progress in offering this example of how there can be an operational reaction on a supranational level in the fight against terrorism. We will be sending the best indication of solidarity with the United States. We will be offering the best image, the best option for work in this supranational field against organised crime, as the United Nations recently requested in Palermo.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the case of other measures, such as combating money laundering and so many others which are on the table in the Council, we will not wait until we have to act in haste, until there are other dramatic events, in order to implement them. I believe that they are all essential to defending the world and, above all, freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I witnessed among the Americans, and certainly in their administration, more restraint than we generally give them credit for over here, or than we can infer from the sometimes unfortunately chosen words of the President.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our American colleagues quite clearly said that the time for fine words is over. I believe that they are right. This is not only true of the relationship we have with them, but also of the action this Parliament intends to take. If we want to talk about punishing terrorists, then we have, in fact, already missed the boat.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can also talk about deterrence from time to time. This would involve cooperation among police forces, examining magistrates and intelligence services. Commissioner, I hope that your proposals will be dealt with as soon as possible, as I am sure they will be. Then it will become clear who in this House is for or against cooperation, who truly wants to make headway and who does not.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, I hope that at your meetings behind closed doors, it will also be clear to us who is for and against, who wants to carry on and who does not, so that we can draw our own conclusions and make our own judgments.

But I welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission set to work at full tilt to formulate proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have globalisation of terrorism. Everyone is vulnerable. But we can also turn our vulnerable world into a safer world. That is the challenge. However, it requires multilateral cooperation in a global fight against terrorism. This is the positive element that I am trying to glean from the fact that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked: that it is seen as a sign of solidarity. I am not in favour of a blank cheque for any old military action which would claim more innocent victims and would create resentment and frustrations. I would rather see an invitation to enter into consultation and dialogue across the oceans, even though there is the risk of it not being seen in that light.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be aware that our people are anxious, that many people fear that we will simply be dragged along by a war machine. We should realise that we must explain what our intentions are.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make this vulnerable world safer by providing political solutions to endless conflicts such as that in the Middle East. We must bring hope to large parts of the world that have to live in despair. Without a fair world order, stability and peace remain a distant dream, and there will always be a breeding ground for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted with the unanimous will that has been expressed over the past couple of days and that has been echoed by the Council and the Commission on this platform. We now look forward to action, rather than words, for as regards providing Europe with the resources to achieve these goals, some of our Member States have in the past persisted in throwing up barriers. How long have we been waiting for the cooperation necessary to turn Europol into an effective instrument? This was called for back at Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Mr Vitorino, the extradition of terrorists is the cornerstone of the fight against terrorism. But it remains to be seen whether we can all agree. The President-in-Office of the Council listed various instruments for the prevention of terrorism, but will we ever succeed in monitoring the flow of capital which feeds terrorism worldwide? Will we ever want to, and be able to, exercise effective control over the arms trade? Or will the economic arguments prevail tomorrow once more over the arguments for security and prevention of terrorism? For terrorism exists, fanaticism exists, injustice exists. There are many weapons which terrorists have not yet used but which are at their disposal thanks to our technological society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terror does not pave the way for justice: it is the shortest road to hell. We condemn and deplore this appalling crime; we utterly condemn those who planned and perpetrated it. Our empathy with the suffering victims, with the pain of their families and the pain of the entire American people at difficult times such as this is no less than the expression of our total commitment to preserving the unique nature of the human race.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not my words but some of the things Palestinian intellectuals, politicians and ministers such as Mr Yaser Abed Rabbo, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Mahmoud Darwish have said. They are powerful statements, and they give us hope for they come from people who live and suffer under the Israeli military occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">At times like these, we must all – people, States and institutions – act with the utmost responsibility and determination to remove terrorism from the face of the earth and put a stop to the globalisation of poverty, injustice and war for ever.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Words must replace arms’ as Mr Solana said. Therefore, no words must be allowed to provoke hatred or promote the ‘dead or alive’ cowboy culture: as the women against war say, between killing and death there lies a third way, which is life. No one must be exempt from training in love of peace and respect for the law, especially Heads of State. Today, a glimmer of hope for the future has come from Palestine and Israel with the announcement of a truce. It is a faint chance, I know, but it is vital that we do not let it go. The European Union has contributed to the possibility of dialogue being resumed. The Union’s political role must grow and, if and as this role grows, the Union must uphold the law with increasing determination. Just as we told Mr Arafat that he must be resolute in controlling terrorism, so we must make it quite clear to Mr Sharon that he cannot continue to get away with seizing Palestinian land, building settlements, killing and besieging Palestinians in villages or, as he did yesterday morning, destroying the Gaza port which is still under construction and funded by the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take tangible action, reassuring the Palestinians that they will have a safe State to live in and assuring Israel that nobody is questioning its existence, that it is its colonialist settlement policy, not its existence, which is in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, in the Lebanon, I and an Italian delegation met President Lahoud. He stated quite clearly that he rejected terrorism, but he stressed emphatically that resolution of the Palestinian issue and development of political and economic cooperation with Europe and the Arab world are essential. We must believe in our own ability to bring peace and respect for the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In April, Commander Massoud came to the European Parliament seeking support for his opposition to the fundamentalist Taliban regime. We welcomed him as a friend, just as we empathised with the victims of the fundamentalist regime in Algeria and the other countries where citizens, politicians and journalists have been massacred, even including Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Commander Massoud is dead, killed by a suicide terrorist attack just a few hours before other terrorists caused the absurd, appalling, atrocious carnage in the United States. Clearly, terrorists and fundamentalists had planned a precise sequence of events, the first step being the elimination of the most powerful opponent to the Taliban regime.</p>
<p class="contents">If we genuinely want to combat and eradicate terrorism and its bases, its economic power and its message of hatred of democracy and freedom, we must give our full support to the Northern Alliance now: what we denied Commander Massoud when he was alive we owe to him now he is dead. We owe it to the men and women who are fighting for freedom. We owe it to all those who are combating terrorism and fundamentalism in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call upon the European Union to think again about whether it needs to establish effective border controls, even suspending Schengen temporarily, and, in any case, as President Pasqua has already said, to stop giving aid to those countries which harbour, fund and protect terrorist and criminal organisations. We call for regulation of the use of the Internet, for rules to be established at last, for, as we know, the lack of rules governing the use of the Internet make it easy for terrorism to gain support and operate at international level. We call for the headquarters of those organisations which claim to be fighting religious wars, advocate violence and tolerate their members perpetrating terrorism to be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, we call upon the European Union to have the courage to hold a Euro-Mediterranean Conference to discuss our commitment to peace, where we can work together and defeat those continuing to sow hatred and violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would point out, in any case, that one of the organisations with which Osama bin Laden is linked is called the ‘International Front for Fighting Jews and Crusades’. I would also point out that part of the influx of billions of dollars of funding dispensed every year to Muslim charities and aid organisations is ultimately used to finance fundamentalist terrorism. In addition to this, the profits from banks, Islamic businesses and financial institutions, located in tax havens, which are now, at last, regulated and identified on the international market as well, help to support the international Jihad terrorist force. Here in Europe, there are Islamic centres and mosques which have been providing hospitality, screens and even false passports for fundamentalists connected to terrorist groups for years and continue to do so today. There is documented evidence of this. Such complicity is a fact and I certainly do not think we can take a few general statements disassociating their authors from Osamar bin Laden as evidence of the conversion to peace and respect for human rights of these wings of the international Jihad force present in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Was the United States saved because of its police force or federal intelligence system? It has one, of course. The United States is the most powerful country in the world and this patently did not enable it to predict or prevent the events of Tuesday 11 September and we really cannot see what Europol can do in this matter, other than to strengthen the European Union, which once again is undoubtedly showing that its sole concern is its own power, that it has absolutely no interest whatsoever in the root causes of the problems and that it is only concerned by its return to a position of power.</p>
<p class="contents">If we – who claim to represent all the people of Europe – had to consider one subject, then it should be our failure to take responsibility and that we are responsible for leaving the United States alone to face the rest of the entire world, when our nations have over 1 000 years of diplomatic, historic and military experience…</p>

The scale and nature of the outrage we witnessed in the United States last week gives us a warning of what else the new millennium might bring, so we must look pragmatically at what we need to do together.</p>

Needless to say, our briefing did not go on for very long and we, like so many in the United States, were soon sitting in front of television sets, shocked and silent. That was the mood in America in Tuesday. By Wednesday, people were angry and frightened, understandably, and so were we. Later there was much more thoughtfulness and a more considered response.</p>
<p class="contents">The many messages from the European Union, and indeed from the European Parliament, plus the many personal messages of support and solidarity, were very much appreciated. We were able to fulfil part of our delegation duties, we met members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Congress and had some very useful, although very sad discussions with them. The question they put to us was: How will Europe help us? Will Europe support us? That was really most difficult. It would have been premature and inappropriate for a partial delegation to respond. Of course, we did not know how we should respond. I made a statement to Congress on behalf of the delegation which was lodged in the Congressional Records and I hope with your permission it can be lodged in our own Parliament records as well. This statement stressed, apart, of course, from the natural sympathy that we wanted to express, that this had to be tackled by the United States of America and the European Union and many other countries in partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming ever clearer that the response must be measured and proportionate, and the consequences for all must be anticipated and planned. There is a clear need for major diplomatic and political initiatives to maintain cooperation with those countries nearest to any possible targets or military action and those at most risk from the consequences. We may be facing terrible times ahead but it is essential that we have the courage as well as the compassion to consider carefully the alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my thanks to the many here, including the President, who expressed their concerns for our safety and well-being and particularly to my fellow MEPs, including Mr Belder, Mrs Peijs, my two vice-chairman, the other MEPs, the Parliament staff, Council and Commission staff interpreters and particularly the Commission staff in Washington.

I saw the dismay, horror and despair caused by the attack, and I shared and felt this sorrow and despair. I still feel strongly for the families of those still missing.</p>
<p class="contents">After listening to the debate here, I have put away the script for the speech I had prepared. Instead, I would like to talk about something which has come to me while I have been listening to this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am deeply concerned both about what has happened and about the reaction caused by the events in the US and in Europe. I am convinced that, at the same time as we ourselves feel the horror of this event, there are millions upon millions of people out there in the world who have actually rejoiced in this act of terrorism. I believe that many poor people in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world have rejoiced. We have read about young people in Palestine celebrating this act of violence. I do not believe they were alone in this, but that there are millions and millions of people out there in the world who have reacted in this way. This fills me with incredible horror and fear, as it means that we are facing a world in which there are millions of potential terrorists and perpetrators of similar outrages.</p>
<p class="contents">We must begin to ask ourselves whether we are now witnessing a sort of social warfare. Does this bear any relation to colonial uprisings? From my childhood, I remember the Mau Mau uprising, which was described as a terrorist insurrection. We all remember the Vietnam War, for example. Is it a social war which, in one way or another, lies behind recent events or which is being declared through them? In that case, ideas about mass bombings in the Middle East or about preposterous police checks on a huge scale are meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">Our only chance, in that case, is a huge policy of transformation and redistribution, a policy which removes the desperation and despair in the world which feed and create terrorism. Otherwise, we shall never be safe, despite carpet-bombing and despite all the security services in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, therefore, our first words must be, like those of so many other speakers, words of solidarity and condolence, and we must turn our thoughts to all these lives cut short and to the suffering of their families. Such attacks completely exceed all the bounds of the imaginable and confirm the fears that the fanaticism of terrorist groups will neither give way nor weaken in the face of any considerations of compassion, which makes us fear for the worst for the future if not enough is done to combat or eradicate such fanaticism. The last thing we want to see is a new rift between East and West. We can quite easily distinguish those who freely and peacefully practice the Islamic faith from those who, quite intolerably, take a medieval concept of holy war as the inspiration for attacking citizens, communities and states across the world who simply wish to live in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, respond vigorously to those who are responsible for these appalling acts, which are genuine acts of war against the free world; not only to those who were directly involved in carrying out the acts but also to those who have given shelter to, protected, funded or encouraged these people. In this context, the European Union has enormous responsibilities as a community that acts as a trustee of the universal values of life, freedom, peace and security. Apart from stimulating relationships of trust, cooperation and cultural dialogue with all Islamic communities and citizens that share these universal values, in an attempt to involve them in an active commitment against terrorism and the threat that this represents, the European Union and its Member States must establish, between themselves and internationally, new and more effective forms of cooperation in the field of gathering and processing information by police forces, in harmonising judicial and legal systems and finally, in the field of common security and defence, which will help to guard against and allow the harsh punishment of anyone who encourages this new form of world threat or their agents.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to express our expectation and, I would say, our hope, that today’s debate and the conclusions of next Friday’s European Council will be a decisive step forwards in the long and difficult fight against international terrorism. This is a fight that we must see, now and for as long as the threat lasts, as our utmost priority for European, Atlantic and world-wide security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Germany, the Christian Democratic parties – the CDU and CSU – feel, in any case, that we have obligations towards the Americans in our joint resistance to terrorism, too. American action was decisive in the reconstruction of our country and the recovery of our unity. So we must share with them the burden of combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vitorino's proposals are a first step on this road, and the right one. They are not, however, short-term measures. They will become effective in 2002 at the earliest. Right and proper as they are, we can and must do more. We can, for example, make Europol better equipped than it is at present. Europol urgently needs an agreement with the USA, within the framework of laws currently in force, on the exchange of data in the fight against terrorism. Such arrangements have previously foundered on our making our data protection provisions into the measure of all things. Our protection of data has therefore been of more use to the terrorists than it has to their victims.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make it possible for Europol to become immediately operational. We must at once put in place whatever joint action teams are available. Wherever terrorists are being investigated, Europol must be on the spot and promoting the immediate exchange of data between the investigators and those working in Europol headquarters. These opportunities already exist, and we must seize them. It can be done within the framework of the laws in force and does not require us to wait for the incorporation of directives into national law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorism is, above all, contempt for life, contempt for the life of innocent citizens, sometimes even contempt for one’s own life. If all citizens have a duty to stand in the way of terrorism, it is not sufficient merely to arrest and pass judgment on the perpetrators and organisers of terrorist acts. More than anything, we need to improve the conditions which give rise to terrorism: poverty, underdevelopment and ignorance are fertile ground for all kinds of fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a paradox that any unforeseeable event can easily be explained after it has happened, but it is not sufficient just to explain the world, we have to change it.</p>
<p class="contents">The world economy is in bad shape. After the attack on the United States, it risks getting even worse, particularly if there is prolonged military action. Europe, in order to be able to help others, should tackle its own economic problems. We should welcome the cut in interest rates, and it is also true that the ECB could have better prepared the markets. These measures would have prevented many stock market crashes.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is no balanced growth in the long term, no stabilisation of public deficit, such a shock from the exterior that is unforeseen and unforeseeable should lead Europe to bring automatic stabilisers into play for all EU countries. This is not economic laxity but good economic sense.</p>
<p class="contents">This good economic sense is demonstrated to us by our American friends. They have just decided on a substantial aid package for their civil aviation. Does this mean that Europe will now complain to the WTO about this distortion of competition? Or will she also establish a policy to support those economic sectors weakened by this terrible shock? Luckily, we have the euro. Without the common currency there would have been turmoil on international money markets, pushing certain currencies such as the Deutschmark to the top and others seen as weaker to the bottom, with the breakdown of the internal market into the bargain.</p>
<p class="contents">There is not only Europe, however. There are poor countries that have a greater risk of suffering from any economic turnaround in a recession that is still a possibility. Our main priority should be to aim for the true integration of all countries into world trade. Globalisation, often discredited, only in fact affects a severely limited number of countries. Four fifths of world trade takes place between thirty or so countries. There will be no development without trade. Any economy, in order to be able to export, should create endogenous growth, itself creating greater equity within a country. In order to permit this endogenous development in poor countries, the problem of third world debt needs to be resolved as soon as possible. It is only by eradicating poverty and ignorance that we will definitively defeat terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are standing by the United States not least because the victims of the various attacks include a large number of Europeans, many of them Italians. It was not just the symbols of the economic and collective freedom of the West that were the targets on 11 September: we have all been affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must take the lead in the new political phase which has opened after the recent tragic events. Starting with Parliament, our institutions must play a prominent role in the coming weeks and months. Together with all the countries of the world, the Union will be summoned to the front line, and the decisions we are called upon to make will have to focus on certain major questions including, most importantly, identifying those responsible. This is vital if the United States and the allies who decide to support it are to be able to react against terrorism in the way that they must, but the aim of the action taken must be to strike those responsible for the atrocities in New York and Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to win this war against terrorism, Commissioner, we need a thorough reinvigoration of the secret services sector. In order to do this, in addition to enhancing Europol, which we advocate, it appears increasingly necessary to create a sort of supranational intelligence service. This was discussed at the Summit between the Italian and British prime ministers, a project seeking to create an organisation which can expose and help combat terrorism in all its tentacular ramifications.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy and international action taken must, of necessity, include all the Arab countries. It must be clear that the battle currently being played out is not between the West and Islam: it is between the whole world and the lunacy of terrorism. That is why we attach great importance to Russia and China’s declarations and see the positions of Yasser Arafat and the Israeli government in taking certain decisions which facilitate encouraging steps towards peace in the Middle East as positive.</p>
<p class="contents">A military and intelligence response must, in any case, be accompanied by an incisive Union policy in the areas where there is worst crisis: an action intended to extinguish the flames of desperation and intolerance. The possibility of financial speculation initiated by terrorists on stock markets throughout the world and the crisis experienced by many airlines which will lead to thousands of job cuts demand a raft of measures from the international community to protect the economy as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Europe and all its institutions are called to undergo a great test. However, we are all convinced that people will decide <span class="italic">en masse</span> for what is right and the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance which we all now uphold will ultimately prevail; we are sure that the European Parliament, the institution which represents the people of Europe, will, from Friday onwards, certainly do its part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hume (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there is no doubt that the whole of the European Union stands together with the people of the United States in utterly and totally condemning those who carried out those terrible atrocities in the United States and in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families who lost their loved ones in these terrible atrocities. The European Union and all democratic societies in the world should join together with the United States in seeking to bring to justice those guilty of those atrocities and in doing so, ensure that they target the actual terrorist organisations and their members, not the communities in which they live with the danger of innocent people suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally, terrorism is found in areas of conflict resolution where unfortunately many of those involved believe in what they are doing. The European Union can play a major role in solving conflict resolution in the different parts of the world by sending to those areas of conflict not an army but a philosophy of peace based on firm principles. It is often forgotten, that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Who could have forecast 60 years ago where we all are now? Who would have forecast all this in 1941, with the second world war raging and millions being slaughtered. If our parents and grandparents had said "Don't worry, your grandchildren will be sitting together in a parliament of a United Europe", nobody would have believed them. But it has happened, and how and why it happened is crucial. For that reason the European Union, rather than having an army, should set up a Commission department of peace and reconciliation with a Commissioner of peace and reconciliation to spread this philosophy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in all areas of conflict you have divided peoples. Violence has no role to play in healing the divisions. Dialogue is the first step. Secondly there is the principle of respect for difference because all conflict is about difference, whether of religion, nationality or race. Thirdly, you need to create institutions which respect those differences, and the fourth element is working together in the common interest. Those are the principles at the heart of the European Union that solved the worst conflicts in the history of the world and are the principles that should be at the heart of conflict resolution in any area of conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Admittedly, we have Europol as an institution whose remit covers terrorism among other things, but Europol is powerless if not all Member States comply with the Convention, supply in due time comprehensive information for the analyses required and subsequently make aid available to their fellow Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol is toothless if it has insufficient personnel at its disposal, and at present a mere 12 Europol staff are pursuing inquiries into terrorism in Europe. Europol is also toothless if the technology it needs is not made available to it. A package of measures is therefore urgently required, and quickly. I therefore want the Member States to be exhorted to adhere strictly to the Europol Convention, in particular Article 4, and a mechanism to be introduced to compel the Member States to supply this information.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must provide a budget sufficient to equip a centre of operations with an appropriate number of analysts to engage in investigations into terrorism. Counter-terrorism demands, thirdly, that we set up joint investigatory teams within the framework of collaboration between Europol analysts and representatives of the Member States. We welcome the accelerated initiative of Mr Vitorino's two framework decisions as a new and urgently needed legal basis with which to effectively combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, above all others, has demands made of it. Europe is called, now, to be more than decisive in taking a stand in the face of terrorism and taking action to counter it. Such is the demand of the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The key aim of the new terrorism is to instil fear into us, to throw our world off balance and at the same time to exploit the helplessness of others in simple black-and-white terms. In a nutshell, this is an attack on our world, the whole world, and on our international rule of law, and this is precisely what I should like to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism has become global and also employs, therefore, global, modern technology and international, criminal structures. That is why it requires a worldwide response. For example, a higher level of cooperation among our secret services and the infiltration of terrorist networks spring to mind. We can no longer afford to work at cross purposes as separate states. Instead, we must take joint action and in this new coalition of action, we must go beyond usual concepts.</p>
<p class="contents">International financial consortia and multinational businesses too must cooperate. The production of drugs and oil in regions of conflict and the trade in ‘blood diamonds’ facilitate the financing of illegal activities, of conflict and of war, and are in turn closely linked with the terrorist networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must discontinue the funding of, or cooperation in, the trade in raw materials, where this feeds conflicts and where it provides a breeding ground for terrorism. In this way, we can immobilise the funding of terrorist networks extremely effectively. This new war also requires a continued effort in the exchange of economic and criminal intelligence, even if this means that for reasons of security, some public services become more expensive or slow down.</p>
<p class="contents">Our desire to live in an open democracy that is accessible to everyone makes us vulnerable. But our strength lies in cooperation. This applies overall, irrespective of race, religion or nationality. We can see through every terrorist attempt to divide the world into their world and ours, to antagonise groups or religions. Terrorists are not nourished by religion or ideology. Their hunger is called power. Their weapons are fear and destruction. They do not want peace in the Basque Country, Liberia or the Middle East. They simply want civilian victims. That is why we are on the side of America and of every peace-loving individual who wishes to support this international order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States is dealing with this business calmly and attempting to solve the problem in a multilateral context, including cooperation with NATO. This indicates that all is being done with calm deliberation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, for this reason, we must also make it clear that there is no reason for us to evade our responsibilities and obligations, not simply because of our gratitude and not only in order to guarantee the future of transatlantic relations, but because it is in our most fundamental best interests. Terrorism is taking on the dimensions of a war and resulting in destruction the like of which we knew only in wartime; it is this terrorism that is in a position to strike in the same way at Brussels today, London tomorrow and Madrid the day after tomorrow!</p>
<p class="contents">The combatants are already in our midst, and so nobody can steal away. Nobody, I believe, should look for an alibi, a reason not to join in when the action really does start; and, when it does, it will involve the taking of steps which we must develop on the basis of a new definition of security policy: military action involving the application of all foreign policy instruments, for example the prevention of alliances in favour of the other side, and in conjunction with internal security, about which Mr Vitorino and many in this House have already spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">On this last point, it must be clear that cross-border measures can be put in place against cross-border terrorism and that the best national legislation and the best national police can do nothing without cooperation in this sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally say just one thing: nothing justifies terrorism, but we must still make it our concern to remove the root causes of support for it. We must, therefore, play our part in removing the breeding-grounds for terrorism in the Middle East and in many other regions</p>

We are still overwhelmed by the horrendous pictures, the horrendous truth and their grave consequences now and, we imagine and fear, for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the effect on the economy or on world political relations, however, thousands of people have died, thousands have lost their parents, children, spouses, friends and loved ones. I would like to dedicate my first words to those people who are suffering, to the victims: they, the victims, must be present in our future deliberations and decisions. Because we owe a debt to all of them. We will have to act so that justice is done and in order to prevent, through action or omission, more innocent victims. We know that something has to be done, that there has to be a response, a just, democratic, proportionate response, but a response nevertheless, because terrorists cannot be allowed to have, or believe they have, impunity and because we are obliged to assure the citizens that, living under the rule of law, we have the necessary instruments to defend their life, freedom and security.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot and will not ignore the fact that I am Basque. I would rather have not had this experience in this field, I would do anything not to have had it, but I have. I know that international cooperation is the right approach, that the initiatives presented today by Commissioner Vitorino are the right approach: political cooperation, judicial cooperation, police cooperation. Joint responsibility in dealing with terrorism is our main, most effective, political response.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism – as has already been said – has no borders, no homeland, no religion and no ideology. It has a common objective and method. They have never wanted peace. They have always sought to destroy us, to destroy democracy. I therefore say to them that what the Commission has decided today, what has been approved today, is historic. Allow me to describe it as such. The necessary step has been taken to move on from solidarity, which is necessary but insufficient, to common action by all.</p>

This horrific tragedy requires a response. The citizen asks the government to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of external policy, the European Union is able to do this because we increasingly speak with one voice. The value of our input in the eradication of breeding grounds for terror has increased by leaps and bounds, as will be seen, I hope, in the near future. As regards internal policy, we still cannot manage to speak with one voice. Basically, the ‘every man for himself’ mentality still prevails. Fortunately, the Commission has realised that this is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vitorino, I would like to commend you on the fact that you, and the Commission, have realised that speaking with one voice on behalf of the European Union is absolutely necessary. Within the space of one week, you produced a detailed plan with proposals which are both practical and also truly necessary. This will be rewarded in the form of the citizen’s trust. I hope that none of the Member States will dare to distance themselves from this critical plan, inviting the outrage of its own citizens in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, justice is important in this context, for we are dealing with a crime here, with whatever fine motives it is presented. This is also evident in Northern Ireland where agreements contain terms which are used incorrectly and which are an insult to anyone who takes their religion seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reason to be pleased with the Watson report which provides an initial impulse to the Parliament’s endeavours and may be supplemented with propositions concerning the preparation of crimes which are committed elsewhere, that is, outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that the Commissioner will not accept draft framework decisions which contain weak formulae such as we now see from time to time and which have absolutely no meaning whatsoever. The real added value must lie in the fact that it becomes clear to the citizens that the European Union, as such, takes charge where guaranteeing internal security is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to take steps to prevent similar terrorist attacks again taking place in or from the air. In the immediate future we need increased security for air travellers, preferably at international level. Let us each, though, start with our airports at home. We need stricter checks on luggage and hand luggage. We need tighter checks on airport workers. Above all, it will not be enough for controls at airports to be more stringent today and tomorrow if, in six months' time, they have been relaxed again in certain parts of Europe. No, we need strict controls on a permanent basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at specific cases, there is probably a need for armed flight attendants on certain routes, and we must consider the need to secure the cockpit against terrorist attacks, for we must prevent aircraft becoming the biggest weapons in the world. Although the safety of passengers is our primary concern, our secondary concern is that, at present, the number of passengers carried by airlines is showing a massive decrease. We must keep an eye on this situation. Is the number of passengers falling as a consequence of the terrorist attacks, or because of market conditions or structural factors? As we read in today's newspapers, certain governments are demanding subsidies and yet more subsidies, but these cannot be the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">My group rejects subsidies for airlines. We must give thought to how we can help them. We can do this by coming to an agreement on code sharing and by permitting the restructuring of the companies, along with mergers and<span class="italic"> </span>acquisitions. This would be a more elegant solution, keeping them competitive, but we must not pay out subsidies indiscriminately</p>
<p class="contents">The situation can, of course, change. If the USA supports its airlines to the tune of massive amounts, then we will have to see what effect that has on the transatlantic market. Under such circumstances, we will not be able simply to leave our airlines on the outside looking in, but let us be clear-sighted about this. First of all, however, we need increased security for passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Nazism of the past, the Stalinism of yesterday and the Islamic fundamentalism of today all had and have in common a most profound contempt for human beings, who they intend to subject to their plans for world domination.</p>
<p class="contents">On 11 September, it was not only the freedom but also the dignity of the human being that was attacked in New York and Washington. Those who financed this monstrous attack deliberately sacrificed the lives of their own people with the sole objective of killing the largest number of innocent victims possible, in order to put terror firmly into their opponents’ minds and to rekindle the flame of their supporters’ fanaticism. The resolve shown throughout the world proves that they did not succeed in their main objective, but the subsequent celebrations that took place in various locations show that the second objective could well have been achieved. Faced with this menace, we will naturally be obliged to review our common defence policy, but we should also be working toward the implementation of a new world order that allows Europe, in particular, to be increasingly engaged in the resolution of regional conflicts which, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, and in Africa, do nothing to stem the flow of blood around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to combat fundamentalist terrorism, we should mainly focus our efforts on increased assistance to all supporters of moderate and tolerant Islam, whether they be in power or in opposition. In Afghanistan, for example, we had no idea of how to respond to the urgent request from Commander Massoud to destroy the hornets’ nest that had developed in his country. We should support his partisans in the Northern Alliance, the sole representatives of the recognised government in Afghanistan, and help them in any way we can to overthrow the barbarous Taliban regime. To combat fundamentalist terrorism we need to completely restructure our own defence mechanisms. Europe does not have the means. The American Congress and Senate have just allocated USD 40 billion to the President of the United States. What amount of money, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do you have today to demonstrate, other than through fine words, our desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the American people in this fight that has been forced upon us?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, today everything has changed. I hope that in the adoption of our 2002 draft budget at second reading we will know how to draw the right conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We very much appreciated the support we received from that country in eliminating violence on our own island.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened in New York and Washington is not new. Attacks on economic, political and security targets resulting in major civilian casualties have been the hallmark of international terrorism. They have been experienced in Ireland, Britain, Spain and other European countries: that is why we share and understand the pain of those who have suffered. We in Ireland hope that this atrocity will precipitate a change in the way representatives of organisations responsible for similar atrocities in Ireland are treated as celebrities in parts of the United States. Hopefully, it will also undermine their fund-raising capabilities, particularly when their paramilitary wing still retains the weapons of terrorism and mass destruction and fraternises with other terrorist leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">The major issue facing democratic leaders is how to respond to this latest atrocity. When I listen to the language currently being used by President George W. Bush, I must say I am somewhat apprehensive. To talk about catching 'dead or alive' may well be the language of cowboy movies, but it is not the language that should be used by a world leader at any time, and certainly not during times of crises.</p>
<p class="contents">The revulsion that followed last week's events, provides the impetus to unite everyone in support of democratic ideals in the fight against international terrorism. Handled wrongly however, it could plunge the western world into a conflict with the Islamic world with catastrophic consequences for everyone. Therefore the response must be well thought out and proportionate. It must not result in unnecessary civilian casualties creating another generation of terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a unique opportunity to rid the world of the evil of terrorism and underpin democracy. Future generations will not forgive us if we squander that opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are reassured by the solidarity with the United States expressed by political leaders right across Europe. Previously, the enthusiasm of so many European politicians for European integration has been fuelled by anti-Americanism. There must be no more of this. Seldom has the need for Euro/Atlantic unity been more vital.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that European Union leaders will make sure that there is no backsliding by any European governments when the going starts to get rough. In previous crises, the resolve of some has quickly crumbled. It would be singularly inappropriate to use this crisis to promote and accelerate the integrationist agenda of the Union, in particular the essentially separatist elements of European defence policy. Our motive must be serious action against terrorism, not just seizing an opportunity to extend EU competencies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the internal front, I hope that the proposed European Union common definition of terrorist crime and associated legislation will be sufficiently robust to allow effective action at last to be taken against large numbers of terrorist front organisations throughout Europe. I have to say, I doubt it. The problem is that too many terrorists have their apologists and masquerade in other guises.</p>
<p class="contents">Ways need to be found to prevent terrorist support groups from carrying out what are still regarded as legal acts in our countries, such as recruiting, indoctrinating, broadcasting and fund-raising in order to sustain illegal acts elsewhere. Specifically, it is time for the seven European Union countries which have not yet done so, including the Belgian Presidency, to ratify and implement the UN Convention for the suppression of terrorist financing, so that the black money networks which sustain terrorist organisations can be closed down.</p>

Terrorism is abhorrent, whatever adjectives you use to describe it and whatever ideological label you attach to it. I too feel that we must establish very close cooperation with the United States and form an extensive world-wide alliance of all the countries that wish to be part of it to combat terrorism. The world-wide anti-terrorism alliance must certainly address military issues to ensure safety, but it must also address all the possible forms of terrorism which exist, which range from financial to banking terrorism, and from economic, food contamination and environmental terrorism to electronic terrorism and terrorism in the form of computer hacking.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate between the European Parliament, the OSCE and the WEU, which met at the assembly of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, focused largely, on the one hand, on the need to speed up the process of democratising those countries and, on the other, on the upholding of human rights. These are the two fundamental pillars for eradicating poverty and underdevelopment through the rational use of economic resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Henceforth, the European Union must stipulate the upholding of human rights and the implementation of democracy as firm conditions in all its external relations. This stipulation is fixed and unconditional because it guarantees the protection of the dignity of every citizen in the world. The European Union must encourage respect for every religious faith and, at the same time, it must require all faiths to condemn and abhor terrorist acts, to make a clear distinction between civil society, which is free to practise any religion, and terrorism, which cannot claim to have any religious justification. I support the idea of convening a Mediterranean Forum condemning terrorism, supporting the Middle East Peace Process and reinvigorating the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europol and Eurojust must, together, become effective European tools, concentrating on enhancing the European <span class="italic">corpus juris</span> and thereby creating a basic legal reference framework which will serve as the basis for European civil, penal and administrative law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a former Northern Ireland minister, I have been a terrorist target and I have faced the TV cameras surrounded by the wreckage of a terrorist incident. I know, therefore, how important it is to get both the response right and also to protect the general public as far as is possible in a democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, I am chiefly concerned about aviation and the mostly ordinary people who rely on it. As a member of the Committee on Transport, I have written to the chairman of that committee asking for early consideration of the implications for this important industry. First of all, security at airports and on aircraft; secondly, the control of congested airspace in view of the likely increase in military activity, the dangers of hostile incursion into European civil airspace and, of course, as he said, about the continued viability of European airlines. It is vital that we are consistent in our approach to public safety and to the collective peace of mind throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not overreact, exacerbating the understandable fears of the traveller and threatening their civil liberties, but we must get it right and we must do so immediately. We must act alongside our friends and allies within the United States of America and in international organisations such as the ICAO. To get it right will require work and effort and a commitment: As Mr Van Orden said, we want to make certain that we are saying and doing the same things in six months' time as we profess to do now. In conclusion, the message is quite simple: Terrorism must not be allowed to win. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our most important task is to remind our allies in the United States of the need for caution and considered action, for terrorism is not to be combated through military action. With regard to the proposals tabled by the Commission, I would just say that these do not contain what is necessary to prevent terrorism, whose roots go much deeper. What is proposed is neither necessary nor adequate to stamp out terrorism and does not even begin to pinpoint the fundamental causes, which is what is important.

<p class="contents">Needless to say, the events of last Tuesday were a kind of wake-up call for Europe. As many of you have already stated, it is true that we will need to take decisive action in future in order to remove the inconsistencies between the first, second and third pillars of integration, in other words the second and third pillars within the entire European construction. Some may appreciate in these circumstances that a plea for this does not point to an institutional compulsion, but rather to a concern for the effectiveness of the Union’s actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I have taken a careful note of the invitation which your Member and my friend, Mr Jan-Kees Wiebenga, addressed to me. I would like to tell him to go ahead straight away with the good work by convincing his own political party and his own government to abolish any veto with regard to the Third Pillar. That would be a huge step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as our cooperation with the United States is concerned, I have, on behalf of the Council, said that this must be stepped up and will need to go beyond the usual forms of cooperation. Together with many of you, I hope that the American request for aid from Europe, as repeated by various Members here today, will remain just as clear in future and that provision will be made for a balanced cooperation, by means of which we, on an equal footing, inform, support and help each other as much as possible in all the actions which are necessary to combat international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As some of you have already stated, I would, on behalf of the Council, like to underline that it would be a terrible mistake to view the events of the past week as a kind of conflict between two civilisations, or worse, a conflict between philosophical-religious world visions. Radicalism is nobody’s monopoly, unfortunately, and neither is fanaticism.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened last week is so horrific on account of its sheer scale and the large number of victims involved. Those images will be etched in our minds forever, but unfortunately, every day, we are once again faced with expressions of blind fanaticism, much closer to home, which cannot be ascribed – as happens – to certain world visions. I would like to warn against this most emphatically. We must not go in that direction and we must, on the contrary, ensure that all sources of conflict on our own continent, but also elsewhere, are brought within peace processes as soon as possible. Like many of you, I have the Middle East in mind but not only the Middle East. I am also thinking of the Balkans – yesterday, in Parliament, a conference was held on the Stability Pact relating to the Balkans – and Africa – I talked this afternoon abut the programme of our Presidency concerning Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">As I already stated in my first speech, the European Union is growing into a global power quicker than many had envisaged and slower than many would wish. That brings with it additional weighty responsibilities. I hope that in the next couple of weeks and months, we will prove worthy of those additional weighty responsibilities.</p>

I shall certainly convey to President Prodi and to my colleague Christopher Patten the questions for which they are directly responsible within the Commission. For my part, I should simply like to emphasise three points. The first is to say that I fully share the idea that the strategy on terrorism should not be caught between the various pillars of the European Union. There must be a global strategy that harnesses various instruments, such as conflict prevention policy, of course, the development of a political dialogue with the most problematic regions under the common foreign and security policy, of course, development aid policy, of course, but also, and let us be quite clear on this point, security policy and police and judicial cooperation policy. We cannot ignore the deep-rooted causes of terrorism, but we cannot allow the slightest ambiguity to remain and we therefore state that no cause justifies the use of terrorism and violence that sacrifices innocent lives. The best way of combating terrorism in the name of democratic values, therefore, consists of using the weapons of the law, cooperation between police forces and cooperation between the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth emphasising, however, that there are clearly some issues which we must look into, such as the funding of terrorism, the need to rigorously apply the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the need to adopt effective mechanisms to combat money laundering and the tax havens that provide financial support for terrorist groups and the United Nations Convention on arms trafficking. In other words, we need to implement the Palermo Convention on organised crime. These are many ways of proving, within the framework of the United Nations, that the people who died on 11 September did not die in vain. In other words, that States have learned the lesson and that they are willing to give incontrovertible proof that they are improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that I wish to address concerns aviation safety. I am pleased to say that the Council of Ministers for Transport has decided that a working group will present an initial report on 15 October, not only on the most immediate safety measures that are being taken in airports and in aircraft but also on the need to conclude an agreement, especially with our American partners, on rapidly defining measures to improve the safety of air transport. I also wish to say that these issues will be discussed by representatives of the European Union at the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which opens on 25 September.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to political decisions – for example, the two framework decisions that the Commission has just approved – it is quite clear that unanimity could prove to be a tricky obstacle to overcome in Council. The Commission has already, on several occasions, expressed its sympathy with the idea that methods of decision-making under the third pillar should be streamlined and simplified. However, over and above the issue of unanimity, the Commission’s political position on the fight against terrorism is clear: no State must block decisions. Nevertheless, no State can opt out of the fight against terrorism. The effectiveness of the framework decisions also depends on their being implemented uniformly in all the States of the Union without exception, because we do not want a single haven for terrorist or criminal activities to exist within the European Union. To this end, I hope that the appeals of this Parliament and of public opinion are sufficiently strong to enable us to reach the compromise formulas necessary to improve police and judicial cooperation, which are the legitimate methods for combating terrorism in a democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
