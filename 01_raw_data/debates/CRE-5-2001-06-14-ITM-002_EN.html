<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martínez Martínez (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the two reports that I am presenting affect seven regulations, the reform of which we are debating, and which refer to the outermost regions of the European Union, that is, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Réunion and Guyana, part of France, the Azores and Madeira, part of Portugal; and the Canary Islands, part of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Distance, internal dispersion and climate have been significant obstacles to their development. Distance and transport costs for imports and exports, and the small size of these territories have prevented them from attracting and benefiting from significant investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Declaring its duty of Community solidarity in responding to the needs of these outermost regions, between 1989 and 1991 the European Community adopted some other action programmes due to their remote and island nature, called the POSEIs. The aim was to promote sustainable development and strengthen job-creating production sectors. This was done using the Structural Funds and by favourably adjusting common policies, particularly the CAP. Special aid was thus established for particular local products and the supply of raw materials was improved through specific supply arrangements included in the respective POSEIs.</p>
<p class="contents">The favourable measures established by the Community have been combined with very significant efforts on the part of the Member States directly concerned: France, Portugal and Spain, and by the regional and local administrations. Considerable progress has therefore been made, but despite this, there are still inadequacies, which is why we need to maintain the measures, even improving the mechanisms to seek even more positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, in order to continue to make progress in integrating these regions into the European area and in order to deal with phenomena that have appeared recently with the growing process of globalisation, we need to have a sounder legal basis and strengthen the regulations that have been operating up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been working on this for months, also relying on the fact that in Amsterdam, the recognition of the specific nature of the outermost regions and the commitment to support them in order to overcome their problems was introduced into the Treaties in Article 299. The reform plan that was presented to us was moving in the right direction, but it fell short in its proposals. For example, it did not propose the essential change to the legal basis in order to refer to the new text of the Treaties that I have just mentioned, but it was certainly a good starting point for our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to work on. The committee had better cooperation from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the latter in order to bring about the change in the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We also listened to the authorities and social sectors of the territories that we are dealing with and we thus arrived at a series of amendments that were debated and adopted in the committee proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the amendment on updating the legal basis, there are amendments that respond to joint demands from the different regions and others that are specific to each of them. Among the joint ones it is worth mentioning the possibility of these regions being able to export products produced with raw materials introduced to the islands under the SSAs with rights to refunds, the need to increase support for the livestock breeding sector and to boost agricultural and food SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments on specific sensitive products from each region concern tomatoes in the Canary Islands, livestock, milk products and the sugar industry in the Azores and the wicker industry in Madeira, and support for rice in some of the French territories.</p>
<p class="contents">With these amendments we are expressing our will to overcome once and for all the problems of our outermost regions. They are not about subsidising economic and social backwardness in these territories, but about acting decisively to permanently overcome this backwardness and thus to offer those who live there living conditions and prospects for the future that are comparable to those of the rest of the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the costs of the improvements that we are proposing are certainly insignificant in the context of the budgetary proportions that the Union deals with.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish by thanking the officials of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their dedication and professional attitude, and also by expressing my thanks to the Commission and the Council, who have supported us by showing interest and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as I hope, Parliament adopts what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is submitting for its opinion, it will be the Council of the Union that will have the responsibility of not disappointing our expectations, which are in fact those of the people of the Canary Islands, Madeira, the Azores, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion and Guyana.</p>
<p class="contents">Please bear in mind that it is in measures such as this that the confidence of citizens in the activity of the European Union is at stake, as is, in short, the credibility of our project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty acknowledged the specific nature of these regions, and also defined them according to both their handicaps and the difficulties they face, which are due to their remoteness, their insularity, often because of their difficult topography and climate, and even occasionally their economic dependence. Since the Treaty was signed, it has enabled the policies affected to be legitimately adjusted whilst safeguarding the coherence of the Community legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fisheries sector, three Member States are affected; Spain, Portugal and France. Seven regions are also affected and these are the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Réunion. Many special measures are therefore permitted, namely, the Structural Funds, for both fishing and regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This adjustment has, of course, been approved in the report that I am presenting. Some amendments have also been tabled, which I would like to take you through briefly. I tabled one in particular, which was adopted by the Committee on Fisheries. This is Amendment No 5, which concerns the FIFG intervention level, the financial instrument, in the ultra peripheral regions, which is very important for those involved, in other words, the fishermen. The Commission is proposing to increase the Community contribution for these regions, which is a positive step, up to a maximum of 85%, with the exception of fleet renewal and modernisation of fishing vessels and pilot projects, where the contributions remain exactly the same as in the previous regulation and are therefore unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">My amendment and the amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries are therefore based on this ‘exception’. Basing its argument on the current state of stocks and the need to protect them, as well as the obligation to maintain equivalent fleet capacity, the Commission is proposing that neither should the rate of Community assistance be raised nor the rate of private self-financing reduced for fleet renewal and modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This position does not appear to point in the right direction and does not fulfil the Treaty objectives designed to help the economies of the ultra peripheral regions catch up with the remainder of the EU. We should, therefore, and this is what is being proposed to you, adjust the rates in Group 2. This would have a positive impact on the development of inshore fishing and the improved processing of catches and would also meet the expectations of those working in the sector. Moreover, even though there may be over-capacity in more central areas, this is not the case in all the ultra peripheral regions, or at any rate, it is much less certain.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Parliament has stressed the need to improve safety on board vessels. Vessel renewal and modernisation in the ultra peripheral regions is a key element in providing fishermen with proper working conditions. This amendment proposes, therefore, to increase the A rate or the proportion of the European Union to 50% and the C rate or the proportion of other national or regional contributions to 40%. In my view, this amendment to the report is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second amendment, Amendment No 6 by Mrs McKenna, which does not present any problems. It states in the report that these adjustments and changes must not be used to maintain the system of flags of convenience; we must, therefore, include a sentence in this report which refers to some kind of legal precautionary principle in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there are Amendments Nos 7 and 8, which raise the issue of<span class="bold"> </span>non-retroactivity. This issue was raised at the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries. The Commission was, moreover, not very specific, and was even hesitant, not to mention the fact that it did not provide an answer in its reply. The amendment is still on the agenda, since it was re-tabled. The opinions of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the<span class="bold"> </span>Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are positive. At the beginning, the Committee on Fisheries did not deliver a favourable opinion, at least not wholly favourable, and took the view that this principle of non-retroactivity was a fundamental principle of Community legislation. Given that the two other committees delivered a favourable opinion, however, and that the European Commission was not very specific, I propose to deliver a favourable opinion. If this turns out to be absolutely impossible from a legal perspective, the law will settle the affair. If it is possible, we must do so, and if we do, we will have voted in favour of a very good cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will also be aware that the negotiations went on for an extraordinarily long time, 15 months, which placed the Community fleet in a truly unprecedented position, stopping activity for a period that had not been foreseen by Community legislation. Article 16 of the FIFG Regulation, in letter b) of Paragraph 1, allows the temporary inactivity of vessels to be funded if a fisheries agreement is not renewed for 6 months, which may be extended for 6 more months, following the presentation of a conversion plan. This period and the extension period ended on 31 December, while we were still in the middle of negotiations with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission realised then that shipowners and crews could not be left unprotected while the negotiations continued, which is why the proposal for a Regulation that is being voted on today was presented in order to change the legal basis of the FIFG Regulation with two objectives: on the one hand, enabling the aid to be extended for 6 more months, until 30 June, and on the other hand, authorising the Member States concerned to exceed the threshold of 4% of the FIFG budget that they may use for aid due to the inactivity of the fleet. The period had, obviously due to the extraordinary nature of the situation, had already been long exceeded. It was therefore a totally reasonable proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when the report that we are debating was practically finished, the Council of Ministers in April considered the negotiations to be completed, and in May the Commission had still not presented its proposal for measures that would consider the conversion plan. We know that the Commission intends to put forward a proposal for a Regulation in this respect at the next Council of Fisheries Ministers on 18 June, but for technical reasons it will not be able to be adopted until 3 July, which will cause a considerable delay in the timetable, given that consultation by the European Parliament is also provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">The shipowners will also have to be able to closely consider the options available to them, according to the type of vessel that they have, as choosing between scrapping their vessel, locating it in another fishing ground or forming a joint venture with a foreign partner are business decisions that cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the workers concerned will probably have to wait even longer, as they will be dependent on the decisions of their companies in order to know, for example, whether they are going to leave a fishing ground in order to fish in another or if they are simply going to be unemployed, in which case the formula chosen will be scrapping. It is obvious that these decisions cannot be taken before 30 June, when the formulae that will ultimately be offered to them are still not known now.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, before this report was voted on in committee, I introduced an amendment to change the dates of the Commission proposal and put them back from 30 June to 31 December. The Committee on Fisheries understood the situation perfectly and, also taking into account that extending the period does not carry financial consequences for the Community budget, as the aid will continue to come from the FIFG of the Member States concerned, it decided to unanimously support the amended content of the report.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />I therefore hope that in the light of the reasons that I have given and following the unquestionable support of the Committee on Fisheries, this plenary will be able to also adopt the text that is being voted on today.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I would not like to finish without being able to congratulate the two rapporteurs and especially, from my point of view, for the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Poignant, and I assure him that our group will support his report. I would like to highlight Amendment No 5 to that report, because I think that it fits in much better with Article 29, Paragraph 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, which allows a maximum contribution of 50% to SMEs in the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that measures to modernise vessels tend to be what makes the difference between a competitive business and a business in difficulties, as well as ensuring that its workers have a more decent employment. Precisely for this reason, they should be the last public investments that should disappear or stop being well provided for financially. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out once again that the majority of the outermost regions, which include the group of islands from which I come, the Canary Islands, are islands and are remote from the Community area and from sources of supply to the international markets of essential products for consumption and processing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that, from a political point of view, these proposals, although they come late, come at an interesting time, due to the new context in which we find ourselves as part of globalisation, expansion and new agricultural agreements with third countries. They recognise positive aspects, such as regional diversity and the individual socio-economic and geographical characteristics of the outermost regions. They aim to fulfil the objective of economic and social cohesion, they are balanced for each and every one of the regions affected and implicitly recognise the rights of the citizens of the European Union within the financial neutrality recommended by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In some cases we have incorporated significant changes, such as the inclusion of Canarian tomatoes in the assistance under the agricultural POSEICAN programme, and the review of some products initially included in the SSA (Specific Supply Arrangements), and improvements in aid for the agricultural and livestock sectors of the French Overseas Departments, Madeira and the Azores. All these things are aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the outermost regions, their businesses and employment, and at respect for the environment and recognising the strategic nature of the agricultural sector. And most importantly, at European integration, so that from now on we will be able to talk about the remote dimension of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons we congratulate the rapporteurs on their work, in particular Mr Martínez Martínez for his receptiveness, and we ask the Members and all the parliamentary groups to support these reports. It will undoubtedly bring about a greater sense of European integration for the citizens concerned, and in our case, when we go back to the Islands we will be able to say ‘mission accomplished.’</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must thank the authorities of the regional governments and of the Member States concerned: France, Spain and Portugal, as well as the Commission and the Swedish Presidency, for their interest in moving forward this package of regulations for the outermost regions, which are an example of solidarity between the peoples of the European Union. I would also like to say on a personal level that I will not vote on the regulations referred to in Mr Martínez Martínez’s report that affect the Canary Islands, as I have agricultural interests on the Islands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Distant as they are from the major markets, their normally small-scale agriculture is a mainstay of their economies and would be unable to survive without support in an increasingly globalised market. The Commission proposal, however, errs on the side of meagreness, confining itself most of the time to prolonging the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, without addressing new market trends and the increasing difficulty for these regions to compete on international markets ever since the World Trade Organisation agreement was signed in 1999. Despite this situation and the insufficiency of the Commission proposal, I should like to lay great emphasis on the role played by the rapporteur, Mr Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez, who managed to work with all those involved in an atmosphere in which good dialogue could lead to compromise solutions, with a result that clearly improves on the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I should like to highlight some of the changes taken up by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development concerning the regions that I know best, the Azores and Madeira. For instance: the eligibility of traditional varieties for the purposes of vineyard restructuring, including premiums for the grubbing-up of those varieties; maintenance of the supplement to the special premium for the fattening of bovine animals, so as to encourage farmers who have no more milk quota to change over to beef and ensure that the added value of fattening does not leave the region in the form of very young cattle for export; the flexibility of granting aid for the marketing of plants and flowers without the need to draw up annual contracts with producers’ organisations, which would be impossible in view of the inadequate organisation of agriculture in these regions; the extension of aid to the marketing of potatoes for human consumption; the increase in production rights and premiums for strategic productions, such as suckler cows, bovine animals for fattening, or sugar beet; improvement of the special supply arrangement with the inclusion of certain raw materials essential for the competitiveness of the compound feedingstuff production sector and consequently for the livestock sector. In conclusion, Parliament has done its job, having made a real effort to hold a dialogue both among Members themselves and between Members and those politically responsible for the outermost regions of the European Union. We now hope that the Council will also do its job by accepting the measures approved by the Committee on Agriculture and this Parliament. In accordance with this analysis, the European People’s Party will vote in favour of this proposal, and I should like once again on behalf of my group to express our deepest thanks to the rapporteur for the great diligence and openness with which he drew up this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I welcome today’s debate and the structural and agricultural packages proposed by the Commission, because they undeniably seek to take better account of the realities of the overseas territories. I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs and particularly Mr Martínez Martínez and Mr Poignant on their excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the Commission’s proposals can be considered as a step in the right direction and they are a satisfactory response to local needs. First of all, on the structural measures, we can only welcome the alignment of intervention levels to 85% for all outermost regions. In practice, this means that we are giving the same opportunities to people who have to deal with basically identical constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">On the agricultural measures, since I am from Réunion, I welcome the measures to assist traditional farming and, in particular, transport aid for sugar cane, which our farmers have long been waiting for. I have a few comments, however, to make with regard to some of the points. First of all, I deplore the fact that the retroactivity of the measures has not been explicitly worded and I welcome the fact that many of Parliament’s amendments forcefully emphasise the importance of this point for all types of farming, as we must think of the thousands of farmers who are waiting for these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I am sorry that the Commission did not automatically retain Article 299(2) as a legal basis, which, in my view, runs absolutely counter to the spirit advocated by the Heads of State and Government. I therefore welcome the fact that this omission was partially restored by the Council, because by limiting the scope of this article, we are undermining the very concept of what outermost regions are.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to end with a wish. I would like the reforms that have been proposed here to lay solid foundations for an even more ambitious policy for our regions, so that equal opportunities and the acceptance of differences become a reality for all the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In committee we tabled an amendment on the increasing problem of fishing vessels flying flags of convenience, which was very narrowly defeated. More and more unscrupulous shipowners are transferring their vessels to countries such as Belize, Honduras or St Vincent and the Grenadines. They know perfectly well that these countries will turn a blind eye to whatever these ships do: how they fish and what they catch. Commissioner Fischler has quite rightly referred to this problem as the 'scourge of the oceans'.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there is nothing to prevent a European shipowner from exporting his ship to one of these countries, receiving a very healthy subsidy of EUR 1 million or more and still keeping his ship. We introduced an amendment to try and close this huge loophole, using criteria adopted by international fisheries management organisations. I am glad to hear that the rapporteur supports our amendment, because it is scandalous that this loophole still exists.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not see how anyone in this House could actually support the use of EU funds – EU taxpayers' money, that is – to allow shipowners to escape controls and then fish in competition with law-abiding shipowners. I urge everyone here today to support this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, based on Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which recognises the specific character of these regions and the need to adopt appropriate Community measures, it is possible to take measures aimed at encouraging sustainable development and enhancing the productive sectors that generate employment. It is therefore important to use this legal base, regardless of any reference to articles of the CAP, the Structural Funds or other Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the context in which we must analyse the Commission’s proposals, which may be positive but fall far short of the needs of these outermost regions, as I have been able to confirm directly with bodies in Madeira and the Azores. Hence the importance of the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Martínez Martínez, whom I congratulate on the report he has drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the report responds to the questions that the Commission has not addressed sufficiently but which are important for those regions. With regard to the first package of proposals, which aims at revision in the sense of increasing the rates of assistance under the Structural Funds, it is important to make a greater effort by slightly increasing the Community co-funding percentages, particularly as regards agri-environmental measures and public aid to the productive sector, given that these regions are among the poorest in the European Union and their production, processing and marketing structures need to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the second package of proposals, which aims at reviewing the machinery for aid to agricultural production in these regions, so that support for agriculture may have a positive effect on farmers’ incomes and on lower prices for the consumer, the almost one hundred proposals contained in the report are important. Those that deserve special mention, for their importance to the Portuguese outermost regions of the Azores and Madeira, are the need to strengthen the specific support for the restructuring of vineyards and vine growing, potato production and marketing, the livestock sector, not forgetting the matter of milk quotas, and the measures for ensuring the viability of sugar refining in the Azores, as well as increased support for tea, in addition to specific changes for Madeira wines and support for wicker production.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Commission and the Council will accept the proposals contained in the reports being debated jointly, also including the area of fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the collapse of negotiations with Morocco, which behaved in an incomprehensible way, it looks as if a portion of the fishing fleet will have to be rationalised.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Green Paper, the Commission announced that approximately forty per cent of the European fishing fleet will have to be scrapped if we still want to catch fish in European waters in ten to twenty years’ time. Rapporteur Poignant opposes the notion that peripheral regions should also give up fleet capacity. Although I can fully understand his concern for the working population, such concern is short-sighted. In the future we cannot continue supplementing poor catches with contributions from the Structural Fund. One way or another fleet capacity must be reduced. As regards that reduction of the fleet I should like suggest an idea to Mr Poignant : that is, days at sea. The Dutch fleet has a capacity that is nominally too large for the allotted fishing area. However, by restricting the number of days that ships may be at sea, the impact of total fleet capacity on fish stocks is reduced. In this way the capacity of the fleet at sea on a particular day is within the norms laid down. Such a scheme makes it possible to modernise and improve the safety level of the fleet.

Although it makes some good proposals, such as the increase in government funding for investment in agricultural holdings, this report comes up against some sizeable obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the WTO and its declared ambition to reduce subsidies and direct funding for farming. We would thus sacrifice bananas from the West Indies and the ACP countries, in order to please the American multinationals, with the introduction of a solely tariff-based system in 2006. The second obstacle is the enlargement of the European Union, which will deprive the overseas territories of a proportion of the Structural Funds. The third obstacle is the bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that undermine the principle of Community preference and the fourth obstacle is tax harmonisation, which endangers dock dues<span class="bold"> </span>and the advantages associated with the remoteness of these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are measures, however, for saving agricultural crops in the overseas territories, which are not mentioned in the report. These include bringing back Community preference, the strict application of safeguard clauses, favouring high-quality produce through designations of origin, guaranteeing tax advantages associated with the insular nature and remoteness of these regions, the application of export refunds for processed products and the checking of imported goods to avoid fraud and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Only at this price and under these conditions are we able to protect our traditional tropical products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increasing the existing ceilings for the contribution<span class="bold"> </span>of some Community funding is, therefore, a positive step. On the other hand, some of the restrictions introduced by the Commission must be removed. It is, therefore, imperative that the increase of the FIFG level be applied to shipbuilding activities, which are essential. In the same way, in the field of co-financing, it is crucial not to impose the same strict rules on the outermost regions as on the continental territory of the European Union. The effect of these provisions is extremely disadvantageous, particularly for the communities of the overseas territories on account of their recurrent budgetary difficulties. Although the rule of co-financing can be retained, it certainly must be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to be all the more necessary to make these rules more flexible because the threats to the economic systems of the outermost regions and to the overseas territories are multiplying. Some types of funding can be threatened overnight, as in the case of the banana crisis with the United States. With the regional integration of the Caribbean islands into the Americas’ free trade area looming in 2005, the overseas territories will have to contend with unfair competition from their neighbours. Mr Lamy’s ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative will destabilise rice, sugar and banana production. Since this provision is non-reciprocal, it will lead to unfairness. The overseas territories will therefore have to import<span class="bold"> </span>goods duty-free from the neighbouring LDCs, whereas the reverse will not be possible. The LDC countries in the Caribbean will be able to ban European exports from the overseas territories using the negative list system. It is therefore essential that structural aid granted to the outermost regions, even if not in itself sufficient, should benefit from special rules in order to allow European countries to make up, at least partially, for their structural handicap and the threats that they will face in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs, including those who are not part of the Committee on Fisheries, such as Mr Martínez Martínez, to whom I extend the congratulations, but I would like to focus, as is logical, on those who belong to our committee, Mr Poignant and Mrs Fraga, for the great skill of the work that they have presented to this Parliamentary sitting and for the strong support that they have achieved in our Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the report by my colleague Mr Poignant, we must welcome the inclusion of Article 299, item 2, of the Treaty as a legal basis and as an essential starting point for a new concept of the true dimension of the concept of outermost regions and for adjusting the ceilings for assistance. Our committee recently visited the island of Réunion on the initiative of our colleague Margie Sudre and I think that we all came back convinced of the need to help with generous solidarity to solve or at least to alleviate the specific and difficult problems that these very remote European territories have.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the report by our colleague Mrs Fraga, we should also thank our committee for its unanimous solidarity in supporting the initiative to extend assistance to 31 December of this year for a specific sector that is so affected by the failure to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco. The timetable for the European Union to approve a specific plan for those affected by this lack of agreement means that this extension is needed as a margin in order to carry out the plan without worsening the already very heavy impact that there has been.</p>
<p class="contents">I only hope that both the Commission and the Council will take note of the unanimous position of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are difficult times for fisheries and here today, as proof of this, we are debating the extension of FIFG aid for the fleet that was fishing on the Canaries and Saharan Bank until a conversion plan is implemented, as the rapporteur of this report, Mrs Fraga Estévez, has explained to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The European media are already saying that the Commission plans to allocate EUR 142 million, charged to the flexibility instrument, to this plan, but I, like the sector itself, have too many doubts about this, which I would like Mr Fischler to clear up for me.</p>
<p class="contents">Does using the flexibility instrument not limit aid to just one budgetary year, while the proposal from the Spanish government, which was for multi-annual assistance, would be much more appropriate for dealing with these people who have been removed from the fishing ground where they habitually fished?</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish government justified its plan and quantified it at EUR 540 million, 240 from the FIFG and 300 of additional funding. Can the Commissioner explain to me why this is not being done?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as you were at the Council meeting in Nice, could you explain to me whether what was agreed there on the conversion plan for this fleet included aid for the economic regeneration of the areas affected or whether it was purely limited to aid for scrapping, aid for shipowners and fishermen?</p>
<p class="contents">The sector affected, which is a large sector, has more questions than answers about its future. What is going to happen, for example, with the FIFG Regulation, which establishes that the aid that shipowners receive for temporary inactivity cannot be combined with subsidies for scrapping and that therefore, if they want subsidies for scrapping, they are going to have to return the aid for inactivity that they have already received? The sector wants to know whether this conversion plan for the fleet is going to be debated at the Council of Ministers on 18 June, whether the aid is going to be extended equally, as this report proposes, to shipowners and workers, or if it is only going to be for the latter, whether you have received the conversion plans from the governments concerned, the Spanish and Portuguese governments, and when are you, Commissioner, going to present your proposal to the European Parliament and the Council?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the Commission plan, whether funds are going to be included for the economic diversification of the areas, because in my opinion, simply redistributing and redirecting FIFG funds already allocated to the Member States, Commissioner, is taking from one mouth to feed another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if the Commission has not yet addressed all of the requests made by the Member States, these new proposals are particularly important and open up the way to greater changes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the structural measures, we can take satisfaction from the fact that the Commission is proposing to raise Structural Fund assistance rates and the public subsidy limit for the outermost regions, even though the aim is really to enable these regions to regain funding levels close to those in force in the previous programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am sorry that the increase in these rates only target closed investment categories. The consequence of this will be to impose a major limit on the scope of the measure and, ultimately, to prevent the outermost regions from matching their situation in the 1994-1999 period.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the revision of the agricultural chapters that have been submitted, we should emphasise that this is part of a very limited budgetary context, which is having a very powerful effect on the content of the measures and their scope. I must remind you that the total appropriations for the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the overseas departments (POSEIDOMs) have been reduced by 25%, falling from EUR 46 million to EUR 35 million in the 2001 budget, whereas the financial forecasts for funding the reform stated that the financial requirement for 2001 was EUR 55 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into detail on the proposals, which are, on the whole, a step in the right direction, it is crucial that Article 299(2) should be kept as the legal base for this text and that the continuity of these measures is guaranteed in order to compensate for the delay by the Commission in drafting them and to prevent any interruptions to funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the proposal for a regulation on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), the special rates for fleet renewal and modernisation measures must be applied to ships of up to 16 metres in length. This is a fundamental issue for fishing in Réunion. I would ask you to support these proposals and the two amendments that I have re-tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Approval of this package of regulations adapting the rates of Community co-funding in the Structural Funds together with the revision of the POSEI programmes closes a cycle in the field of agricultural and structural legislation for the outermost regions. From the viewpoint of the Azores, I see this body of regulations as positive and it will allow this region to continue approaching European standards of development. I also congratulate the rapporteur Carmen Fraga Estévez on her report. It is necessary to extend and develop support for the fishermen and fisheries affected by the non-renewal of the agreement with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I want to raise again the most serious problem in the debate on the economy of the Azores, which also affects the economy of Madeira: the massive collapse in the numbers of tuna migrating from equatorial Atlantic waters to these Macaronesian archipelagos. This is a direct consequence of the increase in fishing effort particularly by dozens of purse seine vessels whose activities are encouraged by the European Commission in West African waters, where the tuna begin their migration to Macaronesian waters. The European Commission must immediately asses the effects of its policy, both in the West African waters where it is directly applied, and in the fishing communities of the Azores and Madeira and the tuna processing industry in the Azores where its consequences are felt. It must reverse its policy of supporting overfishing and industrial and predatory fishing methods to uphold sustainable fishing and support the fishing communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the three versions for the regions and departments of France, Spain and Portugal, the POSEI were designed and implemented as an expression of the political will of the Council and the Commission to stimulate the development of these regions, which are among the most disadvantaged in the Union due to their remote and island nature. With the inclusion of the new Article 299.2 of the Treaty, the outermost regions now have a sound legal basis that has enabled the Commission to propose these new POSEIs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the budgetary context defined by the stability agreement reached in order to allow Economic and Monetary Union, the financial statement proposed by the Commission complies strictly with the criteria of budgetary neutrality. I must say that practically all of the additional spending is compensated for by the savings as a result of the reform of Agenda 2000. Despite all this, the Commission’s proposals respond to their desire to fulfil the commitments that have been gradually made over recent years, as is the case with cattle and milk production in the Azores or the inclusion of tomato production in the Canary Islands, to name just two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still, of course, a few aspects left to resolve, such as the case of some products, especially in the agriculture and food processing industry, within the specific supply arrangements for the Canary Islands, which will have to be resolved as part of the decisions to be made in the Management Committee responsible, given that if the conditions envisaged at the moment were maintained, the result would be unsatisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate you and thank you for the Commission’s interest in the outermost regions and express the general satisfaction of the Members of this House. I would also like to thank Mr Martínez Martínez and congratulate him on his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, I want to point out three or four amendments to Mr Fischler that are of particular importance. I am referring to Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92, concerning specific measures for the Canary Islands and, specifically to Amendments Nos 29 and 34, aimed at including aid for non-municipal public forests, and Amendment No 158, also concerning aid for non-municipal forests. I think that the Spanish authorities were mistaken in not requesting this aid at the time and now they must do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also referring to Amendments Nos 126 and 127, which aim to protect local industry in the Canary Islands and, finally, the amendments aimed at protecting the Canarian tomato, which could encounter serious difficulties in the new phase of drawing up a Community policy that applies in Mediterranean countries. Also the proposed measures to support wine but to remove aid for imports to the Canary Islands of table wine and liquid milk, which could enter into competition with Canarian products.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I think that we have a good proposal from the Commission and some good reports by Mr Martínez Martínez. The European Parliament should adopt these proposals, which, incidentally, have not been amended at all in Parliament, as I think that the majority of Members consider that the text adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a positive one.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, may I start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Martínez Martínez, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their detailed and constructive reports on the complex subject of outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to quote a few statistics on the disadvantages of these regions. Six out of seven of the outermost regions have an average per capita income of between 40 and 55% of the European average and are hence among the lowest in the Union. The unemployment rates in five of these regions are among the highest in the European Union at between 21 and 37% of the working population.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal relates to contributions by the Structural Funds. The maximum contribution by the Funds in outermost regions – and this is new – has been set at 85% of overall eligible expenditure. The maximum contribution of the Funds towards investments in small and medium-sized enterprises has been increased from 35 to 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal concerns the regulation on developing the countryside under the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. The ceiling on the EAGGF contribution towards eligible investment costs has been raised from 50 to 75% for investments in farm holdings and from 50 to 65% in the processing and marketing sector. In addition, aid will also be granted for woods and areas belonging to the local, regional and national public sector in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also makes provision to increase certain financial contributions under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance. All the additional expenditure incurred here can be financed from the budget approved for the 2000-2006 planning period.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that Parliament supports the Commission proposals in principle and that we enjoyed such constructive discussion in the various committees. I can agree with many of the proposed amendments, provided that we find the right wording. They include the amendments increasing maximum aid rates to 65% for the entire foodstuffs industry and to 75% for SMEs, on condition that investments for sectors and enterprises comply with certain target specifications, to be decided at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">They also include the amendments increasing agri-environmental measures in the agricultural sector and the three other flanking measures to 85% and doubling the maximum amounts for agri-environmental measures in the sensitive areas of Madeira and the Azores. I also agree that these measures should enter into force with retroactive effect from 1 January 2000. However, the Commission stands its ground on the legal basis. Article 299(2) should only be used for derogations from the Treaties or general legal principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the agricultural part of the POSEI programme. Having evaluated aid regulations on the basis of past programmes, it is clear that previous measures have, by and large, had a positive impact, although there has been repeated criticism on certain points. The Commission's proposals have been drafted in the light of both these evaluations and this criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the most important considerations? First, the present framework for specific supply regimes and specific aid for local agricultural production should be simplified, consolidated and improved. Secondly, the specific supply regimes must be strengthened because their objective, that is, to bring production costs in peripheral regions into line with costs in the rest of the Community, is still valid. Thirdly, the list of products has been revised and a number of feedingstuffs have been included on the list. Fourthly, we want more competition between supply sources, which is why we have introduced the principle whereby aid must reflect the costs of transport from the European mainland. Fifthly and finally, the common organisation of the market in milk and in beef and veal needs to be revised in order to harmonise the three POSEI regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's stand on the proposed amendments is based on the principle of budgetary neutrality, which must be maintained in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, expenditure on the three POSEI programmes can be increased to EUR 204.4 million between now and 2005, with the same breakdown, as this proposal is covered by savings. The Commission can therefore only agree to proposed amendments which impact on the budget if they are offset by equally high savings.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish, if I may, by listing the points on which I can agree. I can agree to a specific supply regime for the French departments for products from all third countries, that is, not just from developing countries and other overseas departments, and to the fixed deadlines for the entry into force of certain articles of POSEIDOM which guarantee continuity and facilitate trade between the Azores and Madeira in products which come under the supply regime. The conversion of vineyards planted with hybrid varieties can be continued in the Azores and Madeira under certain circumstances. Promoting imports of fattening cattle could be included in a comprehensive programme to promote cattle breeding on the Canary Islands. Finally, the transitional regulations should be strengthened in order to guarantee continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, I cannot agree to apply Article 292(2) here.</p>
<p class="contents">Now briefly to the fisheries reports. I shall confine myself here to the proposed amendments; obviously you know what they are because you are about to vote on them. The first two proposed amendments concern the legal basis. As the same legal basis must apply to the whole package of measures, the Commission stands by its proposal to apply Article 37. Article 299 should only be used in order to make provision for derogations from the Treaty, which is not the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept the third proposed amendment. Amendments Nos 4 and 6 concern problems with fish and flags of convenience. These problems were raised during the debate. We are in full agreement with you here and I expressly welcome the fact that Parliament has a clear position on this matter. We would prefer, however, to resolve this problem when we next amend Regulation 27/92, which we are already working on. We shall be sending a proposal to Parliament and the Council within the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the fifth proposed amendment, a broad majority in the Council is in favour of a compromise solution on this question. A compromise would be acceptable to the Commission, because the fleet segment in question comes under the heading ‘small coastal fisheries’ and we want to avoid adverse repercussions, especially as artisanal coastal fisheries do not represent a danger to stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 5, you suggest that action to renew and modernise the fleets in question should be included and that national and Community investment rates should be raised for the entire fleet. We cannot accept your Amendment No 5 because we feel that we should not keep on promoting the overcapitalisation of the EU fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8.</p>
<p class="contents">Then briefly to Mrs Fraga Estévez's report. This proposal is the first in a package of measures ordered by the European Council in Nice. Today's proposal meets one of the specifications set in Nice, namely to extend the current aid regulation to 30 June. The Commission will be adopting the second measure in the package ordered by Nice in June as well. This proposal for a Council regulation will contain a series of derogations from the provisions of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance and will propose specific measures for which additional funds will be earmarked. However, as this proposal will not pass through the Council until the autumn, we can agree to your proposed amendment extending aid to the fishermen and shipowners in question under this proposal until the end of the year. I think this is justified for social reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, despite the noise here, anyone interested in hearing my report and my position has been able to do so. Thank you.</p>

I would like to make it clear that the Quaestors were not consulted about this change. They should have been, and an undertaking was given that they would be before a tender was awarded, but they were not consulted. I have managed to speak only to Mary Banotti so far, but I can assure you that we will take this matter up.</p>
