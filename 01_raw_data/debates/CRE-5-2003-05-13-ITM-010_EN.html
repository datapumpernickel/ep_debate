<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 26 by Paulo Casaca (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0254_EN.html">H-0254/03</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Storm of 11-12 April 2003 in the Azores</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 11 and 12 April 2003, the Portuguese Autonomous Region of the Azores was hit by a severe storm which caused substantial damage to housing and public infrastructures on all the islands of the archipelago, and had a particularly destructive impact on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The author of this question was able to ascertain in person the extent and severity of the damage caused to the various forms of greenhouse cultivation, especially to the pineapple greenhouses on the island of São Miguel. Fruit and vegetable production (above all, bananas, oranges and passion-fruit) is severely affected, and the vineyards have been all but wiped out.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the frequency of such storms in the Azores, the regional programme under the Structural Funds (PRODESA) already provides for specific actions in case of natural disasters. However, there remain two aspects for which further information from the Commission would be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission state whether the impact of this storm will be taken into account in the decisions to be taken on the regional allocation of the programming and efficiency reserves under the Community support framework?</p>
<p class="contents">Can it also state whether, on similar lines to those applied this summer to Central European farmers affected by bad weather conditions, it is considering specific measures for the farmers affected with a view to minimising the adverse effect on their income? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, there have recently been various climatological disasters in different parts of the European Union, but I would like to point out that some of the measures in the regional operative programme of the Structural Funds provides for aid which can alleviate the damage caused by the bad weather conditions referred to by the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the problems suffered on 11 and 12 April in the Azores – which the honourable Member has mentioned – do not in principle allow for the allocation of supplementary sums from the effective reserve. As the honourable Member knows, this is an instrument intended to promote the efficiency of operative programmes. Its allocation is based on indicators defined by the Member State, in agreement with the Commission, which reflect the efficiency, management and financial execution of programmes and allow the results to be measured, in relation to the objective defined by the programme. In other words, they are intended to stimulate the different European regions of the different countries of the European Union to manage the Structural Funds available to them in the best and most efficient way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, by allocating the programming reserve proposed by the Member State at the time of the programming of the Community support programme, the special needs of the agricultural sector in the Azores can be taken into account. This would provide a margin for the reallocation of funds. Portugal can therefore propose that the bad weather conditions referred to by the honourable Member be taken into account, but, I would insist, by means of the programming reserve</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the possibilities of aid to farmers, certain measures may be adopted, at the request of the Member State in question, within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy, although, as the honourable Member knows, the Commission has not so far received any communication or request for intervention from the Member State or the regional authorities in relation to the events in the Azores.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission is consulted in this regard, it will of course study the measures which may be adopted in order to deal with the consequences of this bad weather within the framework of the legislation in force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to say first that it is extremely hard to put into words the things that I witnessed over those few days, because this was a storm made up of incredibly strong cyclonic winds, which caused extremely widespread damage, both to buildings and to fruit trees and forestry in general. Above all, however, because this storm led to an invasion of salt, which covered the entire lower part of all the islands in the Azores.</p>
<p class="contents">This salt completely covered Graciosa, for example, resulting in the chemical destruction of practically everything that lived there. The losses to farming as a whole are enormous, with vines and vegetable crops being totally destroyed. I know, as the Commissioner said, that the regional authorities have not yet sent the Commission a report on this disaster and I know that this report will reach the Commission very soon, but I wanted to note now what has been said about the programming reserve and I also wanted to note the willingness demonstrated by the Commission to adopt measures for the agricultural sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For years now, the area around Gibraltar has been the scene of constant discharges of oil into the sea during the refuelling, loading and unloading of vessels. This has enormous environmental and economic impacts on nearby areas in Spain, since the economic activities there centre fundamentally on fishing and tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just one example of highly polluting substances being discharged, but there are many others. These discharges create eyesores for the public, have major economic repercussions and cause incalculable damage to the environment since they make any kind of normal activity impossible in the contaminated zone for a long time afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of disasters of this type and the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on improving safety at sea in response to the Prestige accident (COM/2002/0681 final), when will the Commission present the assessment of whether current legislative and policy instruments for protecting the environment should be adapted in order to minimise the risk of accidents and the damage associated with them occurring? </p>

All the measures necessary for the establishment of the European Maritime Safety Agency have therefore been adopted: on 29 January its Executive Director was appointed and its activities are already beginning in Brussels, with a provisional headquarters while its final headquarters is decided upon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also begun to establish a Community system for the monitoring of ship traffic, the SafeSeaNet, and has also asked the Member States to define in advance national plans for receiving ships in difficulties in ports or areas of refuge before this summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Two coordination meetings have already been organised in this regard and I would like to point out that the Commission has also, apart from addressing all the neighbouring countries of the Mediterranean Rim, but also Russia and Norway, held talks (it has not only addressed all these countries in writing) to stress the importance for maritime safety of the control of oil tankers by port authorities, but that, also, specifically with Russia, Norway, Algeria and Morocco, we have dealt with these issues in the bilateral meetings with the relevant ministers and, in the specific case of Russia and Norway, we are looking at the possibility of establishing a control system for maritime traffic in the Baltic and the North Sea, which allows us to increase safety and prevent any kind of problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I must add that, on 20 December, the College of Commissioners adopted a Regulation prohibiting the transport of heavy fuel by single-hull oil tankers, to or from European Union ports, and according to which, the replacement of single hull ships with double hull ships is speeded up, a proposal which furthermore has been agreed in the Council and examined at first reading by the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and which therefore should enter into force next June, if the agreements within the Council are maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to point out that, on 5 March, the Commission delivered to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a directive on pollution from ships and the introduction of penalties, including of a criminal nature, for pollution crimes. This proposal relates to illegal, accidental or voluntary dumping – because there is also wilful dumping: the cleaning of hulls and of bilge, which the honourable Member refers to, establishing responsibilities throughout the chain from shipowners, charterers, classification societies, etc which will allow us to resolve the gaps in Community law on deliberate or accidental pollution by ships and which will oblige the Member States to adopt the corresponding legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the FIFG Fund, which we have seen in the case of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, but also in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, which is patently insufficient with its current sum, must be increased to a maximum ceiling of responsibility of a thousand million euros, in accordance with the Commission’s proposals, and in accordance with an agreement in the Council of Ministers, which has agreed that, if this fund is not increased within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation, at least in the European region, a Decision will be adopted at European Union level to establish a supplementary fund which allows these levels of compensation to be achieved. On the 16th of this month there will be a diplomatic conference, within the International Maritime Organisation, and I hope that this proposal of ours will be accepted, that is, simply that the European Union should receive equivalent protection to a country such as the United States for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the questions I would like to ask are: to what extent are the responsibilities in Gibraltar defined, and also, to what extent does the Commission’s Directorate-General for the Environment – and I do not know whether I can receive a reply at this moment – will accept this series of measures so that it may genuinely be a transversal operation of guarantees, which includes environmental responsibility for these problems? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to the cleaning out of bilge for example, we can demand that there should be no dumping at sea because we have approved – and this Parliament supported this proposal – a Directive which obliges all the Member States to establish, in all Union ports of a certain level, the installations necessary for cleaning hulls and bilge in port, so that it is not necessary to clean them at sea, which has been the normal practice a for all these years and which is the cause of more than 90% of oil pollution year after year. Hull pollution is not the result of great disasters such as the Erika, the Prestige, the Amoko Cádiz or the Mar Egeo. These have a terrible effect locally, as we have seen, but furthermore, every year tonnes and tonnes of oil are intentionally dumped at sea causing nine or ten times more pollution than these huge disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Gibraltar, I would like to say to the honourable Member that in the Directive and Regulation adopted, in relation to the requirement on double-hull vessels, the transport of heavy oil, the modernisation of the fleet and other issues, it is stated very clearly: it is applicable in all ports, quays or anchorage areas in the European Union. Gibraltar is in the European Union and is therefore also affected, like any other place – such as Algeciras – to mention the opposite port.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Commissioner responsible for the Environment fully agrees with the measures we have proposed, although we are establishing a specific definition in relation to oil and pollution by hydrocarbons. A specific definition which relates to the fact that the FIFG Fund provides specific and differentiated cover and insurance for pollution by hydrocarbons – which other possible types of potential pollutants lack – and furthermore, in the field of criminal penalties, we also believe that pollution by hydrocarbons or by the cleaning out of bilge has a component which requires a specific type if penalty or which, at least, can require that other types of ecological crime are not treated as such a crime, with criminal penalties in some countries. But in this case, in which there are clearly the wilfulness and serious effects on nearby populations and the marine environment, it is clear that this criminal definition of this type of action, which are entirely unacceptable, is required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All countries which, like Portugal, are fortunate enough to have long coastlines, occasionally experience spills that turn up on beaches with no indication of where they have come from or of who is responsible.

<p class="contents">We are talking about this being a crime within 200 miles, within the exclusive economic zone. As I said before, this is supplemented by increased controls of maritime traffic. I believe – and we are going to begin some studies in this regard – that we are currently carrying out control of maritime traffic in relation to certain types of vessel, specifically oil tankers, and also in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is a matter of going a step further, of controlling all types of ships sailing, apart from traffic close to the coast, within three, four or five miles; that, from a certain distance from the coast, all traffic must be controlled. This would mean greater safety in a sea which is increasingly being used for maritime transport and recreational activities, but also in a sea which is increasingly polluted and which must be protected more thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">What is being done in the sky in relation to aircraft could also be done, with the appropriate modifications and variations, in relation to the sea, and that is what we are working on, beginning – I would insist – with the control of the oil tanker traffic entering European Union waters and of all traffic in certain areas of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During a parliamentary debate held on 26 March this year, in connection with a motion of censure, the Portuguese Prime Minister interpreted the appointment of a Portuguese as a director-general in the Commission as a diplomatic coup for his government and criticised the previous Socialist government’s alleged inability in this sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequently, the Commission’s representation in Portugal publicly explained that senior appointments in the Commission are based on merit and competence, the principle of equal opportunities and geographical balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The choice of a Portuguese for this position was doubtless due to a favourable judgment of his merits. However, the statements made by the Prime Minister may give rise to doubts. In view of this, can the Commission say whether the appointment of a Portuguese as Director-General for Press and Communication was based solely on an assessment of his abilities with reference to the relevant criteria or on diplomatic pressure on the part of the Portuguese Government? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the transfer of an A1 official from the position of Director-General to that of Head of Cabinet in September 1999, Portugal had two A1 officials at the Commission, neither of which held the rank of Director-General. Since that time, Portuguese Governments have felt that there was a geographic imbalance which should be corrected and the Portuguese authorities raised the matter with us on a number of occasions. The House will be aware that it is not unusual and not irregular for Member States to raise these types of issues from time to time. The Commission listens to such views and gives them proper courteous consideration. The Commission nevertheless takes appointment decisions independently and solely in the interests of the institution. It would be entirely wrong for anyone to believe that the submission of views imposed pressure on the Commission. The Commission can confirm that the nomination and appointment of the new Director-General for Press and Communication fully conformed with the requirements of the Staff Regulations and with the Commission's internal procedures for the meritocratic selection and appointment of senior officials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As part of the evidence for that, I would suggest one item: it is the way in which I insisted – and my colleagues in the Commission readily accepted – that when Mrs Andreasen's suspension came she should be suspended on full pay, partly in order to make it absolutely, abundantly clear that the Commission was not in any sense prejudging her case – a case that is still under consideration because of prima facie evidence that she allegedly may have committed serious breaches of staff regulations. The disciplinary procedure as it has been conducted has been undertaken in scrupulous observance of the rules and with scrupulous defence of Mrs Andreasen's rights of natural justice. It is therefore regrettable, certainly – as all disciplinary procedures are – but it is certainly not ridiculous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This focus on access to safe water and sanitation was further reinforced in the context of the World Summit on Sustainable Development with the launch of the EU Water Initiative and the signature of the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership on Water Affairs and Sanitation.</p>
<p class="contents">After Johannesburg we started to concentrate on a long-term effort to translate these political commitments into action on the ground and, for sewerage, action under the ground. We are engaged in a dialogue to anchor the process at country level. The core of this action is to catalyse and support the engagement of all partners at the local, national and regional levels, from central and local governments to civil society users and private professional actors, reflecting the multi-stakeholder partnership approach under the Water Initiative. A key objective is to focus on the millennium development goals and the targets for access to water and sanitation for the poor. We negotiated this in Johannesburg and we are now trying to tackle the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also exploring the opportunities to increase financial support for these objectives, including the possible creation of a specific water fund using development aid as a catalyst to attract other financial resources in response to the countries' prioritisation of water in their poverty reduction and sustainable development strategies. This proposal by the Commission is presented in the recent communication on the establishment of an EU water fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, concerning drinking water in industrialised countries, the European Union started more than 20 years ago to take steps to secure drinking water quality. The Drinking Water Directive of 1980 established quality standards for drinking water as well as regular monitoring obligations, thus ensuring a high level of protection throughout the Union. In 1998 the Drinking Water Directive was amended to check the parameters and related values and, where necessary, tighten them up and ensure greater transparency and more information to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to comprehensively protect water resources, the European Union has recently thoroughly restructured its water protection policy by adopting the Water Framework Directive: protection of all waters, rivers, lakes, ground waters and coastal waters, establishing a binding obligation to achieve or maintain good quality for all those waters by 2015 at the latest; ensuring a broad participation of citizens, stake-holders, NGOs when developing the necessary protection measures; and underpinning the environmental objective by economic instruments such as economic analysis and water pricing, reflecting cost recovery and thus promoting the wise use of water and the protection of our water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental policy in the field of water is complicated and supported by targeted efforts in research policy, where the Sixth Framework Programme is devoting considerable effort and budget to the issue of water resources and their protection, and in regional policy both for the existing Member States by instruments such as the structural and cohesion funds and in candidate countries by instruments like ISPA and Phare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We adhere to the Programme for Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994. Chapter 8.25 of the Programme for Action states that ‘In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning. All governments and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations are urged to strengthen their commitment to women’s health, to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortion as a major public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved family planning services.’</p>
<p class="contents">In January this year I wrote to the European Parliament in response to a letter from 47 MEPs on the issue of abortion. In this letter, which is available on my website, I stressed that we aim to prevent the need for abortion, through our support for reproductive health programmes. However, we recognise that unsafe abortion is a reality that causes the unnecessary deaths of many women each year. The Commission regards national legislation as paramount when it comes to the question of abortion services within the formal health service. Furthermore, in countries where abortion is legal for given indications, it should be safe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s programmes and actions in the field of reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries aim to reduce maternal mortality and contribute to achieving the respective Millennium Development Goal. The stakes are high, maternal mortality rates have remained unchanged and are even on the increase in countries such as Malawi and Afghanistan. I would prefer Community aid in the areas of reproductive and sexual health to be judged on whether it delivers in reducing the unnecessary deaths of women in developing countries. This is what I find most important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with him that there are a large number of NGOs doing sterling work. Would he agree with me that women have a right to choose how they organise their lives? Abortion should of course be the last resort, but it is my belief that sometimes the teaching and doctrine of the Catholic church and its refusal to countenance family planning have done untold damage to the lives of millions of women in some of the poorest countries of the world. I hope that on this issue and related matters we can move forward as a result of the response by the Commission, and help reduce the number of abortions, by giving women access to the services they wish, should they wish them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Angola: current situation and outlook for democracy</span></p>
<p class="contents">In view of the changing situation in Angola and its strategic importance at regional and international level, it is a priority to develop a range of policies which will contribute to the consolidation of peace, the development of democracy and the reconstruction of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission's assessment of the current situation in Angola and its immediate future? What consideration is being given to the most serious humanitarian problems and the reintegration of ex-combatants? Has the Commission continued and strengthened the dialogue opened with all the political parties represented in the National Assembly, and with the churches and civil society? What is the state of play with regard to the Donors' Conference? What progress has been made as regards the transparency of public accounts and revenue accruing from the exploitation of the country's natural resources? Has the Commission been monitoring the specific situation of Cabinda, and what prospect is there that here too it might be possible to find a basis for democratic dialogue? What specific information does it have on the process of preparing and monitoring democratic, free and fair elections? What are the main measures being taken or prepared by the Commission in the context of cooperation with Angola in the following four areas: humanitarian aid; social development; reconstruction; training for democracy? How does it see the future development of these programmes? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The Commission considers that Angola has made substantial progress towards consolidation of the peace process since the signing of the peace agreement in April 2002 and that a return to war seems unlikely at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">However, several challenges persist which may threaten the stability of the country. These include the critical humanitarian situation, the reintegration of ex-combatants; the resettlement of internally displaced persons and returning refugees; democratisation and the reconstruction of the country – roads especially have been a very big problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the presence of landmines continues to be a major threat. In fact, when people started moving after the peace agreement had been signed, we saw an unfortunate increase in the number of accidents due to landmines – a terrible consequence. The Commission is continuing to assist the government and society in general to address these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the situation in Cabinda, may I refer to the answer to the question from the Member, written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2003-0640_EN.html">E-640/03</a> on this subject. The Commission is following the developments in the province closely, and there have been indications of some positive developments in the conflict recently.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall humanitarian situation, while still serious, continues to stabilise. Emergency pockets and areas exist throughout the interior of the country, particularly in areas where mines and damaged infrastructure still limit access.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers the successful demobilisation and reintegration of ex-Unita soldiers to be crucial for national reconciliation. There have been problems, but given the difficult circumstances, the demobilisation process can be qualified as successful, although reintegration has not yet been fully achieved. In March this year I visited Angola and also one of the biggest camps of ex-Unita soldiers, and had a thorough exchange of views with them concerning their prospects in this situation. Everything seemed relatively well organised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in contact with the political parties, although a regular dialogue really is not up and running yet. It is intended to strengthen the effort to create such a dialogue. As regards churches and civil society there is an ongoing dialogue as well as co-operation on a number of specific projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the donors’ conference<span class="bold">, </span>which will take place in Brussels<span class="bold">, </span>there is still no confirmation of date, modalities and agenda. The success of the conference is strongly linked to the establishment of a credible government plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country, including a poverty reduction strategy, as well as to an improvement of the relationship between the Government of Angola and the IMF. The Commission has repeatedly offered to assist in the preparation and organisation of the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency of public accounts and revenues from national resources, oil and diamonds, could improve definitely with the new economic team in place since the December cabinet reshuffle, although concrete results are not yet visible. The diagnosis of the oil sector, which the government is currently undertaking with KPMG should be an important element and the Commission awaits its publication with great interest. I raised these issues very directly with the government during the visit I just mentioned. The Commission and other donors are working together to encourage the government to increase transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The next presidential and legislative elections will be a crucial test for the government’s commitment to democratic practices. The Commission will follow developments very closely and has offered to assist in creating conditions for free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities for the European Community’s co-operation with Angola are spelt out in the recently signed Country Strategy Paper. In the short to medium term, priority is given to funding the measures necessary to support the peace process and national reconciliation, including creating the conditions for free and fair elections. In the medium to longer term, the Commission will gradually increase the focus of its support, concentrating aid on health, education and food security as the three main focal areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Angola has also been included as a focus country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to encourage the Commission to pursue a more wide-ranging and more open dialogue with all political forces represented in the Angolan parliament and indeed with all forces in civil society and the churches.</p>
<p class="contents">This open dialogue is our best chance of helping to consolidate pluralism in Angola and this, in the long term, is our best chance of consolidating democracy and freedom in that country. This has been demonstrated recently in a project with the Inter-denominational Committee for Peace in Angola (COIEPA), and I would encourage the development of other Commission-funded projects.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the situation of the UNITA ex-combatants is extremely worrying. I was part of an EP delegation that visited one of the camps and our feeling was that whilst the camps are working, things are more or less all right. Difficult, but all right. The worry is what will happen when the camps close, since things are extremely fragile, and it is taking a very long time to implement reintegration measures. My question is whether the Commission would be willing to direct resources specifically to programmes for the vocational training and social reintegration of UNITA ex-combatants and for these programmes to be monitored by both sides. This could be a way of following up the agreement of April last year in a practical way and of consolidating confidence and stability in Angola. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, owing to the structure of the peace agreement and the way in which the two opposing movements are in general able to talk and do things, we are now at a point at which peace is irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not rest on our laurels. The demobilisation and the reintegration of ex-combatants is a huge problem. The offers we and others can make have to be suited to the individual, and this is not an easy thing to do. Many of them should go back to agricultural activities and this is the key to doing what needs to be done concerning the majority of these people. I see the focus on health education and food security in our programme in Angola as something which will be useful for precisely this endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Portuguese Members closely follow everything that happens in Angola and the European Union must pay particular attention to Angola, given that other countries, such as the United States, are extremely interested in Angola’s natural wealth. It would also be rather negligent of the European Union not to view that country with solidarity in mind, which is crucial, but also bearing in mind the interests of the EU itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely believe, Commissioner, that the major test of Angola’s situation will be the presidential and legislative elections. These elections will give us an accurate reading of the democratic and civil situation in Angola, and will be decisive. We must therefore pay the utmost attention to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, I wish to ask a question on Angola’s intervention in neighbouring countries – because the Angolan Government and its armed forces have indeed been involved in various conflicts in neighbouring countries. Have there been any developments? Has Angola retreated to its borders and stopped intervening actively in the affairs of its neighbours? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In an effort to restructure, simplify and streamline texts some serious improvements were made. As for the development cooperation priorities, draft Article 1 provides a good basis, but at the same time we sympathise with the draft amendments proposed by Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation, notably where it suggests introducing references to good governance, environmental aspects and prevention of HIV/Aids.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that further improvements in the text are necessary. The Commission submitted on 5 May suggestions to the Convention to do so, including the following important points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, policy coherence (Article 1(3)), where we want the text to say that the EU will respect – this is the word – the principles and objectives of Article 1 in the development and implementation of external aspects of other Union policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, poverty focus (Article 25), where the Commission has proposed to make an explicit reference to the primary aim of eradicating poverty for EU policies in the sphere of development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, budgetisation of EDF (Article 26(4)), where the Commission wants to terminate the exceptional position of the ACP countries by deleting this paragraph and bringing, as a consequence, the EDF into the Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also noted the idea to set up a European voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps. It is not clear at this stage how it would operate. We should not forget that the delivery of EU humanitarian aid is a serious business, which requires technical expertise, experience and a high degree of professionalism. We work in dangerous corners of the world, where even the best-trained professionals are exposed to risks. Therefore, it will not be easy to create this sort of peace corps. We are committed to deliver effective support to people in often desperate situations, and we are working through the organisations we are funding. We are capable of doing this better than most other donors. Much needs to be done to bring this idea of a European voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps into the arena of what I would recommend. For the time being I remain sceptical about the idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the FTI – which, by the way, is also supported by the IFIs – but I am a member of Acronyms Anonymous and so are many other people. I think I will talk about 'education for all' and the 'fast track initiative'.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives set in Dakar and the Millennium Development Goals in this field of education are the basis of our policy in developing countries. Overall, the Community has allocated an estimated EUR 1.3 billion to education in developing countries for the next 5 years. This is the global figure. It is also providing substantial financing to ACP countries under the 9th EDF in the form of general budget support – EUR 1.66 billion – part of which will benefit the education sector. It is difficult to say exactly how much, and with what sort of direct focus, but one part of this is clearly relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context we devote full attention to the fast track initiative as a means to accelerate progress towards education for all. So far only 10 countries have an approved proposal for the fast track initiative, including 7 ACP countries. Unfortunately these 7 ACP countries have not chosen education as a priority sector in their cooperation with the Community. The Commission is therefore looking into the possibility of using old, dormant funds to support the fast track initiative in these 7 countries. The initiative has been prioritised as one of a number of possible so-called 'fast disbursement' mechanisms for the use of dormant amounts of old European Development Fund money. This process is now being discussed with the ACP partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the 10 countries that have an approved proposal for the fast track initiative, all other developing countries that meet the eligibility criteria for this, such as a full poverty reduction strategy paper and a credible sector plan, can expect further support to implement their plans. Where possible, the Commission will participate even through existing mechanisms or by recommitting dormant funds. This is now an ongoing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the analytical fast track is concerned, its exact role is still being defined. A specific working group has been set up to further develop this concept.</p>
<p class="contents">The timetable is also part of the issue. We recognise that further efforts are required this year and next year to ensure that the implementation of European Development Fund resources is managed in the most efficient manner possible. To this end, seminars were organised in February and March 2003, bringing together the different players in the project management cycle within the process. Delegations, DG-Development and AIDCO. During the seminars, in order to free up idle resources, a substantial effort went into identifying dormant commitments lying under previous EDFs. Targets were agreed with all delegations for decommitments to be achieved by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Decommitments imply an administrative procedure that also involves the headquarter. The same goes for recommitting the money, which will take place in the annual reviews. Partner countries of course have the final say on decisions to use these dormant funds for the fast-track initiative. This is not the only use of the money that we try to free up and accelerate the use of, but the fast-track initiative is clearly identified as one of the priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps the Commissioner could say something more, without specific reference to each of these countries, about the role that he envisages for the European Union. I understand that he also says that we are prepared to play a coordinating role so that we can deliver added value to the relations with – for example – the ACP countries.

<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer, does the Commission have a response to the question by Mr Alavanos, Question No 41, which is a very interesting question dealing with support for the tourist industry by means of the budget?</p>

The Commission is perfectly well informed, because it has received the questions and has put them in order. The situation is that questions which are not personal and which have not been scheduled have never before been answered in this Parliament. Why do they appear in the document? So that they can be answered in writing. That is why they are there. And today is the first time this has happened, and we take very good note of the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">If I had allowed Commissioner Nielson to speak for five or six minutes more – something which I had intended, or at least imagined doing – we would have used up the time, but the Commissioner, rather than speaking for 20 minutes, has spoken for 48 minutes, and we have therefore given him permission to leave, because he has spoken for an extra 28 minutes and we would have been asking too much of him.</p>
<p class="contents">In the question put to Mrs Schreyer, nobody asked supplementary questions, and we therefore had five minutes left over. Then, a Member who had not asked any supplementary question, when the debate had ended, said, ‘then I will put a supplementary question now’. You witnessed that just as I did.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I have given you a full explanation in accordance with my competences, but I agree with you that there should be prior warning of the questions which are going to be replied to in writing. And other Members, like yourself, must be aware that these questions are not scheduled to be replied to orally.</p>
