This proposed reform is, in my view, of real importance, including to European competition policy. This being so, Parliament has tried, in liaison with the Commission, to adopt important detailed regulations. As rapporteur, may I add that you, Commissioner Monti, held very intensive talks with Parliament, with the rapporteur and with numerous Members of this House, in a personal bid to ensure that numerous suggestions by Parliament were taken up alongside your considerations during the course of this constructive dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">So how do dealers in the European Union at present stand under the old block exemption regulation? What sort of agreements does the old block exemption regulation allow between dealers and the all-powerful car manufacturers? There are a number of very interesting comments we can make on the current situation. At the moment, dealers can only act for one manufacturer. At the moment, manufacturers can demand that dealers provide servicing as well as sales. At the moment, spare parts can only be sourced from the car manufacturer, not the spare part manufacturer. At the moment, car manufacturers can specify how many stock vehicles dealers must display on their forecourts.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation clearly bears all the hallmarks of a very one-sided division of power between the dealers and the manufacturers. I think that this draft for a new block exemption regulation will provide a broader base for small and medium-sized undertakings, as well as giving consumers the opportunity to buy on better terms by improving the market situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, dealers will be able to sell several makes. In future, dealers will not be obliged to offer both sales and servicing. In future, there will be more independent garages, independent repair businesses which can obtain the information needed to service and repair cars directly from the manufacturer, we have seen to that. These future advantages are all contained in this block exemption regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the current situation, manufacturers are sacking dealers by the dozen. I am not criticising that. Manufacturers must be free to reorganise their sales networks. But a total of 3 000 businesses have now been given their marching orders. This reform will let them stay in the market, this reform will give them the chance to continue trading.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the question of sales structures in the European Union. I think that the proposed sales structure, the structure proposed by Mr Monti, will give a tremendous boost to liberalisation. It represents a huge shake-up in the industry, compared with today's difficult conditions. This being the case, Parliament has proposed extending the transitional periods in order to give the market time to adjust. There will therefore be a broad majority tomorrow in favour of a proposal to extend the transitional period for the location clause to 2005. At the same time, we need a timely review clause so that we can see, given the market situation, if this location clause is still needed. The majority in Parliament is in favour of this proposal. I think that, with it, Mr Monti is assured of a broad majority in favour of his proposed reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, your reform proposal will receive the backing of a broad majority tomorrow. Our conclusion I think, looking at this reform at the end of this negotiation process, is that, once again, a specific industry has been granted an exemption from fair trading legislation. And I would also say that we need fewer exemptions for specific industries in future. The industry would therefore be well advised to gear itself up to the fact that there will not automatically be a follow-on regulation in 2010 and that we are working towards a time when there will no longer be any exemptions from fair trading legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and to thank him and all the other members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for being so cooperative. The committee responsible was able to include some of what we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposed in one form or another. We were able to confine ourselves in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to a very small number of proposed amendments, because we support the Commission's basic approach. You can never quantify it exactly, but I would say that we fully endorse 95% of the Commission's proposals. On numerous other questions, it was rather up to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to express an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We came to one main basic conclusion in committee. The current debate and all that has gone before have shown that this block exemption regulation, however esoteric it may sound, directly affects all our voters and will have far-reaching ramifications throughout Europe. And yet it is an act which the Commission can decide on autonomously, with the European Parliament only involved under a voluntary consultation procedure. With all due respect to the Commission and, more importantly, given the need for the Commission to remain impartial when it makes unilateral decisions and for the Commission to be shielded from unacceptable political pressure, I think that, when it comes to general competition law, these matters should come under the codecision procedure in future. As a member of the European convention, I took the liberty of submitting a proposal to the convention along these lines last Friday.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Committee on Legal Affairs also considered measures to maintain confidence and legal certainty, which is why we have proposed improvements to conditions of notice and compensation for dealers and focused on the location clause. My proposed transitional arrangement, which will be put to the vote tomorrow as the lead committee's Amendment No 28, is based on a number of considerations which give us cause to believe that it will improve competition. If nearly every other restriction on competition is removed from the new block exemption regulation – which, as we have said, is a good thing which we expressly support – then I think that we can keep the location clause in place for dealers for the time being, in order to ensure, among other things, that dealers in areas with less purchasing power – and I come from just such an outlying region – can survive and that the consumer supply line is not cut.</p>
<p class="contents">Location clauses on a non-growth market can help to protect us from the all too negative fallout from the concentration process. I think it is worth keeping an eye on this process for another two years. Then it will automatically be up to the Commission to introduce the final, decisive measures.</p>

I should also like to thank the Commissioner, who held a plethora of individual talks for the purpose of hearing our views and arguing his own. That alone illustrates how sensitive this issue is. We have before us a regulation which contains a derogation from competition law. We believe that this derogation cannot be maintained in the long term. Anyone who takes the view that freedom of establishment is one of the four freedoms and that competition is a fundamental factor in strengthening the internal market must say yes to both and to the basic idea behind Commissioner Monti's proposal. And we shall do so. But the point is, how can we bring the interested parties around to the idea of freedom of establishment and more competition? The interested parties are the manufacturers, consumers and, in between them, the small and medium-sized businesses represented by dealers, workshops and sales. We believe that it therefore comes down to the how and when of the changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">What Parliament has proposed are longer transitional periods, greater legal certainty and measures to maintain confidence, a yes to competition and protection for investments and new regulations for terminating agreements, even going as far as compensation if good faith is abused, together with a longer period and stronger form of notice. Commissioner, we have said it all, the transitional period until 2005 and a facility for review were the core elements of the debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. What we now ask is that you accept that we support your basic line but that you meet us half way on implementation on the basis of Parliament's resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have now received the praises of three Members and it will probably come as a surprise to you when I join them in their praises. Yes, I too must compliment you on having basically made a move in the right direction with this initiative, because the old block exemption regulation, for all its good points, is quite simply and painfully out of date. It has proven to have so many shortcomings that we really do need to make a clean sweep here. But you also resisted the temptation to say, let us do away with the block exemption regulation altogether. No, you have submitted a proposal which, to my mind, really does have a great deal to commend it: multiple brand sales, for example, the abolition of the compulsory linking of sales and servicing, which can now be unbundled, more independent workshops, independent spare part manufacturers and much more besides. On balance, this is the way towards more competition as the consumer understands it. But, surprise, surprise, the devil is in the detail and needless to say, fault can be found on a few counts. But, let me be perfectly clear, we are talking about details and I think, after a long debate in committee, we have reached a good compromise in several areas, for which we have the rapporteur to thank.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must say, Commissioner, as you know, I have reservations on one point and that is the location clause. As I am sure you realise, there are several ways of looking at this clause. You say – the Commission says – that what is being proposed here is good for competition and will slash prices. I have my doubts. I wonder if what is being proposed really is competition and if it really will improve competition. Because what is being proposed here means quite simply that manufacturers will pick and choose and limit the number of sales. From that point of view, there is little difference in comparison with the old system, except that they really will be able to compete with each other. What sounds perfectly plausible and reasonable to start with may harbour a huge risk; because it is a closed circle, the big fish will be able to eat up the little fish.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what worries me; that the end result will be that the small and medium-sized enterprises in the sales sector will be the first to go, eaten up by the large companies and resulting in more concentration even more quickly than is presently the case. That may cause prices to rise again at a later date, due to a lack of competition. That is why we have not suggested doing away with the whole idea. What we are saying is, let us include it in the regulation but postpone it. Then we really can look at it again in the light of specific events and decide whether or not to stick with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal is a step in the right direction, but we should like to have seen it go further in terms of free consumer choice, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will therefore be tabling some amendments tomorrow. We were, however, obliged to support the Commission’s proposal in order to avoid any further watering down. There are many interests at stake, with many interested parties involved, and, as you yourself, Mr Monti, recently mentioned in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, some of these interested parties will stop at nothing in their attempt to organise future car sales in the way that suits them best. Unfortunately, the car manufacturers’ view of what is in their own best interests does not coincide with what is beneficial for consumers. We have clearly seen this in the form of the massive lobbying that has gone on everywhere in recent weeks and months in order to prevent a genuine internal market for car sales being established, with the consequent benefits for both dealers and consumers. We are surely not giving away too much by naming names and saying that it was, in particular, a couple of major German car manufacturers, Mercedes and BMW, who knocked on our door.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority in the European Parliament obviously do not want all the benefits, however, while many of the key aspects of the Commission’s original proposal were voted down in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I had hoped we might have been able to reach a sensible compromise but, unfortunately, I have to say that I have been disappointed in this matter by a number of my otherwise good friends and allies in the Group of the Europe People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and in the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I should nonetheless like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Konrad, for the sound work he has done and for having tried to move things in the right direction. I should like to conclude by giving Commissioner Monti the greatest possible encouragement to stand firm on this matter and by, for once, asking him not to listen to the majority of the European Parliament who have not known how to look after the interests of the ordinary citizen and consumer. My message is therefore: do not allow special interests to steer developments in a direction which is of benefit neither to dealers, consumers nor the overall European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has not, however, been subject to co-decision. One of the Convention’s priorities must be to subject all the important regulations to the co-decision procedure and we are counting on Mrs Berger to do this. The draft text aims to reduce the substantial price differences in the Union, but these would be much less substantial if we harmonised taxation. Regarding the other points, must we really reduce competition and step up the intensity of distribution? There are limits to consumerism. Vertical agreements enable us to guarantee consumer safety and contribute to enhancing the industry’s robustness. We must make these agreements more flexible in order to increase the independence of the local dealer whilst maintaining the chain of responsibility. The chief danger of the draft text is the withdrawal of the location clause. This would pave the way for large, specialised companies and large retailers. We have also witnessed the sacking of the CEO of Virgin; you forgot to mention him, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen. If these distributors entered the market, it would spell disaster for small- and medium-sized businesses and it could lead to considerable job losses, and a loss of proximity to the consumer, except in the most profitable territorial areas. We are particularly concerned that the consumer will be exposed to the risk of a break in the sales and after-sales service link if the distributor is able to award after-sales service contracts to authorised repairers which are not subject to a location clause.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee calls for an assessment to be carried out in 2005 before any final decision is made regarding the freedom of establishment of distributors. This will provide an opportunity to examine the practices of reducing price differences that are compatible with maintaining the location clause. This is a reasonable compromise. Of course, other reforms could be envisaged at a later stage. The dialogue with the Commissioner was extremely positive overall: although we are not in agreement, we had an extremely useful discussion. And the work by our committee was also very thorough and I feel that it produced some worthwhile amendments. Parliament would be well advised to take on board most of these conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The draft Commission regulation, which seeks to revise the block exemption regulation on motor vehicles, concerns the future of an economic sector that is absolutely essential for many European Union Member States. Apart from the distribution of motor vehicles itself, several hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout Europe are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my next point: the debate underway today is not only a technical debate in which specialists alone can take part, it is a political debate as well, there is no doubt about that. What is being discussed here is a specific concept of Europe, or to be more precise, the way that our fellow citizens perceive Europe. Consumers are entitled, therefore, to speculate on the true motives of the Commission, a Commission that is desperately trying to transform a distribution system which, everyone agrees, has not only proven its worth but has also respected the main principles of competition. Why withdraw the location clause and the concept of territory? Why break the essential link between sales and after-sales service? Why pursue this extreme notion of multi-branding? Why introduce even more competition, when our motor industry is already one of the most competitive in the world? In my view, all these inconsistencies arise from a terribly dogmatic approach to competition, an approach that can also be found in other dossiers, such as merger control, for example. In the specific case of motor vehicle distribution, the truth that the Commission is deliberately ignoring is that we cannot achieve ideal competition and preserve what is a determining factor for consumers, namely, a network of dealers selling and repairing motor vehicles that is as extensive as the one we have in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge all my fellow Members to draw their own conclusions, taking into account economic and social realities. We must therefore have a vigilant and cautious approach. We must demonstrate a more balanced and fair frame of mind in relation to this dossier in which many different factors are at stake, ranging from those relating to consumer safety to that of employment in all Member States, as well as in the most remote regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the substance, the objections and prophecies of doom that are being voiced in opposition to the liberalisation of this sector are identical to those which were voiced in opposition to the liberalisation of all the other sectors. This liberalisation will bring greater efficiency, more competition, greater benefits for consumers and, not least, more employment as well. The Italian radicals will therefore firmly support the work of the Commission, aided by the Parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, supporting the amendments tabled by Mr Konrad, Mr Karas, Mrs Villers, Mr Huhne and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, which seek to strengthen, where necessary, the liberalisation process envisaged by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support the liberalisation proposed by the Commission. We believe that in the UK consumers have paid too much for their cars for too long and this Parliament should not postpone the cheaper car prices which will be the result of a more competitive market. Parliament should remember that though we must be sensitive to the concerns of small businesses, every dealer who writes to us probably has 100 or 500 or 1000 customers, whose interests we must also consider in this difficult debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a ban on location clauses is essential to delivering a competitive framework in the EU car market. Without the ban on location clauses, we would see almost no change from the present position, because without that ban consumers would still have to travel to another country to use a non-domestic dealer. We believe that we will not see price reductions in the EU unless location clauses go and dealers are free to set up in different EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to protect dealers, we should be protecting them from anti-competitive practices by car-makers and unlawful and unjustified termination of their franchises by car-makers. We should not be protecting dealers from the market and from ordinary competitive pressures because that is to deny consumers the cheap car prices which they deserve, and which this Parliament should be prepared to deliver to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, this document is consistent with various other regulations and documents which this Parliament has declared itself in favour of.</p>
<p class="contents">The distribution of automobiles has always had special treatment, a sectoral treatment, and, if pushed, I would say that this system may have made sense before, when there were different regulations for the different distribution systems, but perhaps it makes less sense now.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, however, regardless of this, that the different regulations that have been in force in this sector have not managed to remove the obstacles in that market. The differences in prices in the different countries are still considerable, essentially as a result of the actions of manufacturers who are determined to maintain national borders and prevent cross-border trade. We only have to look at all the decisions the Commission has taken and consider the considerable fines and penalties imposed on manufacturers as a result of this anti-competitive behaviour to realise how true this claim is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now presenting us with a new proposal for a Regulation which I believe takes us in the right direction. Some of the sectors involved tell us that they will go through hell if the Regulation is approved, and they forecast harmful consequences for the sector. I do not believe that this is true. However, I am sure that with the proposed measures manufacturers will be asked to maintain unjustifiably high prices as a result of anti-competitive actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential point of the proposal is the disappearance of the location clause for the dealer, and that measure is a step in the right direction. It is true that it may affect the structure of the distribution market, and I can therefore agree to a transitional period. However, not to approve this measure until a study is carried out and a new decision adopted, let us not deceive ourselves, represents subterfuge by those people who do not want this measure to be approved. Not now, not ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to focus on those, particularly by talking about some of the complexities of this regulation and making it work in practice. But, first of all, I want to join in the congratulations to Professor Monti on having the courage to move ahead with such a bold and a wide-ranging reform. I remember sharing a platform with him at a conference back in May 2000 when he set out his concerns very clearly. He has worked through that consistently. I am lending my support even though I am one of the relatively few people who have not been lobbied by the Commissioner. I know he has been very active in lobbying round Parliament for his proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to declare an interest because I have, in my former years, been a director of sales for a major car company. I have managed distribution all over the world. I am pleased that you see, Commissioner, that independent competing dealers will continue to be the foundation of providing good quality sales and service for consumers. In that connection I encourage colleagues to support the amendments that my colleague Mrs Villiers has proposed to reinforce that independence. It is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to you, Commissioner, that these regulations are exceptionally complex. You have given dealers a huge range of new weapons. They need to be encouraged to use those quickly and you will need to produce clear and unambiguous guidelines, on both sales and service. We must not underestimate the service you have done for consumers by opening up competition in after-sales and spare parts. That will in fact mean more to most consumers on an annual basis. They only buy cars relatively infrequently. This across-the-board approach will be good for consumers and I encourage you to make sure that those independent dealers really have the business security they need to invest and take advantage of your proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please do not let Europe's consumers down with undue delay in view of what you may have heard today. The principle of unripe time is always there to slow things down. New entrants to a multi-choice free-for-all will always be demonised as too rich or too unscrupulous.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that we have never been able to bring about greater competition in any area, and I include the airlines, without some rich people and some people varied in their approach coming into a market which is being opened up. The small dealer is being invoked as a victim here, but he has much to gain from a reform of franchising, as Mrs Villiers has said. The choice we expect from any other sophisticated personal equipment, the competition we look for in the maintenance of our houses, our computers and, yes indeed, our second-hand cars, is condemned here. It should not be. This is a widening of choice. Commissioner, you should listen to what is said in this debate, but you probably have more support here than the debate itself will disclose.

It affects all our guests and, as far as the industry is concerned, it affects a great many jobs and a great many small and medium-sized businesses, not just in the countries in which the cars are produced, but throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I too am affected and I shudder when I think of my last service bill, which was extortionate. That is why I am most grateful to the Commissioner for this courageous draft in favour of more competition. We have included a number of factors in this positive proposal, such as uncoupling sales and servicing and multiple brand sales, the location clause will be dropped and garages must be provided with information. So there will be much more competition here and I am most grateful to you for that, Commissioner Monti.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also most grateful to you for arranging such an intensive dialogue with Parliament, for exchanging views with us and for stressing time and again that Parliament's support is very important to you. For that too I am most grateful to you. We have a situation here in which the industry stands on one side, the consumers, whose rights we are strengthening, stand on the other, with the dealers sandwiched in between. It may well be that the dealers will suffer most. I personally lobbied in committee in favour of strengthening dealers' rights – and I am most grateful to Mr Konrad for his support here – by including an investment protection clause, for example. One point under discussion is the transitional period for the location clause and the question of a review. I think there is no need to stress out about the review. If we opt today for a specific transitional period and if we are convinced today that it may not work, then we should say so in no uncertain terms, we should state our reasons and then those of us who said as much today will be able to say we were right all along. It may be a way of introducing competition here, but if we are talking about a transitional period, then we should not shy away from a review. The European Parliament will come to its decision tomorrow and I for one would be delighted if the Commission, starting with Commission President Prodi, were to respect the vote of the only elected representatives of the people of Europe, even though we are not officially involved in the decision-making process here.</p>

For that reason it deserves our support, regardless of any changes that may still be made with a view to achieving a better overall balance of all the parties involved, but at the same time recognising that Parliament is currently being consulted on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, there is a place for actions to improve road safety through proper vehicle use. The new regulation represents a significant advance across the motor vehicle market, because above all it puts an end to the excessive power of car manufacturers, which in some cases are not far from abusing a dominant position. For example, the draft regulation deals with the roles of the motor vehicle trade, of wholesale distributors and of retail distributors in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the basic philosophy of the new regulation is, and I would like to reiterate this, essentially to defend the interests of consumers, not so much immediately, because there is no guarantee that there will be instantaneous significant changes in vehicle prices that will benefit consumers, but above all in the medium and long-term, once all the rules for active competition enshrined in the regulation have been assimilated. It is therefore vital for rapid progress to be made with this regulation so that economic operators can prepare for total liberalisation of this sector as from 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we can and must accept that the entry into force of the localisation provisions should be deferred for a reasonable period, and I regard such a deferral as being very much a question of positive discrimination for small and medium-sized enterprises. The public debate surrounding this legislative initiative has at times been dominated by the suggestion that there will be immediate and significant cuts in car prices. This will certainly not happen automatically. There could even be some perverse upward movement of prices in the short term. The objective announced by Commissioner Monti on behalf of the Commission will only lead to a satisfactory outcome if we make progress towards fiscal harmonisation. I hope that this new regulation will contribute to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I perfectly understand the Commission’s objective in proposing the removal of this clause. The Commission believes that the removal of this clause would increase competition between dealers and that would lead to a reduction in prices. Nothing could be more laudable for the Group of the European Peoples’ Party than the defence of freedom and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal as presented by the Commissioner, however, raises certain questions which should be cleared up before accepting a drastic solution. It seems clear that the current level between brands is sufficient. If the location clause is removed suddenly, do we not run the risk of reducing manufacturers’ capacity to organise their distribution network? Is there not a risk of the larger manufacturers swallowing up the smaller ones, thereby reducing competition?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission’s proposals, many of which are interesting, contain sufficient elements to promote competition within a single brand. Would it not be prudent to see how it works before we use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, is it not clear that investments made by dealers are in danger, and the smaller the dealer the greater the danger is, which would increase the market share for the large dealers, thereby working against the objectives of the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, since there have been no clear replies, I believe that the rapporteur’s proposal is a prudent one, there are times for valour and there are times for prudence and, in this case, it is clearly necessary to wait and see how the new elements to promote competition introduced by the proposal work before going ahead with the removal of the location clause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, you should rest assured that many in this House support you in this move even if some would perhaps suggest quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Car manufacturers will not change their behaviour. They are doing too well to want to do that and we have waited the best part of decade for them to do so since the last review. Will we have to wait another decade for them to come back to this House to say the same things time and time again? And, in the meantime, consumers across the European Union will have to pay, as they have always done, and as they will continue to do unless we tackle the issue of the cartel. It is very clear from your proposals, Commissioner, that you want to do just that and you have the support of the Labour delegation in this group and other delegations across this room.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the support which you have received here will give you the courage to continue in this bold move and that we will finally see some reduction in the activity of this cartel and some improvement for the consumer across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My heartiest congratulations to Mr Konrad on the huge amount of work he has done and the considerable effort he has put into this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the new regulation is to increase the level of competition across the board with a view to improving consumer well-being and safety and the functioning of the internal market. In order to achieve this last goal, it will also have to provide protection for dealers and encourage the small and medium-sized businesses operating in the European automotive sector. We therefore agree that the interests of consumers should take first place, and there are a huge range of possibilities within the common market. Increasing competition between sales distributors and in the after sales market and increasing competition in the manufacturing and distribution of spare parts must therefore be seen as positive.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, overlook the fact that, if the measures laid down in the new regulation are interpreted too rigidly or too loosely, they could reduce legal certainty and lead to forms of concentration in distribution<span class="bold"> </span>location, in after sales services and in spares production, causing a considerable number of small and medium-sized businesses to disappear from our market and impacting negatively on employment and the expected benefits for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has adopted an extremely favourable stance; it endorses the idea of a transition period until 2005 and a review clause. Naturally, we hope that the other groups will take the same stance.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the idea of protecting consumers by reducing car prices, the effectiveness of which is, as yet, completely unproven, will have to involve an evaluation of what happens during the transition period. The necessary conclusions will be drawn from the results which emerge and the new regulation will then be applied accordingly. During that period, dealers will, however, have the opportunity to invest, taking into account any restructuring of industry, and this would, in any case, be less harmful than a regulation which might work against the consumer and which would certainly penalise a large number of small and medium-sized businesses operating in the car dealership sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, this draft regulation is the product of a lengthy, in-depth process analysing the situation in the motor vehicle sector. In its November 2000 evaluation report, the Commission concluded that the current system had not yielded the intended results and that, therefore, it could not be preserved in its current form. The main goals of the future system are therefore clear: it must, first and foremost, promote the interests of the consumer, introducing greater competition and not just in the sale of new vehicles but in repair and maintenance services as well. In addition, the draft regulation seeks to guarantee the smooth functioning of the internal market in new cars. It is unacceptable, ladies and gentlemen, for cars, which are the very symbol of mobility, to continue to be one of the least mobile commodities on the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, the Commission has had to fine vehicle manufacturers which have blocked parallel trade. These practical cases show how consumers have been deprived of the benefit, of the right to choose where they purchase vehicles. In this sense, I would stress that the Commission’s aim is not to harmonise prices as such, but it does have the further-reaching, more fundamental goal of guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the internal market and, in particular, of allowing consumers to purchase vehicles directly or indirectly wherever they are cheaper. Lastly, independent dealers and repairers will benefit from the new package of rules for it will consolidate their financial independence and provide them with new commercial opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The reactions of consumer associations, automobile associations, spare parts manufacturers’ associations and independent repairers’ associations to the Commission’s draft regulation have been very positive. They feel that such a reform is definitely in the interests of European consumers. Indeed, some of their reactions say that the draft regulation does not go far enough. The leaders of European industry are continuously calling upon the European institutions to promote liberalisation and flexibility as the basic ingredients for a more competitive economy which will boost growth and employment. The draft regulation was conceived according to this approach, consistently advocated by European industry, which the Commission fully supports.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore surprised by the heavy lobbying against the draft regulation by a number of interest groups associated with the industry. The veritable twisting of facts and simply erroneous statements which have sometimes been produced in relation to the draft regulation are regrettable. They are in contrast with the availability and openness to dialogue shown by the Commission towards all the interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully convinced of the benefits which will be derived from the new regulation. It takes into account the specific nature of motor vehicles as a product. The new regulation seeks to ensure that vehicles are safe products, that they are provided with very reliable after sales services and that they respect environmental standards. We must have confidence – we do have confidence – in the many highly competent dealers who will take the appropriate commercial decisions. Ultimately, they are the ones who are most familiar with consumers’ needs and they are the ones who run the commercial risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the in-depth debates that have taken place on the Commission draft regulation in the European Parliament, particularly in the context of the discussions on Mr Conrad’s report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I too have found the dialogue extremely useful and constructive. I have taken note of your comments and I welcome the fact that the report adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs broadly supports the general lines advocated by the Commission, particularly with regard to the need to change the current system.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now focus briefly on the most important draft amendments contained in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. One of the most important elements of our new system is the prohibition of use of the location clause. This is the linchpin of the system and it is necessary for the other measures to be fully effective too. The abolition of this clause applying to vehicle sales, which will allow dealers to open secondary sales and delivery outlets in other areas, including in other Member States, is essential to facilitate consumer access to vehicles sold by dealers from other Member States at lower prices. This will increase competition between dealers selling the same brand of car and encourage market integration, making multi-brand sales possible too. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes to establish a transition period for this measure – the abolition of the location clause – lasting until 1 October 2005 and to make abolition of the location clause dependent upon the results of an assessment. I realise that the transition period would allow both manufacturers and dealers to prepare themselves and to adapt to the new system, but I feel frankly that it would be detrimental, extremely detrimental to postpone a decision on abolishing the location clause until a future assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not advisable to prolong a state of uncertainty regarding the future system; rather, we need to establish clear rules right from the word go, or else – we have to admit – this transition period would serve no purpose: the operators would not know which future system to adapt themselves to and it follows that they would not make any preparations for the entry into force of the new rules. It would not be a transition: it would, let us be quite clear about this, be a mere waiting period, a period of waiting for a new Parliament and a new Commission in order to decide on the future motor vehicle distribution system in Europe. As one of you has said, it would be an excuse to put off the decision indefinitely. The Commission believes that we must shoulder this responsibility as of now. We cannot continuously declare that we want a European Union that is closer to the citizens – how many times have I heard that said in this House and how I agree with it – and then, when the time comes to take decisions, fail to behave accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">That aside, as I said to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am prepared to consider whether a longer transition period than that laid down in the draft regulation might be appropriate, but purely with regard to the location clause. Nevertheless, we must not forget that, if we extend the transition period, we will also be putting off the time when consumers will be able to benefit from the new system.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards multi-branding, one of the draft’s key objectives is to make it genuinely possible for dealers to sell different brands if they so choose. The draft seeks to make multi-branding easier for dealers while still protecting the brand images in which manufacturers have invested, thus facilitating consumers’ freedom of choice and increasing competition between brands. I agree that the brand image is the most important competition tool for vehicle manufacturers, but there is no justification for requiring separate showrooms or different staff for different brands and this would remove the financial advantage of multi-branding for dealers. I would also point out that multi-branding is particularly important for small dealers especially, for it can help them to establish themselves and survive in rural areas. It would not be right to leave this aspect to the two parties to negotiate while dealers are financially completely dependent on their suppliers. To strengthen the position of dealers, therefore, we must give them the facility to decide whether to display different brands of vehicles in separate areas of the same showroom or whether to display them in separate showrooms, and whether to employ different sales personnel for each brand.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel, moreover, that Parliament should agree on the need to protect dealers in the way the Commission has proposed: the minimum period of notice and the obligation to provide detailed reasons for termination of a contract are intended to strengthen the position of dealers.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation also seeks to alter the, at present, extremely close link between the sale of new vehicles and after sales services. A dealer can choose whether to focus its activity purely on selling vehicles or whether to provide after sales services as well: this right strengthens its independence. Since after sales services can only be subcontracted to authorised repairers, a high level of quality and safety is guaranteed. In my opinion, in its original form, the Commission’s draft already ensures that there will be a service point near a dealer where the dealer subcontracts the activity, but, in the light of the amendments put forward in this regard, a solution could be to require the dealer to inform the consumer of the distance of the premises of the authorised repairer from the sales outlet as well as the location. I must stress that it is particularly important to make the link between sales and after sales services less binding in a period when networks of dealers are being restructured and their numbers reduced. Dealers whose agreements are terminated can now remain in the market as authorised repairers. In view of this and in order to safeguard the consumer interest of having a wider network of service centres, it would be a mistake to limit the number of authorised repairers.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I broadly endorse the amendments intended to increase access to technical information and to clarify the definition of spare parts.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, Mr President, I have noted and I welcome the favourable attitude of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the approach taken by the Commission. I have told you where I stand with regard to the main amendments proposed by the committee and I would ask the Members to be so good as to take these considerations into account when they vote. The very fact that the Economic Committee’s report broadly supports the line taken by the Commission is evidence that Parliament is not giving any heed to the black picture painted by the lobbyists who presented the Commission’s draft as some sort of disaster. You might remember that there were similar reactions when the Commission opposed continuing duty free. It was said that we would cause 140 thousand job losses. Considerable political pressure was exerted at high levels then too and there was a huge lobby. The Commission refused to be influenced by the pressure. Duty free was abolished, to the benefit of the taxpayer, and there was absolutely no disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Members for this dialogue. I would also like to thank them personally for their appreciation. Some of you have described our actions as courageous. I am much obliged, but I really do not think that working to promote the citizens’ interests is being courageous. If I might express my personal opinion, I am sure that the citizens, your electorate, expect Parliament to be at least equally courageous.</p>
