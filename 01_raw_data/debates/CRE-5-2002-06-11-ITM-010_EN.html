<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hautala (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, for the first time now, the European Parliament has participated in reforming Community legislation on equality by virtue of the codecision procedure. I am pleased to inform you all that the European Parliament has genuinely left its mark on this directive, whose purpose it is to prevent any kind of discrimination at work on grounds of sex. I believe that many will have noticed that it is the European Parliament that has made the most innovative proposals of all, which are now incorporated in this key directive on equality at work.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to our demands, employers in the European Union will for the first time now be obliged to take committed action to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. The very fact that employers will be obliged to take action is very important as the problem has to be addressed through action and not just by issuing various declarations. This means that employers that fail in their obligation to create working conditions that pre-empt sexual harassment may also become liable for prosecution by the courts as a result. In practice this means that structures must be created at the workplace where an employee is guaranteed to receive help when harassment has occurred, and where any such action also has a preventative effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to a requirement by the European Parliament the directive also includes the idea that equality has to start being promoted at the workplace through concrete planning. This means that we have created a grassroots instrument that guarantees that employers and employees will, through a united effort, make a survey of areas that are unsatisfactory at their workplace and that they can eliminate them through the same united effort. In this regard I might say that developments in EU legislation are moving very much in the direction of the Nordic model. These sorts of instruments have been in place for some time now in the Nordic countries, and not just there but also in countries such as Belgium and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will also afford greater protection from discrimination against mothers and fathers at the workplace. It is obviously very important that when parents, whether fathers or mothers, return to work from paternity, maternity or parental leave, they can actually be given a job equivalent to the one they did before and can also enjoy all the benefits they would have had while they were away from work.</p>
<p class="contents">From this you may have already concluded that fathers and men in general have now been included in the Community legislation on gender equality. This is also absolutely vital as there is much debate going on in all our Member States about how men can be included in the promotion of equality. We should also take into account the fact that men can also be victims. An employer may also discriminate against a father returning to work from parental leave or insisting on his statutory right to work a shorter working day. This directive now forbids all such discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important that under this directive all Member States must establish an authority that is in practice responsible for promoting these developments and which also monitors them. I would like to say that this will be of particularly great importance for the future Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, where the position of women has become noticeably problematic with the structural changes that have been taking place. In this way the European Union can also promote concrete improvements in gender equality in the future Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should feel very pleased with the results of this conciliation process. We have in practice achieved all our objectives and I might also say that the level of cooperation among the political groups has been quite excellent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We had rejected that proposal on the basis of my report, which was debated on 8 March 1999, and had asked the Commission to table a more robust text. For once, it is neither the Commission nor the Council that are responsible for this deplorable delay. The rapporteur lost us a lot of time, firstly by tabling her report late and secondly by overloading it with proposals that had no sound legal foundation, some of which related to other directives. At conciliation we were able to discard these counterproductive amendments that had been adopted at first and second reading against my group’s wishes. If people had listened to us then, women would already have been benefiting from the new directive for at least a year now, and it does represent a genuine improvement on the text that has been in force since 1976, a text which nevertheless has had the great merit of making progress in particular on equal treatment for men and women in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that, thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the positive measures have been safeguarded: the right of women to return to the same job or an equivalent post after maternity leave is essential; the right of men to the same job guarantee after a period of paternity leave is recognised, if such leave exists in the Member State of which they are nationals, and this is also the case after adoption leave, if it exists in a Member State. The definitions of sexual harassment, like those of direct and indirect discrimination, are useful and I hope that they will prove to be relatively robust, so as not to cause unnecessary litigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to distance myself from Paragraph 9 of Mrs Hautala’s report, because it states that the delegation regrets that the Council was unwilling to prohibit a general exclusion of representatives of one sex from a particular professional activity or professional training. This general prohibition is enshrined in the existing directive, the article in question, Article 2 Paragraph 1, being maintained. It would therefore serve no purpose to repeat it. I am all the more pleased with the outcome of the conciliation because finally – as I have said – my group’s responsible and reasonable position has prevailed, thanks also to the Council and the Commission, who have done a great deal to talk round some over-excited members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, who had not understood that the best is often the enemy of the good. If Parliament wishes to be taken seriously as a co-legislator then it must not confuse a legal text with a resolution, in which anyone can indulge in wishful thinking and reveal all of their wildest dreams. Above all, we must not forget that a legal text has to have a sound legal base and be possible to implement. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She never fails to reiterate her opinion, but if Parliament, Mrs Hautala and the entire Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities had followed Mrs Lulling’s approach, we would not be here today expressing our satisfaction, for hers was without a doubt a minority proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to thank Mrs Hautala because, despite the difficulties of the negotiations, we have succeeded in achieving an excellent result. Why were the negotiations difficult? Because the difference between the Council and Parliament’s positions was considerable. Mrs Hautala’s approach and the commendable cooperation of all – and I repeat – all the groups, and the willingness shown by Commissioner Diamantopoulou and the Spanish Presidency, whom I would like to thank, to find solutions, mean that the result we have achieved is significant. Why is it significant? Because, three years on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we can, at last, say that things are starting to change. The Treaty of Amsterdam was a leap forwards in terms of recognition of the principle of equal opportunities and we now, at last, have a directive which provides specific, accurate definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, a directive which, in addition to providing an important definition of harassment and sexual harassment, recognises without a shadow of doubt that sexual harassment is to be considered direct discrimination and is therefore a punishable offence, a directive which recognises the importance of maternity and paternity leave and adoption and therefore the need and the right of mothers and fathers returning from such leave to be provided with equal or equivalent work, a directive which recognises the need for and compels each Member State to lay down equal and proportionate sanctions, a directive which, moreover, recognises independent bodies and makes companies responsible for producing equal opportunities plans, thus making positive actions under Article 141 possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this result as significant, Mr President, particularly because the matter is being discussed by the Convention and, on the basis of this result, we will be able to call for a further step forward to be taken in the Convention too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore not only out of politeness that I say this but in genuine recognition of the fact that there is someone who has in actual fact been able to make a difference in this area and has demonstrated in practice that an individual MEP too can set a good agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, with this report and the work that has been done, we have passed a milestone in the EU’s journey to equality. We have, first of all, arrived at a definition of what sexual harassment really is, and that is very useful. There are a number of countries which really had not adopted a position on this issue before. We have also obtained a ban on discrimination against women who are pregnant or who have recently given birth and, in certain cases, also against men on paternity leave, if there is national legislation on this subject. Finally, we have obtained the option of making positive special arrangements in cases where these are required by one or other gender. All in all, I think the result is splendid.</p>
<p class="contents">We now come to the series of commitments assumed by the Member States in connection with this directive, and I want specifically to highlight the equality monitoring bodies, as they are called. At a recent meeting with the candidate countries, the latter were very much occupied by precisely that issue because they have a lack of data and because it is necessary for them to have means of putting pressure on their own governments with a view to acquiring this data. I also believe, however, that we have to say that we shall be keeping an eye on this issue in our own countries, because it is something that the Member States can easily avoid tackling. I have unfortunately experienced a little of this in my own country, but I will not labour that subject any more. I nonetheless believe that it is up to all of us to keep an eye on this matter so that we are both of help to the candidate countries and assume responsibility ourselves in our own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fraisse (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Heidi Hautala for the time that she has devoted to this directive and for her work, which shows that she has been equal to this task and has merited the trust placed in her by the members of her committee. I also wanted to say how glad we are to be taking part in a codecision procedure on equal treatment and women’s rights, which does not happen so very often.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that this directive seems to me to mark progress on two extremely important fronts. The first is that its scope has finally been extended. All family-related issues, such as maternity leave, adoption and also adoption leave – and God knows how important these are for us – have been recognised. The presence of the father and the need for the father not to be penalised if he takes leave are recognised. This is what I would call an extension in favour of family life. I am very happy that all of this now comes under this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, all harassment-related matters now enter into the scope of application of this directive. Here harassment is considered to be discrimination. We tend to deal with the issue of violence against women from the point of view of moral standards. Here we deal with it from the point of view of discrimination, so from the point of view of the fight for equality between men and women. I particularly welcome this and I believe that the efforts we made to draw a distinction between the two definitions of harassment were extremely worthwhile. I myself had recourse to this new standpoint last week in France, where although our law dates from 1992 it does not really include a definition. This new definition will therefore be very useful in all of our Member States. That is why I consider this to be so important.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is also the whole dimension of obligation. If all of these things that we are asking for are to become a reality, we need obligations and not just wishes and desires. This would appear to me to be fundamental and, since I still have a few seconds left, I will take the liberty of sharing with you a discovery I made today. If you cross the footbridge and go upstairs, you will find a door with a sign indicating the room set aside for this Parliament’s cleaning staff: the sign shows a woman holding a brush. I think that we still have a great deal more work to do, because I want there to be equal treatment in domestic services as well as within the large professions that we are trying to represent here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
