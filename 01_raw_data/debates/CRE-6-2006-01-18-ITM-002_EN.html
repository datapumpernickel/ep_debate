<p class="contents">It gives me great pleasure to be able to address the European Parliament. It is an honour to present, on behalf of the Republic of Austria, a brief summary of the programme for the six months of our presidency. The European Parliament is a very special institution, embodying as it does, in a unique way, the strength of the new Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament is the result of a historic election in 2004. For the first time, 25 nations held free elections simultaneously; they elected their assembly to represent them, the <span class="italic">Populus Europaeus</span>, the European people. The division of Europe was thus ended once and for all, although the process of reunifying Europe is still proceeding unabated.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament is a marvellous illustration of the greatest strength of this new Europe, with its diversity of ideas and experiences, its history and also its life stories and its hopes. We know that the tone of Europe is not that of a solo instrument but that of an orchestra, and the same applies to this Parliament. Europe is not monochrome but colourful, as the logo of the Austrian presidency symbolises. And this strength, this diversity, the numerous identities of Europe, make our Union what it is. No country has lost out by acceding to the European Union. All of us have benefited. We have gained freedom, peace, security and paths to prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet if everything is so wonderful, you might well ask, why are so many of our citizens distinctly sceptical? We must be quite specific about this and analyse the situation honestly. The high points of the historic year of 2004 were followed by a particularly difficult phase. After three years of intensive negotiations on a new constitution, the outcome was rejected in referenda in France and the Netherlands. Then came the strenuous tug-of-war over the Financial Perspective for the next seven years. There were terrorist attacks in some EU capitals, growing concerns among the population about further enlargements of the EU and a real lack of trust among the people of the EU in its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we have made it an aim of the Austrian presidency to tackle this particular problem. By the end of our presidency we want to see new growth in people’s trust in Europe, in trust between the Member States and indeed in trust between the European institutions. If we want to achieve that aim, we must first seek answers to the major questions that occupy people’s minds.</p>
<p class="contents">A friend of mine, the great Austrian quantum physicist Anton Zeilinger, drew my attention to a facet of physics of which I had never really been aware and which I certainly found extremely fascinating. He told me that the question is the important thing. In quantum physics, he said, this is far more elemental than in the general ideological context. The question elicits the truth, and the way in which the question is asked determines the quality of that truth. This is why we must begin by asking these questions. They must be straight questions, and we must also be aware of their unpleasant implications. We shall not have equally satisfactory answers to all of them, but we must also beware of rapid shortcuts. There is a need to listen, for Europe must be both useful and protective. The many real threats that exist are helping to focus our minds on these attributes.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January of this year, the day on which we took over the presidency, the New Year concert was held in Vienna, an event in which we try to radiate a little optimism as well as merriment. Just as the Latvian conductor, Maris Jansons, raised his baton, the Russians cut their gas deliveries, first by 30% and then, in the night of 1 to 2 January, by 50%. Martin Bartenstein, the Minister for Economics and Labour, who is responsible for energy affairs, then had the task of seeking solutions with our partners – the Ukrainians, the Russians and our European partners – and with Commissioner Piebalgs. This incident brought home to us that, in a matter that has hitherto fallen within the reserved powers of the Member States, major problems can now be resolved only at the European level. This is an area where we need more European involvement.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to reducing dependence on a single supplier, of diversifying, of stocking sufficient reserves and of making energy-supply networks secure – which will only be possible, incidentally, if we encourage long-term investments and permit long-term supply connections and contracts – we must not take the short-term view and focus on profits for the next quarter; long-term solutions are the only answer for Europe. It is also a matter of choices. I have always defended the right and responsibility of every country to choose its energy sources. We have chosen our way, which does not include nuclear technology and its peaceful use, and I shall uphold that decision. But I shall also campaign for every country’s right to preserve its freedom of choice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must take very great care not to slide into a one-sided approach. We in the European Union must work together to put safety standards first, and we must devote more attention than ever to renewable sources of energy and ensure that every option of importance to us and to our environment is fully explored.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This question of the security of energy supplies will be an important topic in the European spring summit. At this point I should also like to thank the British presidency of the Council for dealing comprehensively with this question and showing a good nose for imminent developments by giving it ample attention at Hampton Court. We shall cooperate closely with the Commission too in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Other topics are the fight against bird flu and the need for a firm stand against the Iranian nuclear modernisation programme. In these areas, more Europe and a united European front in the global arena are essential if we are to be able to give security guarantees to people in the world and especially in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second very important topic which is preoccupying people is that of growth and employment. It is the key subject of the spring summit, for without jobs, without the prospect of finding work, it goes without saying that the people of Europe will become increasingly apprehensive. Many feel that Europe is doing too little for them in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now 25 reform programmes on the table, which the Commission will assess. We have opted for a mix of specific verifiable voluntary commitments by the 25 Member States plus recommendations from the Commission with a view to moving into the practical phase of the initiative and achieving visible results. No politician can promise jobs today; to do so would be rash. But we can create favourable conditions. Everyone knows, and you know best of all, that with 1% of Europe’s gross national income, as in the present budget, or with 1.045% or 1.1%, it is not possible to create millions of jobs. We can, however, set an example, and we can verify the Member States’ fulfilment of their voluntary commitments. Above all, we can put some new items on the European agenda that have perhaps received less attention in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these items, in my view, is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. Many such businesses used to complain that they received insufficient attention, that they did not have enough access to capital and to EU programmes. We have to realise that SMEs could be the only real job machine in the Union. SMEs are a sleeping giant that we must waken. SMEs need access to capital markets, research and development, and this is something the Commission must address in the SME programme it presents. They need access and consideration when it comes to the allocation of regional support from the structural funds. The Better Regulation programme must include specific measures to lower SMEs’ administrative costs. Cutting red tape is an important objective, particularly with regard to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another great source of strength that has not been adequately tapped is the partnership between the representative bodies of management and labour at the European level, the European social partners. From our Austrian experience, I can say that democracy and the market economy cannot work properly without free, strong and independent representatives of employers and employees. The Austrian model is certainly quite interesting. It is not as if agreements are reached without discussion: there are very frequent exchanges of opinion and sometimes even wrangles. It would be absurd to think that these things could be settled without arguments in a democracy. They often serve to pep up the political debate. Under our presidency, I should also like to invite the European social partners to join us in the pursuit of these goals – jobs, growth, energy security – and I have already had very good talks with the European Trade Union Confederation and the employers’ organisation UNICE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Services Directive will be very important in this respect. I know that Parliament has been grappling tenaciously with this matter. After more than 1 000 amendments, you will have seen for yourselves how difficult it is to combine the opening of such a large sector of the market with the guarantees that the public expect of us. It goes without saying that the opening of markets must necessarily be accompanied by resolute action against social dumping and by efforts to protect the familiar public services that our local authorities have traditionally provided. We need that balance. Openness and protection are what is expected of us. I should like to have the social partners with us in this effort so that a proper balance can be struck.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to all of this, of course, is sufficient growth. There is no getting away from that. Above all, the spring summit must be devoted to the stimulation of growth. This requires not only research and infrastructure but enlargement too. Enlargement, if prudently and properly carried out, can be a growth strategy for Europe as well as for our industries in the old Member States. If we had 3% growth, coupled with at least 1% employment growth, the present unemployment figure of 19 million would be halved within five years. That is a hugely ambitious target, but if we also enhance our training systems and create greater flexibility, we can achieve it. This is surely where the real work has to be done. Faced with fierce competition from Asia and the United States and in the light of present demographic trends, we simply cannot afford to have part of our labour force inadequately trained or fail to maximise its employability.</p>
<p class="contents">A very important issue for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament will, of course, be the negotiation of the Financial Perspective for the next seven years. I make no bones about this. We need and want your cooperation, because the creation of a seven-year Financial Perspective – a rare occurrence, since most of our budgeting covers a period of only one or two years – naturally brings security and predictability. I know there are many in the European Parliament who are not content with what the European Council only just managed to adopt in December after much toil and trouble, but I must also tell you plainly that those who want more research must look first and foremost at the national budgets. If we in the Member States were truly committed to implementing what was, after all, our own decision to devote 3% of our national budgets to research by 2010, that would produce not only EUR 200 billion a year for research but 50% more, in other words EUR 300 billion – far more than an allocation in the general budget, however ambitious it might be, could yield. I must be frank with you: we are reaching our limits with the Financial Perspective. If we go on having to, or choosing to, engage in the surgical removal of membership contributions from national budgets to finance the work of the Union, this will have been the last time we managed to put together a Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall tell you straight – and some may not like to hear this – that Europe needs to become more self-funding. It is not right that we should have to extract all our resources from the national budgets, which are already under pressure. That is precisely what drags us into this lamentable tension between net contributors and net recipients, into a situation where everyone looks for winners and losers. The idea of a shift in the direction of self-financing may not be universally popular, but my duty as President of the Council is not to say popular things but rather to say what needs to be said. I believe we must focus attention on this point, and I know that the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, takes a very similar view. It is up to the Commission to put all these considerations on the table in the review of 2008/09. It is surely absurd that the profits of short-term financial speculation are completely exempt from taxation today. It is unacceptable that tax loopholes exist and that international air or sea travel is practically tax-free. Europe cannot tolerate this situation when there are important tasks that cannot be financed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the Commission to include this issue in its review, and I also ask explicitly for the support of the European Parliament. If we want a strong Europe, we cannot coyly or timidly avoid this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in the front row I see Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and our esteemed High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, who often have to go round cap in hand to raise money for vital peace missions, and all because we have not had the courage to discuss these matters sufficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Europe you represent also needs new solidarity among the institutions. It makes no sense for the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States to criticise each other. We are all in the same boat, and we have to row in the same direction. Not head-to-head confrontation but hand-in-hand cooperation – that is my principle and my motto for this presidency. We must listen when some of our citizens bemoan the misuse of EU funding or the squandering of resources within some programmes. There are cures for these ills in the form of independent scrutiny. We must listen when some people call for greater transparency in European decision-making – in the Council’s legislative activity, for example – or for funding awards to be publicised so that people know who has actually benefited. Why not? It is only right that such information should be published. This is European taxpayers’ money. We must work together on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also listen to people who say, ‘It is all very well to have a fairly efficient economy, but what has happened to the protection of ordinary people, to social cohesion and to care for the vulnerable?’</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago, in his <span class="italic">lectio magistralis </span>at the European College of Parma, Jacques Delors made a statement that struck a chord with me.

<p class="contents">‘Finding a balance between social values and the power of the market economy, and recognising social issues as a development factor and not as a by-product of the economy.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> I find that incredibly interesting. This is the very motto that ultimately sums up our European way of life and that we shall also take with us into the discussion on the future of Europe, with which I should like to conclude my remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first half-year up to the June summit, it falls to us to conduct this discussion on the future of Europe. Since last June the Austrian presidency has had a mandate to engage in such a discussion together with the European Parliament here, with the Commission, which we also ask for fresh impetus, with the national parliaments and, of course, with the European public. Parliament, I know, will – today or tomorrow – adopt a good and well-balanced resolution on the basis of a report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I take that very seriously and will continue to do so during the Austrian presidency. It must not be an elitist debate; Europe concerns everyone. Many Europeans are longing for involvement, for a stake in the future of Europe. It is not only about a document. It is about far more than that: it is about the identity of Europe. What connects us? What internal forces actually hold us together? It is about a fair division of responsibilities: what can Europe do, and what must it do? Those who seek to resolve the major issues must have both hands free to tackle the task. Our hands will not be free unless we let go of other things. An earnest desire to resolve major issues presupposes readiness to relinquish responsibility for minor issues to other institutions. This is where the word ‘subsidiarity’ comes into play, a concept we are forever invoking in our soap-box rhetoric. We must bring it to life. To this end, we shall devote a special conference to it after Easter.</p>
<p class="contents">This discussion is also about the boundaries of Europe. Translated into concrete terms, this means the criteria that determine the absorption capacity of the Union. These boundaries must not be drawn by surveyors or geographers. They are a political matter. The political debate must focus on absorption capacity. It must also focus on the visibility of Europe in the world and within its own borders. I think it is wrong that we should only meet in Brussels or here in Strasbourg. Europe must be visible in its peripheral areas too, in other aspects of life. As a presidency, we see how interesting it is for people to discover, experience, grasp and sense that Europe is not afraid to reach out to its citizens. They must even be able to vent their anger on occasion so that this European model can work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about a European way of life. I have never understood why, when the Americans talk proudly of their way of life, we Europeans never dare to talk openly, boldly and with pride about our own. Peace, security, democracy, human rights, solidarity and quality of life – these are things that are not to be taken for granted, nor are any of them achieved without a struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of these considerations, we shall present a draft route map with timetables and/or an interim report by the month of June. Controversies and divergent points of view are not only deemed acceptable in this discussion but positively welcomed. The worst thing would be for me to convene a discussion here to which nobody came or no one contributed. As Martin Buber once said, everyone is called to bring something in this world to completion. This applies especially to Europe. Europe is teamwork. The British held the presidency before us. We shall build on their work, and this year, we and the Finns have a well-coordinated joint operational programme on the basis of which we shall conduct our presidencies in tandem. In so doing, we intend to be reliable partners for you in the European Parliament and for you in the Commission. I look forward to our cooperation with great confidence, and I also hope that we can enthuse and inspire the people of Europe with our joint efforts. I wish you all the very best.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to take the floor today on the occasion of the presentation of the work programme of the Austrian Presidency. We are all aware of the skills and the traditions of Austrian diplomacy. If I may say so, I have long been aware of Mr Schüssel’s intelligence and of his devotion to the European cause.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that this Presidency can begin its work already, armed with a vision of the financial perspective, thanks to the agreement obtained at the December European Council. As I have already said, this agreement marked an important moment for Europe, a moment in which Europe was able to demonstrate that it continues to be effective and relevant. The agreement has enabled a relatively optimistic climate to be created for 2006, which will be a crucial year.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now pursue, and give concrete expression to, this dynamic approach. Although the Council took a step forward in December, it is now up to us to take the next step together, that is to say to make very swift progress in negotiating and concluding an interinstitutional agreement. I have been saying this for months: the agreement of the three institutions is necessary, and effective cooperation between them is crucial. It is now time for us to turn our words into deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, allow me to lay special emphasis on the measures connected to citizenship, particularly those related to culture and to young people. Further efforts are required in this area in order to fulfil our shared commitment to make our people more in touch with our measures and to promote the European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">As from 1 February, the Commission will be proposing an amended draft interinstitutional agreement, which will serve as the basis for our negotiations. As you know, aside from the question of resources, we still need to specify important points on which the Commission has fully exercised its influence: more flexibility and adaptability of our resources, the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the prospect of a revision clause. The Commission considers that these elements of flexibility will be crucial in reaching an agreement between the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also work together towards the adoption of a set of legislative proposals that will give effect to the interinstitutional agreement, once it has been adopted. In that area too, efforts will be required of the Council groups, the parliamentary committees and the Commission services. This is a real challenge but one that we cannot overlook. We must in fact see to it that the Union is ready to get down to the job on 1 January 2007. If the deadlines were to be missed, then we would seriously run the risk of being late in implementing the Structural Funds, which are key elements for solidarity within an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in the context of Europe, the forthcoming year is, on the one hand, rich in possibilities and, on the other hand, fraught with responsibilities. The Presidency will be able to count on the Commission’s full support and cooperation. We see a close interrelationship between the programme of the Austrian Presidency and the objectives pursued by the Commission since taking up its duties, and particularly its strategic objectives. Armed with its culture and values, Europe will be able to go forward if it can simultaneously make progress in three areas: economic performance, social cohesion and the sustainable management of its resources.</p>
<p class="contents">To succeed in this, Europe needs a real partnership involving all the actors. We need everyone’s contribution so that Europe can release its full potential. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, growth and jobs are the core preoccupation of our citizens. We must show them that Europe can deliver a credible response to their concerns. The Spring European Council in March is the first real test of the determination of all actors to move forward towards economic reform and modernisation. Member States have drawn up their national reform programmes. The Commission is finalising its appraisal of those programmes and will report to the Spring European Council. I should like to thank the European Parliament for its support and look forward to continuing working closely with you on the growth and jobs agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary dimension of the Lisbon Agenda is not window dressing but an essential element in promoting and ensuring support for the implementation of the necessary reforms. In that sense, we can say that the revised Lisbon Agenda has already been successful. It has managed to create a common vision and a strong consensus. Nobody seriously continues to contest that the priority should be on growth for jobs. It is now time to turn words into deeds, vision into action. The message we need from the Spring European Council is that Europe has made a credible commitment to structural reforms and is determined to exploit fully all its potential for growth and more and better jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the Austrian Presidency’s willingness to inject new dynamism into the discussion of some pending proposals that are key to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, including the Services Directive. The establishment of a well-functioning internal market in the area of services is a key opportunity to free up the potential of Europe. The Commission will cooperate fully with the Presidency and Parliament to seek political agreement on directives between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that Parliament is actively preparing the ground for a balanced approach, that is to say, an approach that will apply the Treaty provisions on trade in services while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with working and employment conditions for posted workers and recognising the specific nature of services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">For this purpose, I believe the role of the European social partners can be a crucial one. We will be calling on our social partners for a joint contribution to a balanced <span class="italic">and</span> ambitious solution for the services sector. Let us be frank about this: the services sector and small and medium-sized enterprises are the most important drivers for the creation of jobs in Europe. They should receive the support they deserve from political leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress on the revised Lisbon Agenda will have to factor in the work undertaken as a follow-up to the Hampton Court meeting. This covers key areas like research and development, universities, demographic change, energy, migration, security and the role of Europe in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will propose new initiatives in the fields of research and education, preparing the establishment of a European institute of technology and furthering work on the mutual comparability and recognition of qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">We will provide a focus for debate on demographic change and on its implications for a fairer work/life balance. We shall also present a roadmap for gender equality which will look at different European Union policies and see how they can contribute to reducing gender gaps in employment or unemployment conditions and to addressing the phenomenon of violence against women and trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">We will seek to strengthen the effectiveness of the European Union in pursuing its external objectives and interests by increasing the coherence of our action. Energy issues mark the debut of this Presidency, and I want to thank the Austrian Presidency for its excellent cooperation in dealing with the recent gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Energy issues will remain a dominant theme of our future agenda. The recent crisis and persistently high oil prices teach a lesson to those who normally resist and obstruct the provision of a European dimension for energy policy and to all those who always resist a European dimension in politics and policy-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must have an improved, more coordinated energy policy based on the principles of diversification of sources, security of supply and sustainability. Well before Hampton Court, when leaders clearly stressed the need for a new approach, the Commission announced a green paper on secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy. We are also preparing a series of new initiatives on energy efficiency and clean technologies. We will take up the debate initiated with the Biomass Action Plan and complement it with a communication on biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will put forward ideas for developing a real pan-European energy market, enhancing cooperation with our neighbouring countries. This is an example of common sense driving a common approach, where no option should be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">National leaders and citizens see the sense of a common, coherent European policy. Now is the moment for the European institutions to play their role with ambition and rigour. I look forward to working with you over the coming months to give shape to European energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to another important point. The Commission has presented sustainable development as an overarching objective and, last December, presented a communication on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy. We welcome the fact that the Austrian Presidency has chosen to put that at the top of its priorities. This will provide the momentum needed to complete the preparation of a new European Union Sustainable Development Strategy. The Commission document is an ambitious and concrete one. It offers a long-term vision for addressing issues such as climate change, preservation of natural resources, social exclusion and world poverty. It sets clear objectives, realistic targets and procedures for monitoring and measuring progress. It identifies involving all stakeholders – not only institutions, but business too – in a real partnership as a priority. Regional authorities and citizens should work together to deliver concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that will remain high up on the European agenda in the coming months is security. I am pleased to see that the priorities of the Austrian Presidency in the area of freedom, justice and security match those of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The translation of the aid programme into practical measures remains our common priority.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of migration, we shall pursue the debate launched by the Policy Plan on Legal Migration, adopted in December 2005, and come forward with proposals on the long-term resident status of persons in need of international protection.</p>
<p class="contents">During this semester we shall also table a green paper on drugs and civil society, a proposal on the applicable law in divorce matters, and a green paper on conflict of law in the area of matrimonial property regimes. The Commission will present the first implementation report on The Hague Action Plan. We look forward to achieving significant progress on those important files during the Austrian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">One last priority that I want to comment on is our relations with our neighbours. The year 2006 will be a decisive period. In the spring, the Commission will review the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in preparing for accession and assess the level of their readiness to join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Western Balkans, we welcome the priority set by the Austrian Presidency. Since 2003 the countries of the Western Balkans have had a clear European perspective. That process is critical for ensuring peace and stability in Europe. The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the careful monitoring of the situation in the region and the region’s relationship with the Union. That is why I have decided personally to visit the region in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe also needs to prepare to take greater responsibility in Kosovo. As discussions on Kosovo’s future status reach a critical stage, the European Union has to show that it is able to bring a concrete contribution to a complex and delicate issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, Heads of State and Government launched a period of reflection on the future of Europe. Citizens, civil society and political actors are expressing and debating their views, expectations and ideas. The Commission is playing its part fully, implementing Plan ‘D’ for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate. I am pleased to report that members of the Commission made a total of 68 visits to national parliaments in the course of 2005, explaining our policies and their added value to European citizens, and listening, because a process of dialogue is not just about explaining; it is also, and above all, about listening to the message citizens give to us. The European Parliament, with its counterparts in the national parliaments, is putting its weight behind this debate. The Commission is ready to cooperate fully with its initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">European leaders before us were prepared to dream of what could be. They had the courage of their European convictions. They opened a pathway to reconciliation and progress for Europe which none had walked before. Today we are the beneficiaries of that legacy and of their foresight. However, at a time when past achievements and current freedoms are so easily discounted, we cannot take future public consent for granted. It must be earned.</p>
<p class="contents">My vision is of a stronger Europe which provides a solid political, economic and social framework for our citizens, a Europe based on culture, a Europe based on common values. It is of a Europe of democracy, accountability and transparency. In our troubled world today, we more than ever need a strong European Union, a European Union which promotes security, human rights and respect for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the June European Council, the Commission will take stock of the preliminary results of the public debate and of discussions under Plan ‘D’. We also intend, at the request of the Austrian Presidency, to propose an agenda for further debate and action at European level. This will provide a basis for the Heads of State and Government to determine the way forward for the Union with a renewed commitment to translate our common objectives into actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s main asset is a core of common values and a rich culture which should inspire our reflection on the future of Europe. Institutions are important, of course they are, but institutions are instruments for achieving our goals and we should not forget the main goals of our project. We need to provide determined leadership and reinforced consensus to bring Europe forward together. We need to concentrate on the essentials. We need to focus on delivery. We need to communicate our public purpose in plain and meaningful terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying, as I told Chancellor Schüssel when I and other commissioners visited him in Vienna, that I think it was a great decision by the Austrian Presidency to choose all the beautiful and bright colours of Europe as its logo. I believe it is now time for us to do away with grey and black colours, to insist on the possibilities of such diversity of Europe and to use these very important six months of the Austrian Presidency to show our renewed commitment to a Europe that belongs to the future and believes in that future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying, Mr President-in-Office, that we expect a great deal of you, because, as you stated yourself, Europe needs trust and progress. These great expectations we have of you and your presidency are not a purely abstract wish but are based on our justifiable hope that you will perform your task wisely, in other words with both ambition and realism. I remember well when Austria held the presidency of the Council in 1998. Your country’s leaders, and you in particular, are convinced Europeans whose commitment to Europe is about action rather than mere rhetoric, and you are competent too. I hope and believe that, at the end of this half-year, we shall be able to say that yours was a successful presidency. It is still too early to pass judgment, of course, but the basic conditions are favourable.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned something that I believe to be the key principle for Europe, namely that public trust in the European institutions must flow from the mutual trust between heads of government. I am truly hopeful that you will manage to portray the European Council and the governments as a decisive body that is also united in its desire to move Europe forward, thereby dispelling the impression that all heads of government are unable to look beyond their countries’ perceived national interests and will be the ruination of Europe. In the European Council, we must begin to act for Europe on the basis of mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe must know that there can be no response to the great challenges of the present day without Europe. Europe is not the answer to every problem, but the great challenges will not be met without it. The President of the Commission said that the European institutions are a means to an end. Yes, that is true, and it means that we need the European institutions to ensure that some governments do not take it upon themselves to dictate the way forward. This is not confined to the large countries. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are opposed to a Union dominated by the large countries. At the same time, having heard the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands say, only yesterday or the day before, that the European constitution was dead, we regard that as no less a bid for dominance, implying as it does that all other countries should follow the Netherlands’ lead. We shall not accept that either.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of employment, the economy and growth. We endorse everything you said, but when we speak of support for small and medium-sized enterprises, we are not asking for subsidies. What these businesses want is relief from the burden of taxation and red tape. If we can provide that through the European and national ground rules, jobs can then be created too. This is why we say that small and medium-sized businesses should be at the heart of our thinking on economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This also means, of course, that we say ‘yes’ to European legislation, including the Services Directive. You spoke of openness and protection. That is precisely the balance we must strike. We are working on this in the European Parliament, and I hope we shall succeed in finding an acceptable solution at first reading in February.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that my Socialist friend agrees, but I would never venture to speak for his Group. He will do that himself shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of the Services Directive, I must also say that Europe’s ability to deal with the major problems arising from globalisation would be weakened in the absence of an internal market. This is why we need the single European market as a response to globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the constitution, we ask you to draw up a timetable, so that we ultimately arrive at an outcome which all countries of the European Union can support, because we – and here I am speaking for the PPE section of our Group – are firmly convinced that we need the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, energy was mentioned here. It goes without saying that the energy debate is partly about our own supply, about ourselves and our prosperity. Our prosperity will ultimately count for nothing, however, if it is not rooted in democracy. This is why we shall not tolerate a situation in which one of the G8 countries set different prices for countries such as Ukraine, which are democracies, and countries like Belarus, which is run by a ruthless dictator but gets cheaper gas. We shall not be a party to this; we want to be an advocate for all our neighbours on the basis of sound social development, on the basis of democracy, the rule of law and human dignity. We wish you every success in this effort.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Federal Chancellor – for a German Social Democrat, that form of address already has a wistfully nostalgic charm about it – I listened to you very carefully, and I must say that your speech was impressive, particularly the way it was presented. Listening to you, one has the impression that it is a real pleasure to sit on the European Council, that it is great to be President of the Council, a truly noble calling. But appearances are deceptive, as your own bitter experience has shown and as you will have realised from the outset. For this reason, we intend to look rather more closely at your role as President of this Council and at the results this Council has presented to us and then venture a comparison between what you have described as the necessary aims of your presidency and the financial reality against which these aims must be measured.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I proceed, however, there is something I have to comment upon. You must explain to me afterwards what the New Year concert had to do with the gas taps being turned off in Russia. Scarcely had the conductor raised his baton at the New Year concert, you told us, before they turned the gas down. And then the plot thickened: when the concert finished, you said, they turned it right down. We really must discuss this mysterious link between the New Year concert in Vienna and Russian gas supplies to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor, you identified three aims. You said that the people of Europe wanted growth and jobs. Yes, you are right there: growth and jobs. And the people of Europe do not want Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner to have to run round cap in hand when we want to engage in operations to stabilise the Gaza Strip, when we want to contribute to peace in the Middle East or whenever we seek to bring stability to the world’s troubled regions. It is undoubtedly correct to say that the citizens of Europe will be right behind us when the objectives adopted in Vienna last Sunday are propagated, namely an efficient fight against terrorism and an efficient European police force that can assist national police forces in combating organised crime. With measures like these, we are sure to win the backing of our citizens for the European project. That, indeed, was the reason why the European Parliament, in the Böge report on the Financial Perspective, put more growth and employment and greater security within Europe and in the wider world at the heart of its financial proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now compare our proposals with the decisions you reached in the Council – you included, Mr Schüssel – in December. For growth and employment, you proposed 35 billion less than Parliament; for internal security in the form of efficient cooperation between police forces, 7.8 billion less; for foreign policy, 12.8 billion less! In all of the areas you enumerated here as strategic tasks for your presidency, the Council made swingeing cuts, with the aid of your own vote. That is the true nature of the European crisis: your promises in the Council and the subsequent failure to deliver. That is Europe’s crisis.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, let me turn now to you. I really must say that I fail to understand you. To loud applause in this House, you encouraged the British presidency of the Council to proceed in the very direction I have just described, which is, after all, our common policy. And in your budget proposal you called for even more money. Your Commission requested EUR 1 022 billion as the funding required for the performance of our tasks over the next seven years. At the end of the day, this is whittled away to 862 billion, a shortfall of 160 billion, which you then describe as a great success. That is what I cannot understand. We want an agreement, Mr Schüssel. We want Europe to be structured efficiently. It need not always involve more money. If no more resources can be mobilised, we have to accept that. But the expenditure structures must then be organised in such a way that the aims you described can be achieved. What we have achieved is an unchanged budgetary structure. Moreover, we now have Blair’s theorem, which has taken its place alongside that of Pythagoras. Tony Blair should truly be nominated for the Nobel Prize in mathematics for his theorem, which states that the decelerated increase of a sum is equal to the reduction of the sum – brilliant!</p>
<p class="contents">Since this year marks the 250th anniversary of Mozart’s birth, Chancellor, I reflected on the words of Osmin in his aria in Mozart’s marvellous opera <span class="italic">Die Entführung aus dem Serail – The Abduction from the Seraglio – </span>which are actually a good description of what the Council has been serving up to us. Osmin sings the following line, which fits the European Council like a glove: ‘All your tricks and all your wiles, all your schemes and all your guiles, there’s none that I know not.’</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, however, must add the next part of the stanza: ‘But better ones are needed ere your victory’s conceded, for well I know what’s what’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is ready to pursue with you the aims you have outlined, but with the necessary resources and structures. Let us negotiate on that. And you are right, Mr President of the Commission, when you say that Europe needs less grey and black. Europe also needs more red!</p>

You have sketched for us a clear picture of your Presidency and you have mapped the contours of your summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Your main task over these six months will be to reach agreement with this House on the Union’s seven-year spending plans. As one of the backers of the bid to slash the budget, you have belaboured the Union with its lowest capability ever. This budget will meet not even the demands of Europe’s leaders, let alone the ambitions of our citizens. That is why Liberals and Democrats will vote today to reject the deal brokered by Mr Blair.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are to rebuild confidence in the European project, you need to convince Europeans that the EU works to serve their interests. The Erasmus Programme is one of our most visible and successful projects, yet the Council is seeking to cut the budget for young people. The Airbus project is a triumph of common endeavour, yet there will be too little money for research and development to replicate it. We trust the Council will show willingness to work with this House to redirect money towards priorities like research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year, large sums are under-spent or decommitted in areas like agriculture or the structural funds. These should be kept for EU priorities, not refunded to Member States. Likewise, the budget should be based on the actual percentage of GNI, rather than nominal figures. With growth just half a percent greater than forecast, for example, 1.045% of GNI could be worth almost EUR 16 billion more. Should the Lisbon Agenda truly succeed in making us more competitive, that figure could be even larger. Can we count on you to study ideas like these for the Interinstitutional Agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats look forward to working with you for greater economic competitiveness and more jobs. You have described this as ‘the most urgent task of European policy’. But this means embracing the opportunities offered by the EU, not shrinking under pressure from protectionists.</p>
<p class="contents">In a wider Union, the gates of Vienna are no longer under siege, nor is your way of life threatened by the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, 2006 is the European Year of Workers’ Mobility. How ironic, then, that you seek to prolong – for the first time in EU history – transitional arrangements which hinder the free movement of workers within our Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats reject a two-tier Europe in which citizens of the new Member States are treated as second class. Moreover, Europe’s entrepreneurs need all the skilled help they can get in the absence of a consensus on immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Was it not the celebrated Austrian Simon Wiesenthal who said: ‘Freedom is not a gift of heaven, you have to fight for it every day’? Liberals and Democrats agree. And we trust you will maintain our commitment to individual liberties and human rights in a world where they are increasingly trodden under foot.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us ensure that the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna becomes a fully-fledged human rights agency.</p>
<p class="contents">And press for a world-wide Human Rights dialogue to tackle the death of democracy in Russia, the fetters on freedom in China and the hypocrisy of an American President who kills Pakistani villagers in the name of democracy and civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Austria’s Presidency could be a service to Europe, and to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">If you uphold the promise of transparency made in December and start holding Council meetings in public, citizens will better understand the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If you can rediscover 1998’s ‘Pörtschachsgeist’ and set a positive agenda for action Liberals and Democrats will applaud your efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">If you work with us and your colleagues to put the constitutional debate back on the rails you will breathe hope into the Union’s affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish you courage and accomplishment in the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that case you will surely forgive me a few body checks.</p>
<p class="contents">We all claim to be honest, and we are certainly all trustworthy – no doubt about that. My friend Albert Einstein told me the following about quantum theory: if the important thing is to ask the right question, he said, you must always try to find out what has been left out of the question, because that is the important thing at the end of the day. I shall therefore follow Einstein’s advice and say this to you: of course you are an honest broker, and of course every country should organise its energy provision as it sees fit. The problem is: where do we set our research priorities? Do we give precedence to the old energy source known as nuclear energy or to research into (a) renewables and (b) hydrogen obtained from solar power? They cannot both be research priorities. Given a choice between water and coal, we cannot choose both. You can have your cake, or you can eat it. It is high time you announced what you yourself wanted rather than simply saying you will go along with whatever the others want.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of small and medium-sized enterprises, I agree with you, but at some stage a decision will have to be taken here too. We say yes to flexibility, but also to security. It would be wrong for us to organise a society in which those who have difficulties with flexibility must also pay the price of insecurity. In short, we must decide on a system that guarantees both flexibility and security. You did not say that.</p>
<p class="contents">You went on to tell us that we need a market in Europe. Wonderful! We are for that too. You also spoke of the Services Directive. Interestingly, there is one thing that neither you nor your political ally Mr Poettering mentioned, and I should like to hear what you have to say about it. I refer to the country-of-origin principle. No one is questioning the principle of freedom to provide services in Europe. What we are questioning is a country-of-origin principle that will destroy social justice in the Member States. Are you for it or against it? You have not told us. That is the problem with social justice: it shows that there is actually a difference between Right and Left in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to growth. You rightly referred to training and qualifications. The European Union, of course, is not responsible for education, but it can disseminate good practice. I long for a presidency that will finally get together with the Commission to examine the education system in Europe and conclude, as did the neo-liberal OECD, that the German and Austrian systems are the pits, because they simply do not guarantee equality. This is not Cohn-Bendit speaking but the OECD in its Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study. It is time we understood that. Germany’s so-called performance-based system is a disgrace and needs to be reviewed at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to what you did not say, Mr President-in-Office. I should like to know one thing about the European way of life: the European way of life is effectively synonymous with European law. Is it possible that there are institutions in this world – the CIA, to be precise – that operate in Europe in a legal framework that has nothing to do with the European way of life? What contribution will the presidency make to support the Committee of Inquiry of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe and to spell out to the United States and the rest of the world that Europe is not a place where any imperial power can feel free to do as it likes. And I should also like to hear what conflicts Europe is prepared to risk to defend its way of life. As you see, my friend Albert Einstein was right: a lot of probing is needed when someone does not speak about certain things.</p>

You have inherited a minefield. Good luck! Some of your predecessors saw their image go from one of triumphant self-confidence to one of pitiful weakness, all in the space of six months. You are embarking on your Presidency with more modesty, and I think you are right to do so. I will dwell only on one passage from your memorandum. When you mention the debate on the Constitution, you write in paragraph 8: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE) </span>We are trying to restore a higher level of receptiveness to people’s concerns about the preservation of the European way of life in the context of globalisation. It is a matter of rebuilding trust in the Union’s political decision-makers. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>There lies the rub, in fact. Yet in the current climate of the people’s disaffection with the European institutions, words are no longer enough: practical, clear and convincing acts are required. As an illustrious ancestor used to say: ‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating’. With this in mind, I can see no more meaningful a gesture right now than that of a clear and public call for the rejection or the definitive withdrawal of the draft Services Directive and of any other text drawing its inspiration from the same liberal principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Thursday, my group brought together in Brussels, to discuss the future of Mr Bolkestein’s symbolic text, more than 200 social actors from throughout the Union, from the confederal secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation to the representatives of the social forum from Poland and Romania, in addition to a large number of local, regional and national elected representatives. All of them expressed their strong opposition to the Commission’s text, which was described as being very dangerous by the leaders of the ETUC, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schüssel, you yourself took note at Hampton Court, in October, of the phenomenal way in which this draft directive attracted real opposition in the majority of our countries, once our fellow citizens became aware of its content. According to some indiscreet sources, you said: ‘We cannot save it; we must withdraw it’. In our opinion, withdrawing the text is actually the path we should be taking, but not with a view to coming back with a new and slightly amended draft - a ‘watered-down Bolkestein’, as one of the leaders of ATTAC described it during our meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, this matter has served to reveal what an increasing number of Europeans no longer want: workers being pitted against one another, and their social benefits and rights being levelled down as a consequence. It is this same logic that is rejected by all the port workers throughout the Union, irrespective of which trade union they belong to. The same goes for the Swedish workers involved in the very symbolic Vaxholm case. Other similar reports are reaching us from countries such as Finland, Scotland and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">As the years have gone by, we have surreptitiously gone from having European integration achieved through harmonisation of national legislation - that is to say through political acts and through votes, which at least gave us hope that we could harmonise from the top down – to integration achieved through the market, that is to say through unfettered competition, which naturally tends to lead to a levelling down.</p>
<p class="contents">You will not gain the confidence of Europeans, Mr President, without making a clean break with this liberal way of thinking, so as to really place the employee and the citizen – and no longer the market – at the centre of the European project. It is primarily in this light that your Presidency will be judged in six months’ time.</p>

However, I can assure you that you are our second choice. We are very grateful to you for your thoughts that somehow the Constitution is not dead, but presumably merely sleeping. Presumably you think that it will be brought back to life at any time, which according to the press shocked even Mr Barroso from his extended period of reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">So carry on as best you can! Never mind the fact that 70% of your own people in Austria do not approve of the way you have been talking this morning. Never mind that two-thirds of the British people cannot see any benefit in remaining part of this sham Parliament. Never mind about the ‘no’ vote in France; never mind about the ‘no’ vote in Holland. From your lofty position your disdain for democracy will be noticed and, I am sure, approved of in many sections of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, on a more mundane level, this is becoming a very expensive club to belong to. Never mind that during the season of goodwill Mr Blair comes along and contributes so much money – GBP 7 billion – that his would-be successor now wishes to have a national patriotic ‘Britain Day’ day to try and undo the damage to the perception of the British people. We have a 63% increase in our budget over seven years, and the Working Time Directive is to be brought in, so we cannot even create that wealth.</p>

Citizens must have confidence in a Europe which, as everyone knows, needs not just a common foreign policy, but also – and urgently – a revitalised economic policy, which today is shamefully lacking in respect of the twin needs of restoring competitiveness and not losing the social entitlements that underpin the very existence of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has to rediscover the strength and willpower to make its institutions and its citizens work together. The only thing that we really have in common today – and then only in 12 countries – is our monetary policy, which is in fact determined by the Central Bank without sufficient political interaction with the other institutions. We shall have to debate that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the Austrian Presidency’s commitment to resuming our journey towards the Treaty – with the tickets needed, we hope, to make it a smoother and more feasible ride. We look beyond the wishful thinking and dreams, which are often divorced from the reality that we have to deal with, but in any case there is an ability to dare. It is important to be able to predict the future realistically and not merely to manage the present. The commitment to a more united Europe in which the various institutions’ powers are more clearly defined, to a Europe that is more active and closer to its citizens, should see us united and also determined to address three further problems: immigration, energy and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">On immigration we need a common policy in order to tackle both the humanitarian aspects of the current situation and the threat of international terrorism, which is often brought in with the flows of migrants. There can only be civilised and worthwhile coexistence leading to true integration so long as non-EU nationals, no matter where they come from, respect the laws and constitutions of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Without energy there can be no development, just as wasting energy causes irreparable damage. Energy cannot be separated from security, waste disposal and environmental protection as a common good and a prerequisite for our very survival. The Member States’ finance ministers have not yet taken an active part in tackling the problems associated with climate change, despite the many economic consequences that climate change will have.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that during the Austrian Presidency we shall also see the finance and planning ministers working on this problem and thinking about the costs in terms of human lives, housing, agriculture and the countryside, as well as reconstruction costs, which the world has had to pay following the recent disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">A common environmental policy is needed within the Union, just as it is also needed by the Union in relation to the rest of the world, because it is one of the duties and objectives that we set ourselves during the Convention’s work on the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the Presidency’s interest in the trade and neighbourhood policies. The latter ought to include compliance with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>: I refer to the recent inaccurate – not to say incorrect or false – statements made by a Croatian Government representative. With regard to trade policy, we must remember to call for human rights to be respected wherever they are not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us continue in that vein. Like many other people, I am convinced that Europe would be better off if you were seated on the other side this morning, if you were President of the Commission rather than just the temporary President of the Council. In the very limited time at your disposal, you cannot hope to perform any great exploits, but it is certainly possible to set the tone in areas such as energy and subsidiarity. In the financial realm too, you can achieve something. But please do not let yourself be led astray by those with a historically proven inability to handle money. Do not believe that more money automatically brings better results. The money is actually there. We do have EUR 112 billion. The only question is what is done with it. You said yourself, Chancellor, that the question was the most important thing. You said yourself that trust had to be built up. Do that! Take real action! Say who gets what, who pays for what, from the European pots of money.</p>
<p class="contents">How many euros have the influential banking and media mogul Christian Konrad and his friends already received in support payments for things like hunting grounds? How many euros do State Governor Erwin Pröll, his friends and his relative, the Minister of Agriculture, receive in direct subsidies? Is it true that 427 influential farmers in Austria, almost all of whom are closely associated with your party, receive more than EUR 72 000 every year in direct subsidies? I could go on. What about Danone and France? What about Müller dairy products and Germany? What about the corporations governed by public law? Open the doors! Create real transparency about who gets what. Open the Council meetings to scrutiny, so that we know how such decisions are reached. While you are restoring trust, you should concern yourself with the government broadcasting corporation ORF. What is the editor-in-chief, Werner Mück, doing there now? And what about the other retainers who keep appearing there? You have opportunities here; grasp them! Transform yourself! Put an end to the age of secrecy in Austrian domestic politics. Become a European enlightener! Many millions of European citizens will thank you for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Austrians are not the only ones who are pleased to see Wolfgang Schüssel taking over the presidency of the Council. Your priorities and political principles, Chancellor, are ours too. In the European Parliament, unlike national parliaments, we sit in a semicircle, because we need each other. Thank you for urging the institutions to enter into a new spirit of cooperation in place of instinctive confrontation and dis-coordination and day-to-day political posturing. Your speech made a refreshing change from what we have been hearing over the past few months.</p>
<p class="contents">This new approach, however, also demands mutual respect and willingness to engage in dialogue, trust each other and make compromises. The book <span class="italic">Hoffnung Europa</span>, in which you yourself wrote about the strategy of cooperation, contains the following quote from Kofi Annan: ‘We don’t need any more promises. We need to start keeping the promises we already made’. I see this as the essence of your speech. That is why we say yes to efforts to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises but no to a 70% reduction in the funding of the competitiveness and innovation programme for SMEs. We say yes to education and must therefore say no to a 40% cut in that part of the budget. We say yes to a transparent, accessible, democratic, parliamentary, socially responsible, stronger Europe, but this means that we must launch the debate on the political future of the Union and make our citizens stakeholders in Europe. We say yes to the Services Directive. Let us develop it into a showpiece of social market economics. We say yes to an EU based on the Community principle. Let us continue the development of the EU and bolster the common foreign and security policy. We must be prepared to talk and listen, because there are many tasks to accomplish.

As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, I should like to remind you of the Council’s promise to discuss in depth with this Parliament whether accession can take place in 2007, as I hope it does, or whether it will have to be deferred until 2008. We expect the presidency to honour its commitment to consult us on this matter.</p>

Tell your colleagues in the Council that it is not a matter of incorporating these countries overnight for want of any other option but rather of maintaining the vision and the possibility of accession so that young people see the logic of remaining in the region instead of depopulating it by emigrating. There are many tests to be applied. One such test concerns the way in which the countries in the region treat their minorities. For us in Parliament, the treatment of minorities is always an important factor. In this respect, Chancellor, I am already deeply disappointed. How do you intend to stand up as President of the Council for the protection of minority rights when, in your own country, you cannot persuade your coalition partner, Jörg Haider, to show a minimum of respect for the Slovenian minority in Austria by having bilingual place-name signs erected? I also hope you will make every effort, during this particular presidency, to ensure that Austria behaves in an exemplary manner, with no backsliding, not least with a view to gaining international trust.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with enlargement, we sometimes have the impression that heads of government – and you are certainly not alone in this – are very quick to take decisions. When it comes to conveying to their own population, however, why steps towards enlargement are needed and what there is to be gained from enlargement, they have very little to say. The Council must consider, together with Parliament and the Commission – for we can only do this together – how we should jointly present this great historic enlargement project to the public, because, as you rightly said, there really is a lack of trust. We must reflect together on what we can do to overcome that lack of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of economic problems and unemployment, I must give you my full support. One of the criteria by which we shall measure your performance is the way in which your welcome pledge to combat unemployment is honoured during this presidency and the extent to which you are prepared to lead the way with specific measures. In this context it is especially regrettable that, although more funds are available to us for research and development, some of these funds, as you very well know, have been siphoned off from infrastructure development. The European rail network that is so important to all of us, and particularly to our country, will suffer from the swingeing cutbacks we have made in that domain. We find this unacceptable, and we should try to make another adjustment here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, we Social Democrats shall judge your presidency objectively. We shall measure your performance by what you have promised today. We hope that the Austrian presidency will be a resounding success. Such is the importance of Europe to us that we could not wish you any less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following on from a great and almost despairing speech from the Luxembourg President of the Council half a year ago and a great demagogic address from the British President-in-Office, you have presented us with a kind of lesson in European harmony today and have tried to coax a <span class="italic">Sound of Europe </span>out of the magic political flute. This <span class="italic">Sound of Europe</span>, however, cannot obscure the reality that Europe is in crisis. Its notes cannot drown out the bickering of governments and the constant hubbub of the nationalistic horse-trading bazaar, nor can it drown out Europe’s agonised wailing as governments make it a scapegoat whenever they need one – the very Europe that those governments themselves have created.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with rapt attention and great respect when you talked about the people of Europe, for it has to be said that most governments deny the existence of a European people; it would have momentous implications for the constitutional issue if the people of Europe were taken seriously. But, to come back to something my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit mentioned, the magic flute cannot even be heard above the silence of governments – the silence of their suppressed delight at the collapse of a constitution that would have given Europe, the people of Europe, more rights but would have cost governments some of their power.</p>
<p class="contents">You are not to be seen in the front line when the time comes to break a lance for European democracy: silence on social issues, Chancellor, and lessons in harmony. The European way of life is not in danger. It is not your responsibility anyway. It has many facets. People create the European way of life themselves. What is in danger, though, is the European social model, the social market economy. Not a word did you say about that. It is not for freedom that we need a magic flute. But your cooperation in the CIA affair, in a monstrous assault on fundamental rights at the heart of this Europe, …</p>

It would be fair to say that two themes will dominate the Austrian Presidency: the failed constitutional process and the services directive.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it quite simply, the Dutch and French people have pronounced the Constitution dead; having been rejected by two Member States, it is no longer an issue, and the sooner the European Union can admit this, the sooner we can start the necessary reforms: reducing EU interference in matters of national responsibility, stopping the money wasting and fraud in Europe and carrying out a real democratisation process in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the services directive, Austria is seeking a compromise between the different camps. If, however, it is the intention to strike a compromise between multinationals on the one hand and trade unions on the other, this will always result in a deterioration of the working conditions in Europe. Moreover, it will be impossible to compromise on the core of the proposal, namely the country-of-origin principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Since my party and my group reject competition in the area of working conditions or social dumping as Europe’s future, we also reject the proposed directive. Europe did not want a Constitution; it does not want this services directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Presidency could end up in the history books as the first presidency to really listen to what the people want. If, however, a decision is made in favour of ramming a constitution and this services directive down people’s throats, then this will only strengthen the opposition to European cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have called for the city of Trieste to be considered the capital of the Europe of regions, since it is a city symbolising a Europe of different ethnic groups and of civilised coexistence among its various peoples. On the subject of people’s rights, I should like to mention the presence here outside Parliament of people from Istria, Dalmatia and Fiume. I wish to draw attention to the fact that their right to their property has again been trampled underfoot, even though the 1947 peace treaty provided for its protection. They are still here! Chancellor Schüssel, I shall give you a dossier on this long-standing and highly sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us uphold people’s rights and not allow Europe to be a Europe of Brussels technocrats.

<p class="contents">In so doing, it would be wrong to avoid the key question, which is what the end result of this European integration process is supposed to be: a federal superstate with centralist tendencies, to which the abortive constitutional treaty would inevitably have led, or a confederation of states, a Europe of the nations.</p>

You take over the Council Presidency at an important time and, in the wake of the opportunities wasted by the British Presidency, you now have the chance to make real progress in a number of key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the economic reform agenda will be taken forward with some urgency. It stalled under the last Presidency and I urge you not to be deflected from pursuing the case for reform. I am somewhat concerned about the issue of the Services Directive, on which I believe you are planning some changes, and about your plans to coordinate social security systems. I hope you will not do anything that would damage the prospects of economic progress under such measures. I also ask you not to change the Working Time Directive opt-out which, certainly from a UK perspective, has been fundamental to that country’s economic wellbeing of late.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome your call for a serious discussion on the role of the European Court of Justice. That is an extremely important debate because the Court has seemed in recent years to extend European competences into areas where there was decidedly no European law. It is therefore a timely debate and one which I am very pleased will take place.</p>
<p class="contents">You have made a number of comments on the European Constitution. I wish to make it clear that we truly believe it would be sensible for the Constitution not to be resurrected at present. The remarks by the Dutch Foreign Minister cannot be ignored. The citizens of Europe do not want a more centralised State and they do not want a centralised Europe. At Laeken, at the beginning of the Convention process, the leaders stated that they wanted to reconnect the EU and its institutions with the people. The Constitution failed to do that. However, the people do want a Europe that deals with jobs, economic growth, the environment, and cooperation in fighting crime and terrorism. We must break out of the tired debate on institutions and constitutions. Let us focus on those areas in which the EU can add value to people’s quality of life and living standards.</p>

I sincerely hope, Chancellor, that with your negotiating skills you will show the necessary flexibility in the forthcoming negotiations with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman of my Group also underlined, as you did, how important it is for this spring Presidency to promote more growth and more jobs. I noted that you said that a possible perspective might be 3% growth and 1% reduction in unemployment in the coming years. This is a marvellous perspective and one that I endorse, but we need to use the right tools to achieve this target. Let us do it, but let us use the right tools to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I sent you a proposal a few days ago on a new growth strategy which the Socialist Group and the party share. Mr Schulz and I were in London just a day before Hampton Court, and there the Socialist leaders, presidents and prime ministers decided unanimously to bring before the European Union a new common growth strategy, recognising that we cannot achieve it merely by means of a European Union directive – we do not have the necessary competences. But we can do it together in a freely decided intergovernmental decision at the forthcoming spring Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that you share this vision brought to you by the Socialist governments of Europe and that you will bring the forces on the other side together, whether they be grey or of any other colour. It is the results that count, as you said. This growth strategy has shown that if we boost growth as a combination of reforms and guided demand on intelligent investment in education, in active labour market policy, in child care, in research, in small and medium-sized firms, then we can do it. But what we need are common decisions at the spring Council and guarded and guided decisions over the next three to four years.</p>
<p class="contents">I asked Commission President Barroso a couple of weeks ago whether we can do it. Could we make a new deal as a new start for the spring summit? I got the impression, Mr Barroso, that you said ‘let us give it a try’. You have the opportunity, and if you do it, not only will the people of Europe hear the sound of Europe, but we will hear the voice of the people and then they will begin to listen to us. And then they will be ready to discuss a new treaty for Europe. Is that not worthwhile? I think it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first relates to the protection of minorities. We ethnic Austrians living in the Southern Tyrol/Alto Adige region have always received a great deal of understanding and support from Vienna. Let Austria be equally magnanimous towards the minorities within its own boundaries, such as the Carinthian Slovenes. What is happening at the present time in the dispute over place-name signs in Carinthia is grotesque.</p>
<p class="contents">The second relates to ratification of the Transport Protocol to the Alpine Convention. If Austria does not settle this matter, which has long been a concern of the Alpine countries, who will?</p>
<p class="contents">The third relates to the need to prevent the construction of the Brenner base tunnel. Building a high-speed railway through the Alps is very hazardous for many reasons: mixed traffic on the old line and on the projected new line, high-speed passenger trains travelling through so many and such long tunnels, goods traffic on the Alpine railway, which would cause unreasonable nuisance to those who live nearby, and the premature construction of the tunnel complex itself without the simultaneous construction of the feeder lines. This new megaproject would be even more unprofitable than the Eurotunnel under the English Channel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps we shall now have hard and fast policies in place of all the air bubbles we had during the British presidency. Yet even so, Mr Schüssel, the programme for your presidency of the EU is alarming, especially in the field of foreign and military policy. On the one hand, we are told that the next steps with regard to the Treaty on a Constitution for Europe must be openly discussed. That is all very well, but the present constitutional treaty is dead. All we need now, essentially, is a date for the burial. On the other hand, some parts of the constitutional treaty which are needed for the pursuit of the Union’s military policy are simply being applied without ratification. This programme for the domain of military policy poses particular problems for a neutral country. Let me cite two examples: firstly, efforts are to be made to have the battle groups combat-ready by 1 January 2007; secondly, special priority is to be given to the so-called European Defence Agency.</p>

<p class="contents">Does the Presidency’s proposed work programme reflect the essential tasks for the European Union? In my view, the Presidency has pointed out accurately enough those problems which, unresolved, make it difficult to conceive of further successful development of the European Union. Clear answers must be found to the fundamental questions concerning the limits of the European Union’s enlargement and the extent of integration. This would make it possible to return to the debates on the Constitution with an altered level of mutual understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">In the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy now is the last chance to match the intensity of day-to-day activities with the deadlines for its completion. A decision regarding the liberalisation of the services sector would not only open up new sources of economic activity within the context of the European Union market, but would also be the most significant support for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises that the European Union can provide.</p>
<p class="contents">Strategic decisions in the field of security of energy supply are also a pressing task, in order to direct business research and infrastructure development activities into a strategic channel without delay.

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, six months may be long enough to point out the appropriate direction for this change and rectification that the European Union requires. I am therefore simply going to talk about two urgent issues which I believe are facing the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, having heard all of us, Chancellor, you will see that the European Union has no problem with words, since almost all of us are asking for the same thing: more Europe and the incorporation of real problems into the operation of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is not one of words, but one of attitudes. Every institution must adjust its attitude again and again when dealing with issues affecting Europeans. When the day comes when the European Parliament does not examine what the President-in-Office of the European Council is doing but rather what the Heads of Government that are not holding the Presidency are doing in the Councils, we shall undoubtedly be dealing with one of the problems of the European Union, which is the lack of tenacity, the lack of constant work on the part of all of the governments, even though they may not be holding the Presidency of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Chancellor, within a few years, Europeans are going to have to identify and acknowledge the European Union’s political role in relation to the great problems facing us: energy, immigration, terrorism, growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, Europeans do not know what the European Union is doing on any of these issues; they do not evaluate, they do not criticise, they do not judge, because they do not know what the European Union is doing in these areas. We need to do some political work in order to make the public aware of what the European Union and its institutions are doing in these fields. That is the second great urgent issue facing the Union, Chancellor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some other Members have taken up that theme. With all due respect to Mozart, a different Austrian and European whose birth we commemorate this year would probably be more useful to us in providing therapy for Europe’s ailments. I am thinking here of Sigmund Freud, whose work included the study of inferiority complexes, frustration and narcissism, all of them conditions which seem to affect the European psyche. We have many inferiority complexes. You referred yourself to the European way of life. That is primarily a model built on social justice, a model we should be exporting. We should not be importing neo-liberal models into Europe from other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to you, Mr President-in-Office, to seek musical harmony with Condoleezza Rice and the Bush Administration but not to sing from their political song sheet. Represent Europe self-confidently in the world. Frustration, as we know from Freud, derives from unfulfilled expectations. These are something that Europe provides all too often. For example, we promise thirty priority transport projects, and then a Financial Perspective is adopted which makes it impossible to fund these projects from either European or national resources. In Austria itself, your own Deputy Chancellor has already written off a project to which I attach great importance, namely the rail link between Prague and Linz.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this, I believe, has to do with another condition that is especially prevalent in the European Council, namely narcissism and excessive egocentricity, which repeatedly prevent us from bringing Europe any further forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only are there far more countries around the table, but there are bigger differences between us in terms of prosperity. We must find a replacement for the present method of funding, which involves contributions from the national exchequers. Each country attaches far too much importance to its net contribution, rather than looking at the bigger picture.

I expect you finally to pluck up the courage to tell our citizens, loud and clear, that the text being foisted upon them by the politicians is impenetrable, iniquitous and, more importantly, does not in any way solve the crisis currently facing the European Union. There is in fact a precedent for European integration, an important foundation on which Austria can base this announcement to our citizens. Less than a hundred years ago, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was a unique confederation with common ministries for foreign affairs, war and finance, as well as a High Court of Auditors. It was made up of 21 European countries, in which the citizens spoke a number of languages, and it lasted for 51 years. What was its undoing? Nobody had the courage to solve the kind of problems that such co-existence naturally brings. Politicians believed that problems would simply disappear of their own accord over time; and we know what came of that. I therefore hope, Mr President, that Austria will not take the same route as its predecessors, but will instead advocate that the European Constitution be recast in such a way that it is workable, concise, comprehensible and just. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union is faced, in fact, with a major attack from within and just as dangerous a threat from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">The attack from within is coming from those who do not believe, or no longer believe, in the fundamental role that Europe can and must play. They are riding on a credibility crisis that has alienated too many citizens from institutions that they consider distant and governed by an all-powerful but inept bureaucracy. Europeans want a political Union that can solve those problems of theirs to which Member States and local bodies are unable to provide answers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must work for a more political Europe that reaches out to take care of people’s interests. We need a strong commitment to economic growth, which will create jobs; we need aid for small and medium-sized enterprises – as you mentioned – as well as budget reform and measures to address the important issue of immigration. There is also a need for a Constitution to enable us to attain these objectives, to simplify the legislative process, and to guarantee the continuity of political action.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that we can make progress in that direction over the next six months, and we look forward with confidence to 2007, when the German Presidency will happily coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Community Treaties and we can make constructive choices for the future of Europe. The Constitution is not dead: having it enter into force is a fundamental objective for us to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">The threat from outside is that of terrorism. We have to defend ourselves by enhancing internal cooperation, not only through judicial and policing initiatives, but above all by means of political action to make the Union a key player in bringing peace to the Middle East. The war on terrorism is waged primarily in that part of the world. Guaranteeing security for Israel and creating a Palestinian state are the keys to seeing freedom and peace triumph over violence and fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor, <span class="italic">Forza Italia</span> and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorse the Austrian Presidency’s proposals to revitalise Europe’s role and to close the gap between the Union’s institutions and its citizens.

The difference is that we also have to try, within the framework of a voluntary Interinstitutional Agreement between Parliament and the Council, to lay down common rules for a period of seven years governing both the volume of resources and their use. Since this is a voluntary agreement between two institutions, it is hardly surprising that one of the institutions is not prepared simply to accept the figures adopted at a summit meeting of the other institution on the basis of an assurance that the latter had gone as far as it could and that there was no more to be had. That would be the last straw! Any Parliament that relied on such an assurance would be jeopardising one of its fundamental rights and reneging on its corresponding legal and practical responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a close look at your figures. We adopted the budget for 2006 only a few weeks ago. It amounts to 1.09% of GNP. In the Council, you said we should have to make do in future with 1.045%, which is considerably less. At the same time, we have major tasks ahead of us that have to be accomplished. These, however, can either not be adequately funded from a budget of this size, which would mean disappointing people, or else we must think of ways to achieve greater flexibility, so that we can keep our promises. Your pruning strategy gives us decisions to take. In which areas do you actually want to make cuts? In the fight against terrorism? I have heard that Europol is to be reinforced. In the realm of air safety, for which we are setting up an agency? I do not believe we can afford to make any savings in these areas. What about exchanges of school pupils, students and trainees, who travel to other European countries to develop their own skills, work in a European environment and make themselves competitive in years to come? Surely these exchanges are essential!</p>
<p class="contents">Research, you said, should be a national responsibility. Satellite navigation, large-scale lasers, neutron sources, genome banks: should research in all of these fields be limited to national efforts? I do not think that is the way forward. We have done a great deal of work here to put a good proposal on the table. We shall negotiate responsibly with you, in a spirit of mutual trust, to determine what is possible. As Europeans, however, I believe we, all of us, should consider what this Europe is actually worth to us. Before any figures in billions are bandied about, let me say that I worked this out for the other German Members and myself. Our proposal means that every German would have to spend ten euros a month in future to make all these things happen. Anyone out there who says that we are utterly irrational in the European Parliament or that we are overshooting the mark really has no idea what Europe is worth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore have some specific questions. What, in practical terms, does the Presidency intend to do for small and medium-sized enterprises? You say that you intend to create jobs through energy policy. Can you explain how? Do you intend to support voluntary or compulsory targets where alternative energy and biomass are concerned? That is also a very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well-known, it is easier to fight for one’s principles than to live up to them. You talk a lot about the environment and consumer power. I therefore wish to ask, on the subject of the Chemicals Directive, whether you will fight to ensure that it is possible to replace the most dangerous chemicals of all and whether you will improve the Council agreement reached in December? Will you add the right for the consumer to know which dangerous chemicals the product contains?</p>

<p class="contents">The UK Presidency was all about fine speeches. Your own Presidency has to be all about action. Humble proposals and effective action are required. What Europeans expect from you is not more flowery rhetoric and endless broken promises; they expect real practical action relevant to everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">I approve of your desire to restore confidence among Europeans, but you will forgive me if I am still sceptical. I will take just the one example, which is particularly close to my heart: paediatric medicines. Today, our children have very few medicines developed specially for them. We can conclude this matter as quickly as possible. Our Parliament voted at first reading, and the Council gave its political agreement, but the common position seems to be held up for unjustified reasons. I am waiting for you personally, Mr Schüssel, to make a commitment - before us in this Chamber - to make this text a priority with a view to bringing it to fruition under your Presidency. I am concerned because I have not, in your programme, found the slightest mention of this extremely important matter, which is designed to benefit our children and which shows everyone the added value contributed by Europe. I await your support and, in return, you will be able to count on my determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schüssel, restoring the European Parliament’s confidence in the Council will be a hard task because Europe cannot survive without a real budget. There is so much that we need to do, build and develop and so much that we need to bring to each citizen. Well, with what the Council is proposing – with this poor Council agreement on the financial perspective – we can, as it were, stop our parliamentary activities immediately, shut up shop and go on holiday. Keep that squarely in mind.</p>

If the seven-year draft budget is not in place, we will lose two thirds of our assistance, and if the draft is delayed any longer, we will not be able to prepare for the large structural and cohesion projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is very important to have a better budget, but we would like to preserve all the positive, significant opportunities given to new Member States in December in respect of the utilisation of structural and cohesion funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Constitution, this was the first enlargement that had not been preceded by deepening. Deepening cannot be achieved without the Constitution, and you can count on Hungary in this respect; two states cannot block 23 others.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the competitiveness of the European Union, the Services Directive and the liberalisation of the free movement of labour are indispensable. In Ireland, for instance, unemployment did not rise, but actually fell following liberalisation of the free movement of labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as a Hungarian, I am very pleased that you are dealing with the Balkans, because there is a great danger: if the status of Montenegro and Kosovo is not settled by the European Union, there will be destabilisation in the West Balkans, because the Americans do not know much about minority issues.

<p class="contents">The first of these is energy security. Most of our fossil fuels come from areas suffering major political instability, such as the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria. No matter how much we reassess our reserves, and we negotiate long-term contracts, there will always be a threat to our energy supplies in Europe. The time has come to examine the nuclear option with a cool head, because otherwise we will be living with this sword dangling permanently above our heads.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue to which you referred, Mr Schüssel, was that of growth, employment, globalisation and the Lisbon Strategy. On this issue, we must once again avoid double standards. I cannot recall any European project that has not been realised, developed and monitored by the Commission. The time has come to say that this strategy, which has been pursued not on the basis of a Commission proposal but on the basis of intergovernmentalism, has stagnated and is not working. The Commission must be called upon to do more. It needs to set out and monitor a roadmap, as happened with the internal market and the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">We still believe that the notion that intergovernmentalism can help the Lisbon Strategy to thrive is deeply flawed. We must not pull the wool over the citizens’ eyes; what we should say is: give the Commission the power that it needs to help the Lisbon Strategy to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that that is a mere cliché, because in my view it represents the crux of the difference between us at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who think that we can only find a way out of this impasse by taking a leap forward along the road to integration and a political Europe, whereas others delude themselves that we can have great projects and great objectives while cutting back on Europe’s ambitions, resources and policies. That is a fallacy, a deception that we have seen before from those who actually have a hidden agenda and from those in the Member States that do not want to accept their own responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The other significant word, Mr President-in-Office, is ‘consistency’: if we want that Europe of which you have spoken, we shall need your help. Please help us – Parliament – over the coming weeks to change the financial perspective, which was the result of national fears and self-interest, and is likely to destroy Europe instead. Help us to get the constitutional process off the ground again, in order to aim for greater integration, to put the Treaty of Nice behind us as soon as possible, and to ensure that, insofar as the Treaties allow, we and the countries that so desire can at any rate press ahead with policies that are essential for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak of consistency because that is the most difficult concept to guarantee at this time. It is inconsistency, however, and those declarations that are sometimes heard even here in Parliament but are not confirmed by events, which are today the main reasons for the gap between Europe and its institutions and Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, Austria is one of those Member States who know very well what still needs to be done before we take the enlargement one step further, to ensure that the 2004 enlargement is effective, opportunities are gradually equalised and dissimilarities are reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic growth, more jobs – this is the topic of the Presidency Conference to be held in March. In order to achieve this, we expect the Austrian Presidency to ensure that Europe is not divided by unjustified or artificially induced fears. The free movement of people or services must be on the agenda. What we need is an obstacle-free common market.</p>

Regulation or a framework programme for competitiveness must be on the agenda.</p>

However, the marriage was unconsummated and broken off, which makes me a sixteenth generation French citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">I used this historical reference for the purposes of capturing your attention and of illustrating a strong argument regarding the budget. Firstly, be wary of this Parliament because it is a parliament under construction, and therefore it sometimes rebels: Mr Buttiglione did not bow down to the criticism made of him. As for the dockworkers: the intention is to serve us up the same old menu, but we are not going to eat from it and we are going to cast a simple majority vote. Be wary of this Parliament. ‘Wary’ is not the right word, but Parliament can react and it can rebel.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament therefore needs to be given a bit of money or, rather, a bit of extra money. I am going to point out a heading that I would like to see receive a bit of extra money: citizenship, youth, education and culture. Put a bit of extra money into that!</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Because, as a French citizen, what took place in my country on 29 May has left a deep impression on me. As far as I am concerned, 29 May is an historic date. It is not just any old date, and the debates in which I have participated have at times been harsh: it is all very well talking about the market and the euro, but you should put a few more resources into that heading. Do it for the sake of European awareness, because history is reversible. Any treaty that has been concluded can be broken.</p>

Europe should speak with a single common voice in all three cases, not only because what Europe says should demonstrate the ethical dimension of European foreign policy, but also to ensure that the relevant instruments are applied, even though we do not yet have a Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Two Member States of the European Union are permanent members of the UN Security Council. Four Member States of the Union belong to the G8. One of these countries ought to be authorised to represent the European Union and speak on its behalf. I hope this will come about during your term in office, Chancellor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us instead talk about what we have done and what we need to do in order to turn the relevant aims and demands into reality, by which I mean achieve European competitiveness. Otherwise, all references to the Lisbon Process will be no more than a device for distracting attention from what is not being done. Let us talk about what needs, in actual fact, to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Implement the Services Directive. That is the most practical thing we can do to strengthen European competitiveness. Ensure that it is done on the basis of a respect for European diversity that makes the most of each country’s competitiveness. That is not only the most important measure for strengthening European competitiveness, it is also the most important thing we can do to bring about the reunification of Europe and ensure that all European countries can experience growth, as well as relations unimpeded by borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensure that the long-term budget that emerges from the negotiations with Parliament is characterised by higher priority being given to research and development. This is one of the individual measures we can take that will help more than anything else to turn Europe into a leading knowledge-based society.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensure that Europe can take vigorous unified action in the context of its policy on Iran, which is at present conducting a policy that is neither acceptable in the international community nor in accordance with the demands that need to be made of every country. A country that threatens to annihilate another country, that secretly develops nuclear fuel technology and that supports terrorism must be confronted by a common unified European policy in alliance with our international partners.</p>
<p class="contents">These tasks are basically European ones that show why European cooperation is needed. The Council and the Commission have a great responsibility to ensure that policy is characterised by practical efforts to implement the relevant measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is up to you, Mr Schüssel, building on the report that is due to be issued during your period in office, to outline perspectives for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just about the European Constitution, although the fact is that Europe cannot grow any further without it. It is also about Europe’s future prosperity, growth and employment. The Council must set priorities, thus giving true shape to the Lisbon Strategy. That is also how competitiveness is strengthened and the European model of prosperity safeguarded. It is also about the future of the European social model, which Mr Schüssel was right to mention this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Six months ago, Prime Minister Blair was unstinting in his efforts to modernise the European social model. An additional summit was dedicated to it, albeit without any tangible results to show for it. No answer has been found to the challenge of globalisation and no measures have been taken to re-anchor the European social model in a society that is changing and ageing, one in which the number of young people is decreasing, and a society in which borders are no longer borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge Mr Schüssel to ensure that his presidency goes beyond fine rhetoric. Let us work together to breathe new life into our European social model, and let us then tackle those who create differences between the market and its smooth functioning on the one hand and social policy – which is so crucial to our citizens’ well-being – on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a matter of doubt that Christian Democrats, too, see the socially oriented market economy as the cornerstone of a society that builds on people. I admit that in my own circles, and among the Socialists too, free market thinking is gaining ground and that one sometimes has the feeling of being a voice in the wilderness. I hope that this presidency, along with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is set to report on this, will manage to put this on a surer foundation. I would thank the President very much for being accommodating in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I warmly welcome the fact that one of Austria’s stated priorities is to put the European Constitution back on the agenda. In this regard, however, I should like to warn of the pitfalls lying in wait along the route that the Commission – and Parliament, albeit only in part – have chosen to follow, which is to hold more and more debates on citizens’ expectations, and subsequently to prepare a new text that would seek both to resolve the issue of institutional reform and to address all of Europe’s economic, social and security-related problems. If we strike out on that path we shall be repeating the mistake that lay at the root of last year’s failed referendums, when anyone harbouring reservations over the EU’s internal policies rallied in opposition to the Constitution, irrespective of their views on the Union’s institutional framework. We made the mistake of putting forward for ratification a Constitution which, alongside the rules on the functioning of institutions, also contained a summary of all common policies.</p>
<p class="contents">What we now need, ahead of the forthcoming enlargement and in the light of ongoing changes to the international order, is to separate the constitutional framework, namely the first and second parts of the constitutional treaty, from the common policies in the third part. The first and second parts of the Constitution were not the subject of debate before the referendum, and their ratification would enable us to seek workable solutions to the most contentious issues currently affecting the continent, by reforming the rules governing institutional competencies. If we wish to solve everything in one go, we shall once again end up solving nothing. The main outcome of the Austrian Presidency should be a workable plan, whereby debate over the reform of Europe’s institutions is kept separate from the general debate on other problems affecting Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we will not be able to assess whether your presidency will have been successful until six months down the line, but in order to put you on the right track – or keep you on it, for I greatly appreciated your introduction – there are two concrete suggestions I should like to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would urge you to find a structural solution to the long-standing issue concerning the definitive list of goods and services that are eligible for the optional reduced VAT rate. We have procrastinated long enough. We must now take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The industries that are shown the carrot of the reduced rate – which includes the catering industry, but also other SME sectors – do not get what they want. Those who have emerged from the experiment with labour-intensive services, which has been extended three times, are in untenable legal uncertainty. Since I do not believe that the Commission will be able to tolerate manifest infringements of the sixth VAT directive for much longer, this strikes me as a priority area for action.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am delighted to hear that you would like to combine openness and protection in the services directive. In this House, we do not shirk the hard work either in order to reach a widely supported, positive majority. If you compare the Commission’s original proposal with the result of the work in this Parliament’s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, you will see that a different approach is possible through amendments. If the Council supports us in this long-term ambition, this delicate dossier may well be able to turn a corner under your presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the Austrian Presidency – in the service of the European Union, as you yourself have put it – much success in these two, but also in the other, items on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the budget is too small. Your country, Austria, is a member of the ‘club of six’, the ‘one per cent club’, the ‘club of penny pinchers’ which wants more Europe with less money. Yet, as the Presidency, Mr Schüssel, you must allocate more money to the Neighbourhood Policy in the East and to this new challenge constituted by EU energy security. Otherwise, we are going to rebel against the overly greedy Councils, just like Mr Poignant said. </p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Presidency’s intention to work for growth and jobs, competitiveness and the Lisbon Agenda is most laudable. Such objectives can be achieved only through the completion of the internal market. The best service we can render to Lisbon, growth and jobs is to open labour and services markets. Austria has explicitly recognised in its White Paper that the Services Directive is essential for completing the internal market and reinforcing European competitiveness. Yet when it comes to taking concrete steps to achieve the declared objectives, the Presidency’s pronouncements are much less reassuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Soon there will be an initial review of the transition period for introducing freedom of movement of workers. But Austria declared that it will use this opportunity to extend the transition period in the area of free movement of workers, and it takes the reductionist position on the free movement of services. Are Austria’s declarations as Presidency consistent with its intentions as a Member State? On the one hand, the Presidency’s declared objective is boldness in fighting for Europe’s competitiveness, on the other, Vienna strives to stifle Europe’s potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement was supposed to bring the European Union great benefits, increasing its competitiveness in global trade, largely through the influx of highly qualified, mobile and relatively cheap labour. Now, certain Member States, including Austria, regardless of the positive examples of Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden, want to forgo those crucial benefits, introducing transition periods immediately after enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This arrangement is beneficial for the European Union and also for our own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortuitously enough, the commencement of the Austrian Presidency of the Council coincides with my departure from the European Parliament at the end of ten years in which I have had the privilege of leading the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party – ten years in which the European Union has undergone drastic changes, and so have we. Pride of place among these dramatic changes goes to the enlargement of the European Union, for which I worked in many different capacities, and which has strengthened both the European Union and Austria. Our growth from 15 to 25 members is not now, any more than it was before, cause for our people to feel unsettled. It was not too rapid; it was the right response at the right time after the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new start in Europe. While a further process of growth is of course necessary, what is important is something to which I am glad that the President of the Council referred, namely the standards that we must adhere to when incorporating new members into the European Union – standards that we must take seriously, standards that we cannot and must not undermine and subvert with a nod and a wink. Europe’s growth is dependent on the fight against corruption, the fight for the rule of law and for proper, democratic and transparent administration. Both institutionally and psychologically, Europe’s businesses and industries, Europe’s people and the European Union itself must be capable of absorbing the impact of enlargement; this is a criterion that we must apply in the forthcoming enlargement rounds involving Romania and Bulgaria, both of which will, I hope, meet the requirements in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">In his speech, the President of the Council referred to a number of things that I would like to highlight. The first is that Europe needs strong own resources. If, my dear Wolfgang, you manage to inject new ideas into the European debate and get Europe to at last get down to actually having this debate on own resources, that would be a great step forward. I have to say, by the way, that I think you have enough negotiating skill to solve the major problem of the forthcoming Financial Perspective by an accommodating attitude towards the European Parliament, which will make it easier for Parliament and the Commission to draw closer to the Council on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect that I would like to highlight is one that I regard as positive, namely Europe’s need for solutions to be reached between the two sides of industry and its self-evident inability, in this dynamic and global growth process, to abandon the concept of partnership between them. That is an important and basic premise. You have seen the dockers demonstrating here; social partnership cannot be used to put the brake on economic growth, but must, on the contrary, be a motor for it. At the end of the day, Europe and the European Union do need energy, not only in the literal sense of the word, but political energy too, and so let me conclude with an appeal. We need to give more attention to the neighbourhood policy, to the policy that makes it possible for the European Union to devote its attention to a country as important as Ukraine. There can be no ‘one size fits all’ approach where this is concerned. We need to give special attention to the development of democracy in Ukraine and to that country’s economic independence. I am certain that a number of things will be done about that under this Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a need for restraint where the proliferation of nuclear weapons is concerned.</p>

Perhaps I might add that she will, in a sense, be in charge of me, as she will be a sort of Mayor of central Vienna, which makes me now one of her charges and subjects. I wish her all the best for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might, very briefly, address certain topics that have been raised in this debate. I am grateful to all those who have raised the issue of enlargement, with particular reference to the prospects for the Balkans. I shall be brief about this, for I have already been in touch with almost all the groups about it, and I know that you know that this is a high-priority issue for Austria, for the very simple reason that the Balkans are right next door to us – according to an old joke, the Balkans begin at the Rennweg in district III in central Vienna – and we are directly affected by what goes on there. If we in Europe do not export stability, we will end up importing instability. There must be no unstable zone in between Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, Italy and Greece. There must not be a grey area there, but rather a place with prospects, without which the necessary impetus for reform and the reconciliation of the various ethnic groups in Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo will not, at the end of the day, be possible. That is something that everyone must be aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with that in mind that we are committing ourselves, and we have now also given the UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari a base and an office in Vienna, where in-depth discussions are a daily occurrence. We know that this is a task for us all to perform. I might well add that the Balkans is one of Europe’s great success stories. It may well have been the Americans who defeated Milosevic by military means, but 90% of the troops keeping the peace there today are Europeans. What we present to the world there now is not the military face of the European Union, but the pacific countenance of Europe. That is something of which everyone must be made aware.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning that we are celebrating not only the 250th anniversary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s birth and 150th of Sigmund Freud’s, but also the centenary of the first award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to a woman, Bertha von Suttner. Her slogan, <span class="italic">‘Die Waffen nieder’</span> – lay down your weapons – is a real programme, and particularly relevant to the 21st century when one thinks of Iran, about which I had a conversation yesterday with Mohammed El Baradei – the IAEA, too, is based in Vienna. Iran is an issue of the utmost concern. Mr El Baradei said, in a readable interview in the latest issue of <span class="italic">Newsweek</span>, that, even after his inspectors had spent three years in intensive talks, closely examining and monitoring Iran’s nuclear programme, it was still not possible to confirm that it was peaceable in character, and that is an issue to which we will be devoting a great deal of attention over the coming months. It is not for us to make threatening gestures about it; on the contrary, we have to send a clear message from Europe that bids Iran go back to the moratorium, back to the negotiating table, with no unilateral actions that could end up putting the peace of the wider world in jeopardy, and that message must be carried by your House, by the Council, by the Commission, and by our representatives Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Javier Solana. That is the only way in which we will gain credibility in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the subject of energy, which is something else that I do not want to mince my words about. I do know, of course, that every country has its own way of dealing with this issue, but I have campaigned for every country, at the end of the day, to have freedom of choice when it comes to its means of generating energy, and even then there are a number of issues that are certainly open to debate. I personally believe that it would be very, very dangerous to go down the road that leads to a revival of nuclear power, and there are many issues around it that have not yet been resolved. It is a field in which public concern must not be underestimated. At European level, though, we can address the issue of renewable energy, about which Mr Barroso has come up with some truly first-class ideas, and biofuels, in which, might I add, the Americans are investing five times as much as Europe and its Member States combined. This is an area in which we need credibility. We have renewable resources, we have wood, we have biomass. As I see it, that presents agriculture with an opportunity over the coming years and decades. Without, of course, disregarding the need to take account of the differences that do of course exist between the Member States, this is an issue that we should address very honestly and very frankly.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue I would like to look at is that of the trans-European networks. I have been a member of the European Council for ten years; once, when I was foreign minister, I was even in charge of an Austrian Council Presidency. For ten years, we have been talking about trans-European networks, and, so far, not one single project has been brought to a conclusion. Let me make that clear to you; we must succeed in this. It really is an ambition of mine – and I hope that the Commission will help us in this – to get at least the first sod dug on the Brenner railway tunnel project during our Presidency. If we want to get traffic off the roads, we have to have a competitive rail infrastructure to get it on to; to that there is no alternative. What I ask is that we should play our part in eventually making a success of these Trans-European networks; everything else is rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that I forgot to mention when discussing international issues is the CIA question, and that we are taking very seriously. If I may be perfectly frank about this, there must be no difference in standards here; human rights are indivisible, and so is the rule of law. At the time the American public started to debate this, I happened to be with the Bertelsmann Foundation in Washington, where we met with the Republican Deputy Majority Leader in the Senate, Senator Bennett, and we addressed the issue in precisely those terms. We therefore give our entire support to the Council of Europe in its investigations, and I would also ask the Member States to conduct their own where necessary. There can be no double standards here: hidden jails, secret flights, the handing over of undesirable persons, are things that must of course, where they as suspected, be pursued with the full rigour of the law, but it must be done in accordance with our own legal standards. I have no doubt that your House and our Council will take the same approach to this and go forward together.</p>
<p class="contents">I am much obliged to you for the observation that we have to give much more consideration to children’s rights. We note with great concern that appalling things are going on in this area, with child pornography being transmitted around the globe via the Internet, with people trafficking involving the sale of children around the world, with far too little understanding even in European, developed societies of the need to protect children’s rights, support families, and balance work and family life – all these matters are clearly, of course, for nation states to deal with, but they can be raised at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have raised the subject of the rights of minorities in Austria, and it is one that I am happy to deal with. During my term of office – since the year 2000, that is – town signs in the Croatian and Hungarian languages have been set up in Burgenland; this has been the occasion for great popular celebrations, has involved a great deal of public participation, and there has been a consensus in its favour. Last year indeed, only a matter of a few months ago, as part of the celebrations of our State Treaty’s anniversary, 20 towns and villages acquired additional bilingual signs, and this was a great success. In some boroughs, things have not progressed far enough. Last Friday, I met with 12 mayors in their boroughs in the quest for a shared solution. Although I am making this commitment to your House, it is not your House that should be concerning itself with this issue; on the contrary, it is primarily a matter for us back in Austria. I will not accept the accusation that we, in Austria, take less account of minority rights than do other regions of Europe, but I do want consensus among the political forces, and I want to seek it with the people. I am also confident that we will succeed in finding it.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the labour market, an agreement has been reached with the ten or twelve new Member States. Ten are already on board, and Bulgaria and Romania are yet to be added. I am actually very confident that the new governments will be very cooperative about this in order to be able to keep to the 2007 target date, but these agreements include transitional rules that apply not only to the new countries but also to the existing Member States. I want to say, very frankly, that this has been done by mutual agreement. It is also my duty, as head of the Austrian Government, to take care that neither side of Austrian industry is put under excessive strain and that the balance between openness and protection – to which a number of speakers here have referred – is maintained in this case. I would also add that, in border regions, we are endeavouring to help by way of flexible arrangements for specific sectors – the care sector, for example – and so far, in fact, they have worked very well.</p>
<p class="contents">All I want to do where the European Court of Justice is concerned is to start off a debate in this House, without going into details. Here, too, there needs to be a certain balance between compliance with Community law and its implementation on the one hand and the subsidiarity clauses contained in the Treaties on the other, for there are such things as national rights, and national legislators, national law courts and the European Court of Justice need, in interpreting laws, to take account of them, and also to assess proportionality, as the German, Austrian and French Supreme Courts routinely do. All these things need to be kept in a reasonable balance, and I do not doubt that the European Court of Justice is aware of its responsibilities in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would like to come back to the point that Mr Schulz made about Mozart and Freud and the magic flute, and to what others said about Zeus. I am far more modest and believe that six months’ worth of Presidency can never, realistically speaking, be enough to change Europe. That much is clear. We can, however, get things started. For example, we want to get the financial perspective off the ground, and we want to do it together with you. For that to happen, we need your agreement, and we will seek it. We have to give thought to what are the ideal means to this end. It was Austria that had originally proposed that the European Investment Bank should get some EUR 10 billion extra as a research facility – that is an important forward step made possible by a public/private partnership. There are different ideas of what flexibility means – with amounts between approximately EUR 1 billion and some EUR 3.5 – 4 billion between them – and they leave a certain amount of room for manoeuvre. These issues need to be addressed in a dialogue founded upon trust. First, of course, I need a mandate, and Austria will be getting one from the other Member States in a matter of a few weeks; we will be able to start talking with you as soon as the Commission has come up with its own practical proposals for sharing this out among the various headings. I am sure that we will be able to make more funds available to you in the areas you are interested in – namely research and competitiveness – than was made available during the previous period.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else that should not be overlooked: the financial perspective provides for Bulgaria’s and Romania’s costs to be fully covered by the common agricultural policy, so that adds up to EUR 8 billion included in the current financial perspective. In real terms, resources are being cut by 4%, and EUR 8 billion are additionally being set aside for Romania and Bulgaria. If we look at these things in a realistic and practical light, then I believe that we will certainly, by way of dialogue founded upon trust, be able to sort something out.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no magic flute to hand, any more than I have a conductor’s baton or a magician’s wand, but, if I may refer back to Osmin, it is interesting to note that he actually ends up losing, and what is also interesting is what Constanze, who for our purposes is Europe, says to him at the end: ‘Nothing is as hateful as revenge, but only to great souls is it given to be humane and kindly and to forgive without self-seeking.’ Let us, then, be great souls and do something for Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schüssel has already answered questions concerning the programme of the Austrian Presidency. To conclude, let me simply sum up by giving you a broad outline of how I see this Presidency evolving.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be two key moments: the Spring European Council and the June European Council. The first is designed to implement the new system of governance and the new growth and employment strategy, and the second to take decisions on our measures concerning Europe’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a very important issue needs to be settled with the European Parliament: the question of the 2007-2013 financial perspective. You are well aware of the Commission’s position on this matter. You know how hard the Commission has worked to reach an agreement that is as ambitious as possible. We believe, in fact, that it was important to obtain an agreement among the Member States. Imagine what the state of mind would be in Europe today if we did not at least have the agreement that it was possible to reach in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, there is still room for manoeuvre where the negotiations are concerned. My appeal and that of the entire Commission is a very sincere appeal for realism in these negotiations. We believe, in fact, that any further delays could really jeopardise the application of the new financial perspective starting from 1 January 2007. If that were to happen, then those who would suffer the most would be precisely the new Member States or the regions of Europe that require more solidarity. We therefore believe that there is still room for negotiation, but we need to embark on these negotiations with ambition and realism and with a great sense of responsibility. If we succeed in resolving this problem, then we will be best placed to ensure that the Spring European Council is a great success.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first time that we are applying the new Lisbon system of governance. The Member States have all already submitted their national reform programmes. We are going to present our assessment on 25 January, and I will come to this Chamber to present it to you. I believe that we now have the conditions necessary to give Europe a boost in the areas of growth and employment. We must be clear on this subject, however: we have priorities. Mr Schüssel highlighted some of these priorities, including research, small and medium-sized enterprises and energy, all cases in which the Hampton Court Agenda usefully supplements the Lisbon Agenda. Yet, if we really want growth in Europe, then we genuinely need to have a single market in Europe. The great task now – that of the Commission’s and Parliament’s mandate – is to ensure that the single market works in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 25 of us now, and we need to remember that fundamental freedoms exist that were at the heart of the European Community project: the free movement of goods, undoubtedly, but also the free movement of capital, services and persons, including workers. While we genuinely want Europe, we know that it has to be far more than a market: Europe is a political project and a social project. For Europe to be both of these, we must guarantee fundamental freedoms throughout its territory, by taking care not to create any divisions between the old and the new Member States. We are all now members of this European Union, which is based on the idea of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the June European Council must take a decision regarding Europe’s future. While we are on that subject, I believe that Mr Duff’s question is very important. It is true that there are some appreciable differences, and we are of the opinion that we need to tackle this debate carefully, with an awareness of our responsibilities. On that basis, we believe that it is possible, with the June European Council in mind, to finalise the broad lines of the agenda on Europe’s future, to reach a new consensus with a view to progressing our European project and to find the best opportunity for resolving the institutional issues that do, in fact, need resolving. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There also needs to be a sea change in monetarist policies and macro-economic priorities if we are to address the socio-economic problems faced by a number of countries. Such a change will involve scrapping the Stability and Growth Pact and replacing it with a proper Social Progress and Development Pact, which will promote public investment, the fight against unemployment and inequality and the redistribution of income.</p>
<p class="contents">Statements made by the Presidency have fallen well short of addressing all of these issues. This is nothing new, given the positions of previous presidencies, although we do welcome their words on being open to dialogue. This is not much, though. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

France and Germany have also made proposals designed to move things forward in this area. We can only encourage them in this regard and, as from this week, the European Parliament will play its full part in this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question here of rhetoric, but of ensuring that, after an in-depth consultation, decisions can be made about European matters with no delays or obstacles. We need to go beyond the ‘reflection stage’ and move on to the stage of realistic and courageous proposals to be implemented over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">For Europeans, growth and employment are the most worrying issues. They therefore require a strong political commitment and a precise action programme on the part of Europe, its Member States and its Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the 2006 Spring European Council succeeds in getting the revised Lisbon Strategy back on track in order finally to rescue us from the incantations and to focus our attention on the real issues and, in so doing, to provide a clear indication once again of the direction in which European affairs should be steered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
