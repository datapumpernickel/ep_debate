<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janelly Fourtou (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over many years, the mild climate, the beautiful countryside, the low prices and the warmth and friendliness of the locals have encouraged thousands of Europeans to buy property in the Spanish region of Valencia.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to soaring demand and in order to discourage speculation, the Autonomous Government of Valencia adopted a land development law called the <span class="italic">Ley reguladora de la actividad urbanística</span> (LRAU) in 1994. The European Parliament has since received thousands of petitions against the application of precisely that law. The petitioners are complaining about improper encroachment, as they see it, on their property rights by urban amenity and land development projects. The criticisms relate both to the substance – legal, economic and environmental legitimacy of such projects – and to the form – poor information, lack of transparency, excessively short deadlines for lodging challenges and proposals, and too low a level of compensation. They feel powerless in the face of a situation that is highly complex, since it should be remembered that legal and political responsibility in this area is shared between the Spanish Government as regards land law, the autonomous community of Valencia as regards local legislation concerning planning rules, and the municipalities which, on the basis of both Spanish and regional legislation, implement the programmes which they deem legitimate.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to familiarise itself with the situation on the ground, the Committee on Petitions sent two delegations, one in 2004 and one in 2005, to gather information from the various parties involved. As rapporteur, I was in the second delegation, and I was very impressed by the number of petitioners and found not only what they said but also their trust in Europe’s response very moving. I also valued the attention paid to us by the Valencian authorities and their willingness to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community of Valencia is aware of the problems, and is currently in the process of drafting a new law, called the <span class="italic">Ley Urbanística Valenciana</span> (LUV), which will address the complaints raised by the petitioners. In a spirit of openness, the Valencian Government has also invited the European Parliament to put forward any suggestions it considers necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is often criticised for being remote from its citizens, and this is a good opportunity to show the opposite: the European Parliament, via its Committee on Petitions, is listening to the citizens. The problem, however, is that we cannot overstep our authority because we absolutely cannot give the citizens false hopes that will inevitably be dashed. With regard to the facts and Community competence, we therefore call on the European Commission to continue to ensure that the tendering procedure is followed and to monitor any breaches of the environmental directives. It already started to respond to our calls on 21 March, by opening infringement proceedings against the Kingdom of Spain for failure to comply with the directive on public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">We have insisted to the regional government and to the municipalities that they should provide everyone affected by the LRAU with assistance enabling them to plan a possible process of rectification and compensation. We are calling for the environmental issues so crucial to the future of Europe to be taken into account in all projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank my fellow Members who have shown such enthusiasm for this subject and who have improved my initial report, but I would remind them that we can only act within the bounds of our Community competences and that we have little room for manœuvre. Our response depends, and has depended, on our temperaments and on our commitments. Some tend to do a great deal, others not enough; I myself have tried to strike a happy medium, and it is in that spirit that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will table some amendments intended purely to refocus our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I am tempted to tell the European citizens affected by the LRAU that we have heard them, that we are appalled by the situation and that we are here not to judge, but to try to bring pressure to bear to ensure that they are all listened to and respected, and that, in the end, a fair and balanced solution will be found. I hope that this report will be successful, that the situation will ultimately be made fair for everyone and that the Committee on Petitions will once again be able to show that we are an important link in the chain of the relationship between the citizens and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank all those involved for their work and valuable contributions to this difficult and delicate debate. This is indeed of concern to many EU citizens, as shown by the number of petitions received.</p>
<p class="contents">Two fact-finding missions were sent to Valencia, which gave the committee members an opportunity to meet with representatives of all those concerned and to have a first-hand experience of the situation on the ground. You know better than anyone else the issues at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fourtou’s report touches upon a number of important topics which have attracted the political attention of this House. The Commission, within the limits of its competences, has looked into this matter mainly from an internal market perspective. In concrete terms we have analysed the public procurement dimension of the Spanish law. I shall concentrate on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes the view that the approval of integrated action programmes under the Valencia Land Planning Law involves the award of public work and service contracts. Early in this process the Commission considered that the Valencia Land Planning Law raised questions with respect to EU public procurement legislation. Contracts were awarded without transparency or publication of notices in the EU Official Journal. There were no objective selection or award criteria, no appropriate price clauses, and no equality of opportunity for all those interested in the business opportunity. The Commission therefore decided to launch infringement proceedings against Spain on this issue and sent a letter of formal notice on 21 March 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, we have been working together with the relevant authorities to correct the defects that were detected with the application of the existing law. However, the draft new law that was submitted to my services does not correct all problems identified. In addition, the practical situation has not changed. Public authorities continue to award public contracts without following appropriate tendering procedures. In view of this lack of progress, in a few days I plan to send a letter to the competent authorities in Spain asking them to take appropriate measures to remedy the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconciling planning requirements and procurement laws can be highly complex. However, this must not be an excuse for not applying the EU procurement rules. These rules bring benefits for public authorities, by increasing competition for public contracts and lowering the price of works, supplies and services. Therefore, you can count on my commitment to ensure that EU public procurement rules are respected, both in the letter and the practice, of whatever legislation is approved in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fourtou’s report also raised a number of other issues of concern, but as they fall outside the scope of Community competence, the Commission is not in a position to address them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, has achieved a feat in drafting her report on behalf of the Committee on Petitions and has made masterly use of all her subtractive powers in order to retain the most fundamental elements which it makes sense to put forward in a report which the House is called to vote on, by adhering to the Rules of Procedure and her legal obligations and not exceeding them.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, when the Fourtou report was voted on in the Committee on Petitions, amendments were slipped into the text which touch on the principle of subsidiarity, together with complaints not accompanied by the relevant proof.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the amendments by the rapporteur and her group deleting a number of details. These amendments restore the dignity of the non-legislative text which, of course, has no repercussions. Moreover, we too are trying in turn with our series of amendments to improve the unacceptably didactic and overbearing tone, especially of paragraphs 6 and 11, which are insulting to a Member State. The amendment to paragraph 11 in particular highlights the more general problem of excessive urbanisation of the shores of the Mediterranean in general and stresses the general nature of environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">As for recital Ι, our amendment corrects the vague tone of the text and recalls the infringement proceedings already exercised in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty and European legislation, as you mentioned Commissioner, and this is why we call on everyone voting in favour of the report to vote in favour of these amendments. As to whether the honourable Members will vote in favour of the report, that is up to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He would have been leading for the PSE Group in this debate otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is extremely important for a number of reasons, because it seeks to demonstrate to the citizens of Valencia that this European Parliament is not only a law-making body – which of course it is – but also a voice of the people of Europe when their rights are threatened. I also wish to say that the PSE Group will not accept amendments to this report which seek to weaken it. The report is already a compromise report and is not as strong as I certainly would like it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intolerable that residents of parts of Valencia face the fact that their property has been and may be expropriated by the local state with the consequent enrichment of developers. It is particularly important to insist on the application of directives which come under a Commission remit other than the internal market. I refer specifically to the 2001 directive which deals with strategic environmental impact assessments and the 2000 directive which deals with the prudent use and protection of water resources – all of which are the subject of this complaint. Indeed, it is also important that we should seek ways to press the Valencian Government to put a moratorium on new projects, pending the implementation of a satisfactory new law which meets the full requirements of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that citizens have the right of redress and that they are not kept in the dark as to proposals relating to their property, either when they are buying property or when they are in possession of it. It is not appropriate that any citizens should be unilaterally dispossessed of the property that they enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me refer to another issue. I am sure my colleague would not object to my drawing Commissioner McCreevy’s attention to the fact that last Friday 100 000 people in Ireland marched to express their anger at the Bolkestein directive for which he currently has responsibility. As he is in the Chamber tonight, I want him to appreciate that serious statement of concern by European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the ALDE Group will support our own amendments, of course, but not other amendments that seek to weaken this report further.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about citizens’ rights. More importantly, perhaps, this is a right that goes to the centre of the European Union. Freedom of movement in the European Union has been a real success story, and when our citizens choose to exercise that right by living in – and often retiring to – another Member State, they deserve our protection and support. Many of them make the biggest financial investment they will ever make in their lives by purchasing real property.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what happened to citizens in one region of one Member State. They have come to us in their thousands to explain that something has gone disastrously wrong. The value of their property is being wiped out by a development control law that does not seem to be working. We have produced, I believe, a balanced report that will continue to put pressure on the authorities in Valencia.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three elements that we need to achieve. We need to make sure that you, Commissioner, continue to enforce EU law where you can; we need to make sure that those citizens who have come to us can benefit from some form of compensation or redress mechanism – and for that we must continue to exert pressure on the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also ask you this, Commissioner: we ask our citizens to move and live elsewhere, and we do not want to see this kind of scenario again. So, without interfering in Member States’ land law – which is their own affair – can we please look for some sort of advice, guidance and information for our fellow citizens who buy property in another Member State?</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to see this again. We do not want to nanny our citizens, but we want to support them when they exercise the right to freedom of movement that is so precious to all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot even apply the Treaty in relation to human rights, neither can we apply the directives on public contracts, the framework directive on water, the strategic environmental assessment directive, without dealing with what the President of the Higher Council of Colleges of Architects this very morning described as the land-planning horror: he said that the Mediterranean coast is bursting at the seams, that the territory is suffering from great overcrowding and an irreversible impact that will leave an excessively serious ecological mark.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put an end to this horror as soon as possible, which is violating people’s rights: thousands and thousands of people — the great majority are Valencians — are suffering as a result of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">A sustainable environment is not compatible with this model. I believe that Europe must respond firmly and quickly to these infringements of European directives.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, amongst all of us we have produced a report, thanks to two years of exemplary work by the Committee on Petitions, which unanimously adopted this report. Now, certain people who voted in favour in the Committee on Petitions want to spoil this report irreversibly. I do not believe that that is a very honest way to behave. I believe that the environmental interests of the citizens are more important than the interests of bricks and mortar, which want to cover the entire Mediterranean coast. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, I suspect the European Parliament is once again using a sledgehammer to miss the nut.</p>
<p class="contents">Town planning is a field that needs to remain at local level in order for the needs of local areas to fall on understanding ears. A centralised policy would compound, not ameliorate, the problem. We have seen that time and time again with so-called European projects. Let me remind you of a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have the common fisheries policy, with its seriously damaging quota system. Hailed as an environmental project, it has done near irreparable damage to fish stocks. A huge proportion of fish processing plants in the United Kingdom have been forced to close and local fishing economies have been devastated. And how can we talk about disasters without mentioning the CAP, which created wine lakes and butter mountains and is now giving Commissioner Mandelson as much of a headache as it is the farmers in the developing world? In essence, Chirac, by protecting the little French farmer, is holding the world to ransom. Instead of stabilising the prices of primary product markets, the EU is harming the very people it says it wishes to help.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation facing those non-Spanish nationals in Valencia, including many UK citizens, should be dealt with on a government-to-government basis. I lament the fact that the British Government has failed to reach a bilateral agreement with Spain on this issue. Instead, we see the EU octopus bureaucracy once again using private misfortune to plunder the sovereignty of Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, I am delighted that the petitioners placed their trust in the European Union and in the Committee on Petitions, which I have the honour of chairing. I am also very glad that the Ombudsman for the region of Valencia offered his assistance during the drafting of the report and during our successful search for a solution to this issue. Furthermore, I am delighted that the work carried out by the members of our mission, which visited the region in June, was so productive. This mission was led by Mr Cashman, the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, and also included Mrs Fourtou, whom I should like to thank for having drafted the report. Other members included Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, whom I should also like to thank, and the head of our Committee’s secretariat. The considerable amount of work that was carried out has borne fruit in the shape of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The petitions, which were initially submitted by Charles Svoboda on behalf of the Valencia-based <span class="italic">Abusos Urbanísticos No</span> campaign, and by Mr and Mrs Schuckall and Mrs Perret, were subsequently signed by over 10 000 people. To begin with, one could have been forgiven for asking whether the petitions merited further scrutiny, but it soon became apparent that they did. The reason for this was not only because the principles of environmental protection and the rules for awarding public tenders had been violated, but above all because a fundamental human right had been infringed. By this I mean the right to property, and moreover the right to property of people whose circumstances were frequently very modest, and who wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of their lives in the small homes they had built for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The conversations we held with the petitioners, both during the fact-finding mission and during our meetings, revealed to us the full extent of the tragedy facing these individuals, who had had so much of their property taken away from them. The experiences of these people, who had discovered that they had been stripped of part of their possessions without their knowledge, and that their fundamental rights had been grossly violated, were truly appalling.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Committee adopted the Fourtou report unanimously, with only one abstention. This report was the outcome of a compromise, and of debates within the Committee on the amendments. I therefore believe that this report should now be adopted by the House without any amendments that could distort its meaning. Since it has already been adopted unanimously once, I would be very glad if the House were also to adopt it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, our aim is that Valencia should adopt a new law. It has already promised to do so, which is a testimony to the effectiveness of Parliament’s work and that of its Committee. This law should take due account of human rights and of the rules on environmentally-related public tenders. Compensation for the injured parties is a further issue that needs addressing. We are therefore calling on the Valencian Government to keep detailed records on each individual case, and, where necessary, to offer appropriate compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Commissioner McCreevy, who is here on behalf of the European Commission, will do his best to ensure that no further injustices take place, and that past wrongs are redressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe, however, that this issue is being brought to an end today and also that, by means of this report, the Socialist land-planning model that existed in the Valencian Country, which the Socialists implemented when they were in government, is going to be called into question. Such are the consequences. I am therefore pleased that, as Mr Libicki said, from now on, as a result of this new report, which I imagine the European Parliament will approve, this Parliament is going to applaud, amongst other things, the initiative that the current Valencian Government should negotiate and draw up a new law that replaces the previous Socialist law.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would like to stress that this new law, which will be drawn up and applied, will contain, amongst others, two fundamental points: firstly, that this new law will be approved in accordance with competences in the field of land-planning which fall exclusively to the Valencian Government, and, secondly, that the report also approves a series of recommendations so that the rule of law can deal with any complaints which, in application of the former LRAU, may have arisen or which may arise. In other words, all the rights of the citizens who have complained to this Committee on Petitions are now going to be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that the proper solution will come with the disappearance of the LRAU created by the previous Socialist government, and I am convinced that the proper solution will be found through the application of the new law that the People’s Party Government of the Valencian Country intends to create. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has taken an open approach and we have been able to discuss many compromise amendments, and we also know that she has had a difficult job to do, because this is an issue in relation to which you cannot imagine the number of different interests at play and hence the pressure we face.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that, firstly, thousands of European citizens have lived in the Valencian Country for decades, millions visit us every year and that these people are happy to live in our Community and are happy with the high-quality services which they generally receive in their daily lives. We are therefore talking about a welcoming Country. The majority of people there and those who want to come feel that it is a fortunate thing to be able to share their lives with us.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be noted that the majority can resolve their problems properly before the courts and be dealt with by certain local authorities in many places. But many people’s problems are not resolved, and we are currently faced with huge numbers of people whose problems persist. I am therefore dismayed about the fact that, over the last three years, complaints about land-planning abuses have increased very considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">As a European citizen, born and resident in the Valencian Country, I sincerely regret that we need to hold this debate, but we must remember that, if this is the case, it is due to the fact that the complaints presented in this Parliament have been from thousands of European citizens who feel themselves to be victims of land-planning abuses. I wish to state clearly that we are facing an exceptional situation in Spain and in the rest of Europe, which, we should remember, has led to formal protests by seventeen European Union ambassadors.</p>
<p class="contents">Other Spanish regions have laws similar to the LRAU; the head of the Autonomous Secretariat for Land-Planning and the Environment came here to say that that law was very good. Despite having similar laws, they have clearly never had a problem of this scale.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to say to you that it is right that we should deal with the citizens’ concerns, I believe that the authorities wanted the delegation that went there to make proposals, and I believe that that is what the Committee has done. I believe that we must demand respect for the citizens in the face of economic groups with immense power, and against which the citizens often have little defence. I believe that we have the power to make a contribution to what Mr Iturgaiz suggested: not to have to repeat this debate and to be able to put an end to this situation. If we do not promote these solutions now, it is clear that in the future, unfortunately, we will have to face this problem all over again.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, as a citizen of the Valencian Country, I want these problems to be resolved and for the incompetence of a regional government not to spoil our image, as is happening in the eyes of many European citizens, because our Community does not deserve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the end, what we are being presented with today, ladies and gentlemen, is a mixture of irresponsible populism on the part of Members who wish to satisfy their fellow citizens resident in Spain at any cost and on the part of Spanish Members who have decided to play local or regional politics in the European Parliament — from one side and from the other: you have just seen a demonstration of this.</p>
<p class="contents">That combination of two kinds of irresponsible populism leads to aberrations such as those which may be voted for here if this text is not modified. It is sad to see the European Parliament turned into a regional legislator, entirely distorting the principle of subsidiarity and telling an Autonomous Community what it must do, how it must do it, how it must legislate, when it can grant planning permission and under what conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand and agree with the criticisms of this law, unquestionably, and I naturally agree with the criticisms of its application by the Valencian Government — of the law and of its application.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, however, ladies and gentlemen, is not the Sanctuary of Lourdes, to which people can resort when all hope has run out everywhere else. This is a serious institution and all that is achieved by bringing a resolution of this kind here is to create a false image to the citizens, since resolutions are approved that will be entirely sterile, because it is in the Valencian Parliament that this issue will be resolved, and this creates a reputation which in no way enhances the work of this House nor increases the respect that we are asking the citizens to feel for our work.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore entirely agree with the criticisms of the land-planning situation in Valencia: the criticisms of the law and the criticisms of the government. Dealing with it in this House is like protesting here about delays on the London underground. I do not believe that the European Parliament is the proper place to do this and what we are doing, by approving a document like this, is distorting the institutional system itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said this, I believe that it is necessary to introduce a requirement for a common European vision regarding territorial planning and environment protection. It is my assumption that real estate speculators take advantage of the feeble nature of Valencian autonomy. This is a breeding ground for large-scale corruption. A consensus is necessary in the EU in order to avoid policies that threaten rational European planning and the environment. States, regions and autonomous communities should play a role in the definition of this consensus. The failure to move towards this goal will cause areas such as the Valencian Country and the Balearic Islands, where construction is the main economic activity, to see their whole territories jeopardised. It is already a major anomaly that the building sector is the main profitable activity in our part of the world. Not putting an end to this will mean that certain business groups will become richer, bringing about massive social, environmental and economic troubles in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must bear in mind the fact that current land law in Spain accords landowners 90% of the building rights and that it is a peculiar characteristic of the law under consideration – the law on the expropriation of land – that it compels owners to hand over 10% of their land, without compensation, to any local body with a plan to develop it. We must also be aware that many owners have sustained real detriment as a result of these development processes, and that some planned developments have had devastating effects on the environment and the ecological balance of many coastal areas and especially on the future prospects for water supply, which is something else about which the European Union is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, then, very glad to learn that the Region of Valencia has revised this law and has already produced a new one to replace it. We must take care to ensure that the law includes, above all, an unambiguous definition of what is meant by ‘public interest’, in order to obviate, beyond all doubt, the overwhelming likelihood of the ‘public interest’ defence for expropriations being deployed to benefit private rather than public interests.</p>
<p class="contents">There must also be binding criteria for the calculation of compensation for expropriations, and these must be founded upon standards and principles recognised in the case law of the ECJ and the European Court of Human Rights. This is, however, a special case, and this House must be careful not to raise the public’s hopes too high, since they may, in the event, prove impossible to fulfil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the complaints we are discussing here are directed at a legitimate law, approved by a regional parliament in accordance with its competences and not invalidated by the Constitutional Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the judgments that we are issuing in no sense relate to illegal acts: Spain is a country with guarantees, with an open legal system, which culminates in the European Courts, and it falls to them to make moral judgments according the clear principle of criminal law of <span class="italic">nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I understand the considerations that Mr Guardans has expressed and I would not have tolerated an encroachment of the competences either of the regional Parliament or of the national Parliament or the Spanish courts.</p>
<p class="contents">It does fall to this Parliament and Mrs Fourtou has done this with unrivalled elegance to deal with the citizens’ petitions and to make recommendations; recommendations, incidentally, that the current government of the Valencian Country have taken up with great generosity and intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">What this Parliament cannot do is try to take over the job of land-planning that is the responsibility of the regional authorities, which is the impression I got from the speech – in English I believe – by my compatriot Joan i Marí.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a moratorium cannot be established either, because that falls to the regional Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this Parliament cannot establish compensation: an administrative authority cannot pay compensation without a judicial judgment or an administrative resolution without being guilty of the misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this Parliament is not the place, as Mr Guardans has said quite rightly — and I address this to Mr Calabuig — for a political trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Calabuig has not said that the law that we are discussing was decided upon by the Socialist majority to which he belongs, and not by the majority to which I belong. Secondly, he has not said that he is the author of an amendment that states that the petitions focus on the last three years, a period during which Mr Camps’ government has been in power; the petitions come from a long time before that and his politically-inspired intention is for the regional government to be blamed, because it is that government — so far with little success, by the way, and long may that continue — that he wants to bring down.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I agree with Mr Guardans: it is not proper, it is not morally correct, to use this Parliament to blacken the name of a Community, of a legitimately elected Parliament and of a government supported by the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I wish to thank Members for their comments. The sheer number of people who have supported the petitions covered by Mrs Fourtou’s report demonstrates that the application of the LRAU law in Valencia is raising problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As I indicated at the beginning of this debate, most of the problems encountered fall outside the scope of Community law. While the Commission understands the concerns raised, it is not in a position to provide a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Where problems of compatibility with Community law are identified, the Commission will not fail to act and will take the necessary steps aimed at rectifying the situation. This is the case for public procurement aspects of the LRAU law. We have identified a number of problems in this area, and infringement proceedings against Spain were opened. We are pursuing these procedures with a view to ensuring a correct application of Community procurement legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues in various departments of the Commission have looked at the report covering areas such as environmental policy, justice and home affairs, consumer policy and regional policy. It would be wrong to raise expectations that, in these areas, the enforcement of Community law will offer the petitioners a solution to the problems they have encountered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That law entitles project developers to take land from house owners illegitimately, with the latter receiving very little, or no, compensation, only to be expected to cough up again for the construction of roads, sewage and street lights.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, Parliament has addressed this problem and will, tomorrow, be voting on the report on it by the Liberal Member Mrs Fourtou. In so doing, it will be urging Valencia to improve the law – a process that was set in motion after a visit by a European inquiry committee – and to set up a procedure for assessing the situation of house owners on a case-by-case basis, including compensatory measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, on previous occasions, spoken with Dutch people in the region and I am pleased that the urgency of the situation is finally being recognised. It is a good thing that Valencia has, at Europe’s request, started to review the law, but those words will now also need to be translated into action to prevent more owners from being treated unfairly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Property owners in Valencia have had their property and land confiscated on a massive scale and built on by often unscrupulous property developers and local authorities, acting with the connivance of the Valencian authorities under the terms of the LRAU. Petitions to the European Parliament and two fact-finding missions attest to this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">This is totally unacceptable in a free society.</p>
<p class="contents">There should be a moratorium on all current and planned urbanisation projects in the region until new legislation which fully respects property rights is adopted by the Valencian Parliament. For those that have lost land and property to development by Valencian authorities a new law should establish as a matter of urgency a legal administrative structure with the power to review development plans and to assess proper compensation for victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Property owners who have lost out through collusion between property developers and the local authorities in Valencia must be properly compensated.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the Valencian authorities reviewing the policy of land appropriation, there is still a need for justice for citizens who have already lost land and property. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
