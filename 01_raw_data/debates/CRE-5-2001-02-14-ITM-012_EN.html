<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ceyhun (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in August 2000, two initiatives were put forward by the then French Council Presidency to combat criminal networks trading in human beings and to take appropriate preventive measures. But before that, a great many refugees had to die as victims of these criminal networks trading in human beings. Unfortunately, they are still dying. Every week, we read at least two reports about this sad state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the European Union must act without delay. The Council Directive defining the facilitation of illegal immigration and unauthorised residence defines a statutory framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence by criminal networks trading in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The second initiative is a Council Framework Decision on the strengthening of the penal framework to combat the facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence and hence to prevent the exploitation of refugees. I must admit that both initiatives could actually be offered as a single initiative. They could be combined into a single proposal on the same legal base, that of the first pillar. Unfortunately, I was unable to convince the French Interior Minister. I am pleased that my proposed amendments were backed by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we no longer have two restrictive proposals but two proposals which can deal differently with the different target groups. While the criminal networks trading in human beings must be combated, NGOs or churches and other similar organisations which offer humanitarian aid to persecuted human beings must not be treated as criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not ignore the fact that, sadly, even today, tens of thousands of people have to flee from various forms of persecution and war. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, is it a criminal act to help a persecuted person in this situation? Quite frankly, I am glad that there are courageous people who help those who are being persecuted. For this reason, it was very important to define facilitation and the honest facilitator precisely. The text of the French initiative did not distinguish between individual and organised facilitation or between commercial and moral facilitation. That is why a correction was crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not like to overlook the fact that trading in human beings is a lucrative business for criminals. But it would be a fatal mistake to believe that this problem can only be solved with restrictive measures. Police and judicial measures must be accompanied by a common European asylum and immigration policy. Only in this way can we succeed in preventing the sad events we all witnessed at Dover from being repeated in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been easy to reject the proposals of the French government, which I criticised, as there is no common asylum and immigration policy. It really would have been the easiest thing for us to simply declare the matter settled in five minutes. But, given the fate of the victims, that would have been irresponsible. That is why I am glad that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and I have managed, with my report, to develop the initiatives so that both humanitarian and penal demands can be met.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that the PPE-DE is not prepared to back this report. On the other hand, I am delighted to be able to thank the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for their sensible, supplementary proposals. I hope that, with my report, we will show the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left that, in such a difficult situation, the European Parliament will put forward to the Council groundbreaking proposals for action which will represent the interests not only of the state but also of humanity.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kirkhope (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, when I left the House of Commons in the United Kingdom in 1997 I thought I had got away from debates that took place after 10 p.m. It is very comforting, however, to see that we are able to debate matters of great importance later in the evening. I am also interested to note that in the United Kingdom debates now seem to have been truncated into times that are well before 10 p.m. The balance of power, in that sense, has certainly shifted.</p>
<p class="contents">I was privileged to be an immigration minister in the last government. It is important for me to emphasise straight away that the EPP is in agreement with the aim of the French initiative. It is vitally important to curb illegal immigration and to deal with the criminals who are exploiting poor people to their own advantage, both financially and in other ways. However, sadly, as shadow rapporteur I am unable to speak in support of many of Mr Ceyhun's amendments, as I believe that these do not actually address the issue but could on the contrary have the effect of exacerbating it.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, it seems to me difficult to try to decriminalise the facilitation of illegal immigration for some groups rather than others. The notion that those acting with humanitarian intentions should be immune from prosecution is very problematic and certainly subjective. I, as a lawyer, also have to question why the law should apply to some and not to others. The humanitarian motives referred to in many of the amendments of Mr Ceyhun are, again, very difficult to define or to interpret in a fair and proper manner in a court of law. This does not imply that humanitarian organisations should refrain from aiding such people after their proper entry into a Member State – I would very much support that continuing, and certainly being a feature in future – but rather that they have no more right to participate in any illegal act, in our view, than anyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it also has to be stressed that illegal immigrants whose entry is assisted by traffickers should surely be no more immune to prosecution than other illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there is a difficulty with the implementation of a common immigration and asylum policy. I, as a British Conservative, have doubts about that. But tonight I am perfectly happy that we should look at it in the context of how it will develop. We are not yet ready. We do not yet have that policy in place. Given that such a policy may be implemented, this report appears at an inopportune moment. It is imperative that the parameters of the common immigration and asylum policy should be established before any inner standards – such as those addressed in this report – are set. Improving the legal status of refugees, as stated in Amendment No 2, is not, to my knowledge, part of any common immigration and asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards compensatory payments, the rapporteur does not detail how the money would be spent. An increase in the EU budget surely requires more justification than is shown. It is always important to distinguish between asylum and immigration: those are two separate issues, the latter of which is covered by the 1951 Geneva Convention. Amendments underlining the importance of that convention are certainly welcomed by me and the EPP.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the French initiative. We merely regret that this report has appeared before its time and is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should first like to congratulate my colleague Mr Ceyhun for the work he has done and his efforts to cover all the sensitive issues surrounding these two initiatives. Secondly, I must stress to this House something which is an absolute priority for the future of the European Union, our society and the political project we are constructing from here. It is the need for a Community immigration and asylum policy, something we will not be able to achieve without commitment, effort and hard work from the European Union’s political institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate a number of issues that this House and the Council must take clearly into account when making future decisions. It is essential to distinguish between the disinterested humanitarian aiding of illegal immigration and the activities of criminal networks as laid down in Article 27 of the Schengen Convention. It is also important to distinguish clearly between those who benefit directly and actively from illegal immigration, such as those who organise and take part in the transport of illegal immigrants, and on the other hand the passive and indirect beneficiaries, who are the ones who profit from the work of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be stressed that the economic benefit itself may be direct or indirect, depending on the nature of the activity performed. I realise, however, that carriers cannot be held liable for transporting persons who request political asylum immediately upon arrival within the territory of a Member State. Carriers have neither the ability nor the authority to assess the admissibility of an application for asylum, and hence I understand that under no circumstances can they be directly or indirectly persuaded through these instruments to carry out an assessment of suitability. Sanctions must be proportionate and balanced and the punishment must be made to fit the crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The means and ends must strictly respect the obligations accepted by the countries which are parties to the 1951 Geneva Convention as regards asylum-seekers entering an EU Member State. The purpose of such measures must never be to dissuade asylum-seekers from exercising their legitimate right to seek the protection of a signatory state, since this would constitute an infringement of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to point out that the Member States need to be aware that certain regions of the European Union are particularly affected by illegal immigration, and because of their geographical position they are having to shoulder much of the burden imposed by the immigration policies, so budget lines should be developed to allow compensatory payments, which will increase solidarity within the European Union in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, we saw drowned people washed up on the Spanish coast. Such tragedies occur around Europe every day, if not always in such spectacular forms.</p>
<p class="contents">The gangs that earn money from exploiting people’s desperation and smuggle them across borders under horrendous safety conditions must, of course, be punished. This is an inhumane business. Joint efforts are required here at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the initiative proposed by France only deals with a small part of these incredibly complex issues concerning migration and refugees. Despite fine declarations of global responsibility, the EU Member States have not been able to agree on a common asylum and immigration policy. It seems that the only thing that can be agreed upon is repressive measures. The smugglers must of course be punished, and airlines that allow persons without valid documents to board must pay fines. It is unreasonable to leave it to the cabin crew to assess people’s need for protection. One must also ask <span class="italic">why</span> people stake everything they own in order to be smuggled into an unknown country in unsafe conditions. Is it really possible to get into the EU by lawful means when we require visas from 130 countries? I do not believe it is. The EU is in the process of building a Fortress Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive programme on migration issues. A common policy is required in this area. The report written by the rapporteur is an important modification of the French proposal, because he attempts to see the nuances. Certainly the gangs must be punished, but there are people who conceal refugees without any prospect of profit because they are convinced that the refugees are risking life and limb if they are sent back to their home country. Relatives, friends or individual organisations must not be punished for this. A distinction must be made.</p>

<p class="contents">In the majority of EU States, figures on the granting of refugee status and traditional immigration channels are falling systematically. On the other hand, the figures for overall immigration have remained stable in recent years, proving that restrictive policies on immigration and visas have succeeded only in increasing the number of illegal immigrants. On a daily basis, men, women and children die in the attempt to enter illegally into a Europe which has become a real Fortress. For the most part they fall victim to smugglers and traffickers. Unfortunately, their ordeal continues once they have entered European States as, without regular papers, they can be freely exploited and forced to suffer intolerable living conditions. We should point out that some legal immigrants have been made illegal by restrictive legislation. Some of these have been living in Europe for over twenty years. They can no longer be expelled, nor can their situation be regularised. What means is available to them to earn a living and support their families?</p>
<p class="contents">The solutions laid down in the proposed initiatives replicate these repressive measures and grounds for exclusion. They give rise to tragedies such as those in Dover, Gibraltar or the situation of those immigrants without regular papers in Spain, Belgium and France who are on hunger strike in order to obtain recognition. Who is really responsible?</p>
<p class="contents">Not only do these proposals not meet these requirements, but they even go so far as to challenge the right of asylum or the right of family reunion. While it is clear that we must staunchly fight the organised networks trafficking in human beings, it is unjust to condemn natural or legal persons who, in good faith, assist asylum seekers fleeing conflict, famine and the horrors caused by economic and democratic deficits. These initiatives, therefore, lump all categories together in an inadmissible and dangerous fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">While the proposed amendments limit some of the damage, we reject the initiatives and would vehemently urge the authors to go back to the drawing board. It is only possible to combat illegal immigration within the framework of an overall Community policy that is clear and that respects the dignity of human beings based on genuine respect for fundamental rights and based on a new North-South relationship. Finally we would point out that the best weapon to combat discrimination and human exploitation is to acknowledge rights and thus to regularise their status. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are doing is treating the symptoms. We are doing nothing about the real disease. The disease is, of course, the fact that there are 20 million refugees in the world. The present project will lead to there being fewer humanitarians and more mafiosi involved in the trafficking in human beings and in helping to transport refugees. It is said that trafficking in human beings is a lucrative business, but I maintain that, with projects like this, it will become still more lucrative. The price will rise, and the mafia will, of course, add the cost of their fines to it. That means more money from desperate people in the pockets of the mafia. There will be fewer suppliers and ever more demand. That means higher prices. We know this, of course, from the market economy in general. It will mean more unscrupulous players and, therefore, more Dover-style accidents. I have to say that the rapporteur has done his best to temper the proposal. He has really made an effort, but it is nonetheless still a matter of treating the symptoms. We are not treating the disease. Our group will, of course, support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the Liberal Group. Above all, we shall support the proposals completely to reject this move, and my group will vote very differently in the final vote on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fundamental reason for this is one that affects these and all initiatives dealing with the framework of criminal legislation in the Union. As a European federalist, and therefore not a Eurosceptic, I consider it monstrous that criminal legislation should be adopted and implemented without any approval by a democratically and legitimately elected Parliament with the legitimacy to grant it. Here, as elsewhere, I find the road the European Union is taking monstrous.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminal law cannot be removed from parliamentary debate. Because of the very delicacy of the matter, it cannot be abstracted from more general considerations relating to society, risks, weights and counterweights, fundamental causes, and economic and social causes. The only line on which European integration policy is advancing rapidly is that of repression, because that is easy. Decisions are prepared by groups of civil servants from the Ministries of Justice and Home Affairs, whose only concern is the efficiency of the repression mechanisms, without any consideration – it is not their fault, that is their craft, their professional approach – or concern for issues arising from society, the economy, work, international policy or development. We are travelling very fast down the line of repression while, on the other lines, such as guaranteeing the right of asylum and the right to a defence, the European Parliament, the European Union, the European Commission and the Council are incapable of making progress. So that is the main reason why we cannot accept the Council’s proposals. We cannot accept a report which does not reject them out of hand because, even on this matter, the European Parliament – as usual – is just being consulted and does not have any real powers.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the merit of the argument – as Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mrs Frahm have said – it is an illusion to imagine that strengthening the ban on immigration produces anything other than a strengthening of illegal immigration and the forces of illegality overwhelming us. Our frontiers are being overwhelmed by the illegality produced by our prohibitionist laws. That is the reality. We should not delude ourselves that we can solve the problem by tinkering with the penalties for carriers of illegal immigrants without democratic consultation. It is possible – although I hope this does not happen – that we will only succeed in making things worse.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the fundamental economic causes are not being addressed. Commissioner Lamy put a brave proposal to the European Commission for unilateral liberalisation of imports from the poorest countries. That is a means of attacking the fundamental causes, not just doling out charity, alms and assistance but opening our markets to their agricultural products and basic manufacturers. ‘Everything but arms’ the proposal was called. It was sunk by the lobbies in the European Union and, consequently, pressure from migrations is growing ever stronger. So the Lamy proposal gets sunk and, at the same time, we delude ourselves that we can solve the problem by a few months’ increase in the penalties meted out to those who ply a trade we have presented them with as a gift, for profits we, with our laws, make possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot delude ourselves – I say this to Mr Ceyhun and Members on the left – that partial improvement – we are in favour of certain amendments – of this repressive framework can change the situation. Only as a lesser evil do we support the distinction between immigration for economic profit and immigration for humanitarian purposes, but we do not think it can solve the problem, as you on the left point out yourselves, when you assert that economic causes are ultimately responsible for immigration. How can you sustain the argument that economic causes are the fundamental causes and, at the same time, take such a strong stand against the entrepreneurs and profiteers running illegal immigration?</p>
<p class="contents">This prohibitionist attitude is not confined to immigration alone, but also to the labour market and the new forms of employment – part-time work, temporary work, short-term contracts, seasonal contracts – and it is an attitude that the left, and the unions too, are largely responsible for in Europe. Let us not try to salve our consciences by attacking the entrepreneurs and those who exploit labour for, in the eyes of the exploited, the people condemned to die in their own country of hunger and a total lack of the means to survive, the European entrepreneur-exploiter may well be the only hope of advancement and salvation for them and their families.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I consider the two initiatives by the French Republic seeking to better define and strengthen penal sanctions against assisting the illegal entry of aliens into European territory to be particularly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Illegal immigration, which is growing rapidly, is indeed becoming a major problem for the countries of Europe. A good indication of this is the increase in the number of asylum requests, which have virtually doubled in the last three years in the main European countries, even though approximately three quarters of these are rejected as unjustified, thereby greatly increasing the number of immigrants illegally resident on our territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol currently estimates that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union every year. This influx of marginalised individuals provides a breeding ground for all sorts of crime and exploitation. According to the United Nations Organisation, even within Europe some half a million people from this illegal staff pool are reduced to slavery, mostly women and children, who are victims of sexual or economic exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is a source of shame for Europe and I must say that I am shocked when I read the Commission communication of 22 November 2000 on the Community immigration policy to find that it includes only one tiny paragraph, and a vague one at that, on illegal immigration. I am shocked, too, to see that the Commission’s first practical proposal in application of this policy was for a particularly lenient draft directive on family reunion.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, one has the impression that the concerns of the Commission are out of step with the concerns of Member States, which raise genuine practical problems. For, after the French Presidency, which made the fight against illegal immigration one of its priorities, we now have the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and his Italian counterpart, Giuliano Amato, sounding the alarm and demanding an action plan to combat such trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I totally agree completely with Mr Kirkhope that the amendments by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are quite misplaced, as they water down the French text. I also agree that these texts have been brought out at just the right time. Contrary to the claims made in some of the committee’s amendments, there is no need to wait for a general policy on immigration before taking steps immediately in the specific field of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear need for such action as a matter of urgency. Indeed it is a requirement of the Treaty of Amsterdam, since Article 63(3) stipulates that, for the five years following its entry into force, measures must be taken as a priority against, I quote, “illegal immigration and illegal residence, including repatriation of illegal residents.”</p>
<p class="contents">The French Republic’s initiatives on illegal immigration must therefore be approved, followed up and reinforced. We must, incidentally, note our approval of Article 67(1) of the Treaty of Amsterdam which, amid some more unfortunate provisions, had the wisdom to retain Member States’ right of initiative in parallel with the Commission’s, even in those aspects of immigration policy which it sought to communitise. This exceptional juxtaposition, which, in this instance, turns out to be very helpful, is unfortunately only a temporary situation since it is scheduled to last only for a transitional period of five years following the entry into force of the Treaty. It is therefore going to expire on 30 April 2004. However, at that very time, at the beginning of 2004 we are due to have an intergovernmental conference that will specifically have to look into the distribution of competences between the European Union and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it would be a good idea for its agenda to include a proposal for extending the duration and scope of States’ right of initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation has been exacerbated, not only because it has proved to be extremely lucrative and less risky than other forms of trafficking, such as drugs trafficking, for example, but also because this activity actually benefits from shortcomings in the legislation and action of Member States and from all the factors that allow illegal immigrants to enter and remain in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal now before us, which is intended to strengthen the fight against illegal immigrants entering and staying, must pay particular attention to two factors: first of all, the issue of employers’ responsibility and the consequences that using an illegal workforce may entail. We must look at the situations in our own Member States with regard to the illegal employment market – and the issue of trafficking in human beings, which must be fought hard, paying particular attention to the trafficking of women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which is one of the most odious aspects of this type of trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Tragic events such as the one that took place in Dover last June or those that have come to light following the successful ‘Cathedral’ police operation are situations that no democratic society can tolerate. What we must do is target those who assist illegal immigration. It is crucial that each Member State adopts the necessary measures to ensure that the deliberate facilitation of the unauthorised entry, movement and residence of immigrants is considered to be an offence punishable by effective, proportionate, dissuasive criminal penalties. The European Union is now facing new challenges caused by migratory flows in evidence throughout the world. We must address these challenges as one wide-ranging issue. The Member States must have a common immigration and asylum policy that is appropriate to their demographic, economic and humanitarian needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I want to congratulate my colleague Mr Ceyhun for approaching a very difficult and sensitive issue. Referring to what Mr Kirkhope said, this is an issue of great importance and I could not agree with him more. I am sure he would agree with me that it is very sad that on an issue like this, which covers the pages of many of our newspapers, there is – to the best of my knowledge – no press here to cover it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also to recognise that this report is just one piece of a jigsaw. It is a very difficult jigsaw that we are trying to put together. We need a proper system of immigration and asylum that will cater for the needs of Europe in the modern world. I say to Mrs Frahm and Mr Cappato that this is what we are aiming for, and I do not believe the rhetoric you used just now is helpful in such a very difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">On specific points, Mr Kirkhope referred to his anxieties about paragraphs 11 and 12, and I know the points that he is making there. But the reference is to legally recognised organisations, NGOs, with which all of us are familiar. We have to ask ourselves is someone or an organisation that is helping people in desperate circumstances escape persecution a criminal? Are they the organisations that we ought to be legislating against? I would say not. We know, and others have said, that people escaping from these situations are desperate people escaping conflict, war and circumstances like that. That is why we need these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do more. We must do more to help those developing countries and help the countries that are war-torn and with regimes that we do not like. But we cannot do that overnight. I do not believe we are helping those people who are trying to get out by doing nothing and leaving the situation as it is, so they have to clamber into the back of lorries and suffocate and endure torture and misery. We have to make certain that we have a proper asylum system that is not skewed by the overemphasis on illegal immigration. Our job in the new few months, as a Parliament, will be to report on the Commission's opinions in a way that reminds all Member States that their national interest must not override our global and humanitarian obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has quite rightly been brought before the court, not because he immigrated illegally but because he grassed on illegal immigrants from the former East Germany to the state security police. In my opinion, it should still be possible for people who betray refugees or illegal immigrants to the police to be prosecuted. Why? Both the Commission proposal and the report admit that illegal entry can lead to an application for asylum being approved. Yet this is tantamount to admitting, albeit unintentionally, that, for most people, it is no longer possible to enter the EU legally. This confirms, also unintentionally, the criticism made by the UNHCR of the EU and its isolationist policy towards refugees. That is why the promised immunity from prosecution does not help refugees who are accepted as asylum seekers, because they must then betray the people who were actually able to help them in their application for asylum. The conclusion is that separating commercial from humanitarian facilitation serves no useful purpose because the policy of isolation is increasingly being promoted and aid for refugees is becoming more of a financial burden. If a decision cannot be reached to dismantle the fortress that is the EU, then at least this report must be rejected and aid for refugees must be promoted both in terms of commercial and humanitarian facilitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very positive desire to want to do something considering that, every year, half a million people enter the European Union illegally, half of whom have been facilitated in this way. Organised crime does brisk and relatively risk-free business with these people, which is why the initiative is to be welcomed, though it has not been put in an overall context.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at Mr Ceyhun’s report, I have to say that the intentions, namely to help refugees, are good. But what the report proposes in terms of measures is anything but conducive to combating facilitation. Rather, in my and our estimation, what is being proposed here will lead to the expansion of facilitation. Furthermore, the business will continue to be risk-free for criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">According to these proposals, persons or groups will <span class="italic">a priori</span> be immune from prosecution if they take illegal immigrants across borders for humanitarian reasons and without payment. But what will the consequence be? How quickly do you think criminal organisations will make use of such a legal construct? The whole thing would then be not only useless but counterproductive. What is more, your proposals are moving in a direction in which our understanding of the law and our legal system are being turned on their heads. They will introduce subjectivity, since legal persons or groups rather than the courts will decide whether a criminal act, namely facilitation, is a criminal act or not. That is a reversal of our legal system and will certainly not lead to the desired goal.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Ceyhun, I am convinced that you doubtless acted in good faith but the instrument you are proposing is neither legally nor effectively conducive to achieving a positive outcome. What we need is a comprehensive system and I believe we are working towards this together. I am also convinced that, during the course of this year, working jointly with the Commission, we will be successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as traffickers are concerned, as I maintained in my report on Albania, concentrating mainly on traffickers, as if they were the root cause of immigration, does not help us to understand or manage this phenomenon. The fact, as other members have said, that carriers often save human lives, by helping people to escape from persecution by totalitarian regimes, and provide services to refugees protected by the Geneva Convention and desperate people who have nowhere else to turn, is often passed over in silence. We must, I think, distinguish between disinterested, humanitarian aiding of illegal immigrants and the aiding of illegal immigrants by members of criminal networks for the purpose of gain, as proposed by our rapporteur, Mr Ozan Ceyhun, whom I congratulate on the many improvements which he has made to the French initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that any initiatives along these lines must be incorporated as quickly as possible into an integrated European immigration policy, which will have legal channels and, more importantly, which will guarantee the legalisation and social integration of those already living in the European Union. But, Commissioner, this sort of policy does not seem to be making any headway; on the contrary, the Council appears to be desperate to take what are, for the most part, repressive and fragmentary measures, rather than to introduce an integrated immigration policy as called for by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a despicable traffic, which causes so much harm and even tragedy amongst the immigrants themselves and great concern within the European Union, a concern sometimes greater than that seen in some of these immigrants’ countries of origin, although it is a hard thing to say. We must therefore receive the two French initiatives with satisfaction. But the report by Mr Ceyhun suffers from a lack of legal rigour, which if not corrected will make it impossible to vote in favour – and believe me I am sorry – particularly on the point I am about to mention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am personally acquainted with the magnificent work that some NGOs are doing in this field; the humanitarian care many of them are giving surpasses their own means. But from that to generalising that if an association performs the criminal action of providing organised aid for the entry, residence or movement of illegal immigrants it should be exempt from liability, is going too far. This is because profit or financial benefit, as for example happens in Spanish criminal law, is an aggravating circumstance but it is not the essential component in characterising the crime of trafficking in human beings. This does not mean that there are not aspects of the report that can be accepted and which I applaud, such as the compensation for the regions that most suffer from migratory pressure or prosecution of employers who use and abuse these workers illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in any case, I believe that in this battle against illegal immigration the cooperation of the countries of origin is absolutely necessary, since without it any attempt to combat these criminal networks is doomed to failure. The European Union alone cannot control this migration phenomenon if it cannot count on the essential collaboration of the countries from which the migration originates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I really do not understand at all. I do not understand why they have not been able to revitalise and fulfil it over all these months. What I see is that with initiatives like this one they will not only revitalise it, they will bombard it.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time of night, and coming from a Spanish and Portuguese evening that Ms Cerdeira and I attended, I am tempted to surrender to Mr Cappato’s rhetorical charms and agree with him completely, because in fact the only thing I can understand is that the ministers meet on one side and on the other there is some machinery which points towards other objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand why the Council does not go after some coherent political proposals, which follow one behind the other in pursuit of the clear objectives of creating a common, coherent and global immigration policy and asylum policy in the European Union, instead of advancing piecemeal on absolutely specific and partial topics which throw this policy off balance and make it increasingly difficult to make progress on the Tampere agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Seeing that in the Council the ministers have also decided – paradoxically in my view – to support this French proposal, and it should be either discussed immediately or moved on, my Group will in any case try to send them the clear message that we in the European Union must not confuse compassion, the work of some people in the front line helping immigrants, with the traffic in people. We shall try to do so by supporting the amendments that Mr Ceyhun has drawn up so well and also the amendments that Ms Cerdeira has added to the report. If we succeed, we shall vote in favour of this report and we shall try to send this message to the Council. If not, we shall see tomorrow what we can do with it: we shall probably have some difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is basically an issue that concerns the violation of human rights and human dignity. Throughout the world, tens of thousands of human beings are trafficked for the purpose of exploitation every year.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of this issue does not mean – and I think that this criticism is unfair – that we are addressing it because we are obsessed with building a Fortress Europe. This issue, which is complex and requires us to be very precise in the terms we use to discuss it, is today at the very top of the international agenda and, I think, received a broad, worldwide consensus when the United Nations Organisation promoted the adoption of a Convention against Transnational Organised Crime last December. This convention contains two additional protocols, one on the illegal transporting of immigrants into a country – smuggling, to use the English term – and another specifically covering the trafficking of people. These two protocols were signed by 81 States at the High Level Conference in Palermo last December.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the signatories to the United Nations Convention are all the Member States of the European Union and the Commission. I personally took the opportunity to call upon both the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries to proceed as quickly as possible with the ratification of this Convention, which will only enter into force when 40 countries have concluded their accession process. The European Union is, therefore, able to demonstrate its contribution to a worldwide fight against the trafficking of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Various speakers reminded us just now that, following the Dover tragedy last June, the Feira European Council called for measures to be adopted to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings. This initiative by the French Government therefore addresses this concern and the Commission has no difficulties in acknowledging that, in principle, it should be supported. We must, however, clarify the terms of the debate properly. Today, I have, or rather the Commission has, been accused of paying little attention to the issues of illegal immigration and, furthermore, of not paying sufficient attention to drafting a comprehensible immigration policy. I hope you will not be offended if I do not go into great detail, at 11.15 at night, in order to refute all the accusations and if I simply tell you sincerely that I do not consider these criticisms to be at all justified where the Commission is concerned. For example, our immigration policy does contain a security component. This component cannot be the main one, or exclusive, but we cannot ignore the fact that the trafficking of human beings is a serious problem, that also requires security measures. I am therefore surprised – I shall not say shocked, which is a very strong word – that Mr Berthu has only found one paragraph on illegal immigration in a Commission communication which seeks to address the issue of legal immigration and that he has not, for example, discovered that the Commission has presented two proposals for framework decisions. One of these proposals is intended to eliminate the trafficking of human beings for the purpose of exploitation, specifically to ban child pornography on the Internet. I am also surprised that Mr Berthu has not noticed that the Commission has presented a proposal for a framework decision to eliminate the trafficking of human beings for the purpose of economic exploitation, in other words, for the purpose of promoting illegal work.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, just as we agreed to discuss the French initiative, in which security features very prominently, the Commission has already initiated a discussion in the Council on a proposal for a communication on a European asylum system and a communication on legal immigration, in other words, on the rights and duties of third-country nationals who are allowed to enter the Union legally. We have tried to define a balanced policy but the contradictory criticisms that have been made in this House show that we may well not have achieved this yet. These criticisms have not convinced me, however, that the Commission is not on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two fundamental concerns about the French proposal, which make it difficult for us to accept the proposed text. Our first concern is about the legal basis, which is not a minor issue. We feel that the French initiative must be completely underpinned, notwithstanding its reference to aggravating circumstances, by a legal basis under the first pillar, such as the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 63(3)(b). It can clearly be inferred from this article of the Treaty that competence for illegal immigration has been given to the Community. It is also clear that the Community <span class="italic">per se</span> does not have Community competence in criminal issues. Nevertheless, I wish to remind Parliament that there is case-law from the Court of Justice of the European Communities which indicates that, in cases in which the Community, within a clearly defined jurisdiction, has power conferred upon it by the Treaties to regulate activity in order to achieve a Community objective, it also has the power to decide whether the fact that this activity does not comply should be punished at national level by criminal sanctions. This, as I see it, is especially true in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second concern involves the scope of Article 1(a) of the draft directive. In its current wording and as matters stand today, this measure in the French proposal contains no reference to the objective of financial gain. The Commission is willing to study this approach, in other words, not to lay down the requirement of financial gain, but this would have to be balanced by a carefully worded exemption clause for cases where illegal entry, movement and residence are subject to assistance for humanitarian reasons. This is the only way it will be possible to distinguish clearly between humanitarian assistance under international commitments, specifically respect for the Geneva Convention, and the trafficking of human beings which is punishable by law.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude, Mr President, by saying that the Commission feels that other elements must be included in the French proposal, such as, for example, establishing an obligation for administrative coordination and cooperation between the competent national departments, creating a system for the exchange of information between Member States and imposing the obligation on Member States to adopt the appropriate measures to provide humanitarian assistance to illegal immigrants. I wish to make one final comment, which is that, in line with the Tampere conclusions and the Commission ‘scoreboard’, we have presented a proposal for a framework decision on combating the trafficking of human beings. We would therefore like the joint work of the Council, Parliament and the Commission to show clearly that there is no overlap between the French initiative and the two framework decisions presented by the Commission, but rather complementarity. These framework decisions are part of the broader issue of the fight against illegal immigration, which involves a proactive policy of legal immigration under the terms proposed by the Commission in its communication issued last November. Of course, this also involves other complementary policies that the Commission intends to propose to the Council in May, specifically on the issue of a policy of return and of the conditions for sending citizens from third countries back to their country of origin. I hope that the conclusions of the informal Stockholm Council meeting last week will enable us, at the Laeken European Council, to take stock of this debate on a common immigration policy and on a European asylum system which respect our international obligations and which guarantee the stability and security of the Union’s Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
