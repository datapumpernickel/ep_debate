That corresponds to around 17% of municipal solid waste and 3% of the total waste generation by weight. Of these 65 million tonnes, 34 million tonnes – 53% – were recycled, and 60% was recovered or incinerated with energy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Our information gives good reason to assume that in 2002 not a single target out of the 75 different targets applying to Member States was missed. This is a success many would not have believed in even a few years ago. Therefore the Community has built on this success and adopted new and higher targets earlier this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States started later in setting up their own recycling schemes. They have nevertheless made significant progress towards fulfilling their target under the old packaging directive at the end of the transition periods agreed in the Accession Treaty. For procedural reasons, a deadline for the targets of the revised packaging directive could not be set within that directive and this proposal was therefore necessary. The Commission believes that setting this deadline for the new Member States is a matter in which Parliament needs to be fully involved. We therefore consider that the appropriate legal procedure is codecision on the basis of Article 95.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also understand, however, that the new Member States want to have legal security as soon as possible. They should be able to transpose the targets of the revision directive and the deadline under the present proposal at the same time. The deadline therefore needs to be agreed before the transposition deadline for targets expires in August 2005 and I hope that the efforts made to reach an agreement at first reading will be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a deadline of 2012 for all new Member States. This should allow discussion in Parliament and Council to start from an equal basis. However, I can also accept limited postponement for some of the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also aware that many Members of Parliament wish to extend possibilities for Member States to encourage re-use systems. This is an important subject and the Commission agreed to study options during the last revision of the packaging directive. However, getting the right balance between encouraging re-use and preserving the internal market is also not easy. I think, therefore, that we should wait for the outcome of the two ongoing studies and discuss this issue on the basis of a report that the Commission will present to Parliament and the Council in 2005. However, if Parliament wishes to point out the importance of re-use in a recital, as suggested in Amendment 4, that is acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2 and 3 in full, and Amendment 4 in principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Wallström, this being your last debate as Commissioner for the Environment, I should like to congratulate you on your sterling work over the past five years, your significant personal involvement and commitment, and to thank you for the good cooperation which you have established with this House. You have been an excellent Environment Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, we are discussing the leftovers<span class="italic"> </span>of the revision of the Packaging Directive. The ten new countries need clear objectives. Recycling and reuse cannot be announced out of the blue from the capital or from Brussels. It takes time to persuade people to set up systems. That is why it seems best to retain the dates proposed by the new Member States themselves. Needless to say, I also checked out how the Members from the new countries felt about this, and this has not produced any other viewpoints. Hence my proposal for Amendment No 3.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission that we need to finalise this issue as quickly as possible and that we must try to create political clarity for the new Member States at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, the Packaging Directive is due for a general overhaul. One of the crucial points is the constant tension between, on the one hand, maintaining the internal market and, on the other hand, protecting the environment. In a number of cases, this has led to ambiguity and to long drawn-out procedures. Clarity must be created, for the sake of both manufacturers and consumers. On the basis of the Packaging Directive, which also covers the environment, the European Commission has called into question a number of reuse systems in Europe. Commissioner, that is very disappointing in my view and I have decided to focus on this revision.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 4, on behalf of my group, I have suggested including in the directive the possibility of Member States encouraging the reuse of packaging material. Member States can introduce new systems for the reuse of packaging material or, alternatively, maintain existing systems if these yield an environmental advantage compared to recycling or recovery from packaging material. This amendment, which is also a recital, does not say that Member States <span class="italic">must</span> encourage reuse. It states that Member States can promote reuse, provided that – and that is important – that is done in compliance with the Treaty and does not disrupt the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">You said, Commissioner, that you could accept this amendment, and I understand that it does not meet with any great resistance in the Council either. It is therefore beyond me that even this has provoked objections among the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and within the European packaging industry. The reaction from the PPE-DE and the industry is simply bewildering if we stop and think about the state of the environment and nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The follow-up report to the recently-published report by the Club of Rome concludes that the limits of sustainable development are in sight. If we are not careful with natural resources, such as water and energy, the two worlds, the world of nature and the world of human civilisation, will clash. We have not sufficiently succeeded in integrating sustainable development in our production and in our patterns of consumption. Clearly, we need to make a complete change. The reuse of materials and carefulness with natural resources are vitally important. That too is the background to Amendment No 4.</p>
<p class="contents">A packaging industry which itself objects to the possibility of encouraging reuse within the borders of the internal market is not facing the future. By 2010, European industry must be the world’s most competitive economy. This requires businesses that can assess social reality. It requires businesses that can turn sustainability into a trademark, businesses that realise that citizens and consumers are worried about the future of the planet and are prepared to make their contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Industry is right, of course, in saying that reuse should not be a front for protectionism. Reuse may not be an excuse for thwarting foreign suppliers. Similarly, reuse is not in all cases better for the environment, and there is no reason for making reuse compulsory. Reuse does fulfil an important role, though, that being persuading people that we need to be careful with nature and with materials.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing we need is to start reverting to being a throwaway society, not, incidentally, that the public appreciate that anyway, because many people consider discarding anything a waste, a waste of a bottle, a can or the material. Tomorrow, this Parliament will also be discussing the Kok report on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. Mr Wim Kok has concluded that the pursuit of a sustainable society, one in which man, the environment and the market are in harmony, has, although commendable, not been given due prominence, and that this is due to a lack of political will. He is not saying, though, that we should throw out the Lisbon strategy altogether, and I agree with him. We must set to it and demonstrate political will.</p>
<p class="contents">In all its modesty, this packaging dossier will provide you with the opportunity of showing your political will tomorrow. Not only can we speak out in the resolution about what is yet to be done, we can also speak out in favour of a concrete, sustainable supplement to the Packaging Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I urge all of you to nail your colours to the mast tomorrow. The choice is yours: a voice for a Europe that is striving towards a sustainable society and acts accordingly, or a voice for a Europe that is full of fine words about sustainable development and the Lisbon strategy, but lacks the energy or moral fibre to back these up with vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström, communication is your new key task in the European Commission. You have said that your intention is to continue to spread and promote the message of sustainable development. You have my heartfelt support in this, and I wish you much success in this respect. I hope that after the vote on the Packaging Directive tomorrow, you will be able to point out to the press that Europe not only speaks about sustainability, it also acts on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the negotiation of the modification of the directive on packaging, for which Mrs Corbey was also rapporteur, the problem was raised of what to do about the new Member States not included in the objectives of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States negotiated transitional periods with the Commission of differing lengths according to their capacity to comply with these objectives or not, because, in reality, for many countries, these objectives are very ambitious and not at all easy to comply with. These time limits were laid down in Recital 6 of the modification of the directive carried out last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the report as approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and in Amendment No 3 the rapporteur has replaced the date proposed by the Commission, a single date for everybody, which, as you are well aware, is 2012, as negotiated by the Member States. They may not agree but, in reality, each Member State has its own specific characteristics, its own problems, and is perfectly aware of when it can achieve these objectives or not. There is no point in producing legislation which is impossible to comply with. This proposal was intended to include the Member States in the objectives of the directive on packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I am opposed to the new Amendment No 4, which is intended to introduce a new recital on the system of reuse, which gives the impression that the intention is to take advantage of one thing in order to impose another. This is not the time. I am not against systems of reuse, and nobody can be against it. But this is not the place to put this amendment. It is neither the time nor the place, particularly given that Article 5 of this directive already allows the Member States to promote methods of reuse provided that they conform to the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is premature to open up this debate when in June the Commission will have to present Parliament and the Council with a report on the application of the directive, its impact on the environment and the operation of the external market. Amongst other issues, this report will have to deal with promoting reuse and, in particular, compare the costs and benefits of reuse and recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">So far no environmental or economic reason has been found to favour one type of packaging over another. The most important thing I wanted to say is that I am against Amendment No 4. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objectives in the field of waste treatment to which the new Member States committed themselves during the accession negotiations are not a simple matter for the majority. This also applies to the various types of waste packaging set out in the European Union directive of 1994. </p>
<p class="contents">All the new Member States have asked for transition periods to be granted. As we know, the Directive was revised during the accession negotiations and higher standards for waste treatment were introduced. </p>
<p class="contents">In order for the Member States to remain within the realm of what can realistically be achieved, it was logical that they had to receive new, extended transition periods. It is those transition periods that we are discussing today. </p>
<p class="contents">At present the new Member States are establishing their systems for dealing with waste packaging and in this respect the next three years will be crucial. Let these systems have high standards from the ecological point of view, but they must also be achievable and economically acceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the new Member States are pooling their previous experience and following the experiences of others in the area of legislative options. This entails the use of 'examples of best practice', which they wish to repeat, as well as the use of unsuccessful experiments, which they wish to avoid. </p>
<p class="contents">In any case they will attempt to integrate various methods and to influence manufacturers to make packaging functional and, at the same time, safe and acceptable to consumers. </p>
<p class="contents">The method for recycling packaging set out in Article 5 of the original Directive is one of the methods we wish to consider. My own country, Slovenia, supports recycling, as it is logical both from the environmental and the economic standpoint. </p>
<p class="contents">It has not been possible, however, to overlook the fact that the interpretation of Article 5 of the original Directive has been the subject of numerous complaints as well as legal proceedings. </p>
<p class="contents">So Parliament and the Council called on the Commission to prepare the statement which we have heard today, a statement that would examine various aspects of the effects on the environment and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political group is happy with the extended deadlines restored to the new Member States by the recommendation in the revised Directive. </p>
<p class="contents">Taking all the various elements into account, we have reached the decision that it is reasonable if the wording is limited to its original purpose and we do not include anything that is in the process of development or is the subject of expert analysis and current proceedings in the European Court. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know we are going to miss her very much and would like to extend our thanks to her. I should also like to thank Mrs Corbey for her report. This is a very important subject, which makes a real difference to our environment. It is an issue that constituents feel extremely strongly about.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two key issues in Mrs Corbey's report. Firstly the dates. I understand very well why the rapporteur is proposing slightly later dates than the Commission. Our Group, the Verts/ALE, can<span class="bold"> </span>certainly go along with that, with the proviso that we believe we need to be very careful that these compliance time gaps between older and newer Member States begin to start closing afterwards. As we have seen before, these gaps have in some cases actually got wider over time, so we need to make sure that over time they begin to close. On balance, however, we can accept the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key issue is Amendment 4, to which many other speakers have referred. We have great sympathy with what Mrs Corbey is trying to achieve with this amendment. The rapporteur is trying to safeguard Dutch national provisions on re-usable packaging. I would point out that at first reading, Green amendments were aimed specifically at enabling national re-use schemes to proceed, but on that occasion we unfortunately did not secure a big enough majority to get that through.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens strongly support re-use as an important way to reduce the environmental impact of packaging, but we share the reservations expressed by others about trying to tackle that in this directive by amending a recital. We appreciate the motivation, but we do not think this is the right place to do that. We are not sure anyway how an amendment will support the Dutch case, since it does not amend the current legislation. We are not convinced that this recital would have an impact on the Netherlands, since this legislation appears to be much more applicable to the ten new Member States than to the 'old' Member States. Even if it were applicable, I am not sure how much further forward it would take us. The main difference between what we already have in Directive 94/62/EC on re-use and what the rapporteur would like to introduce is a slight reinforcement of the level of encouragement to re-use. But given that the amendment is just to a recital, I do not see how it really strengthens the existing legal possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly urge that we use all our efforts to promote re-use over recycling and recovery when we come to the full review of the packaging directive next year. I look forward to a strong Commission proposal next summer. That will be the right time to ensure that we give re-use the priority it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both the North and South of Ireland, similar directives are having a positive impact and changing both government practice and public mindsets with respect to domestic and commercial waste management. Much work remains to be done, but we now have many good examples to learn from, including innovative ideas on reuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to stress the importance of deadlines for ensuring that Member States reach the targets agreed by the EU, and this includes deadlines for the newest Member States. At local government level in Ireland we have directives which show that recycling brings with it the notion of local authorities, from Belfast to Dublin, actively pursuing new forms of waste management, while at the same time government departments have been moved to concentrate their efforts as a result of these directives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, that those countries which joined the European Union in June 2004 are treated fairly. I therefore support Mrs Corbey and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with respect to the amendments on this point. This is not about delay: it is about clarity, effectiveness and fairness. We need deadlines, but we also need clarity and fairness for all. On that basis the original agreement on dates should stand. It is also extremely important for us to ensure that countries can pursue policies on reuse and that we do not close down any possibilities in this respect.</p>

Under this directive, draconian regulations have been imposed on Northern Ireland. We now have the ludicrous requirement that a DIY retailer, for example, who buys in packaged goods and sells them on, is required to make returns detailing the net weight of the packaging of all such goods passing through his business, even though he never opens or discards any of the packaging. He is then liable to what amounts to a waste tax for merely handling the goods and, in addition, has to waste time and effort on trying to assess the weight of the packaging. I am therefore glad that the accession states are being spared this lunacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with some surprise that the Republic of Ireland, although a long-established EU Member State, has also been permitted to defer full compliance until the beginning of 2012. Sadly, the United Kingdom did not seek equal derogation, so we are beset with the foolish regulations I have described.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also somewhat surprised that the last speaker seems ignorant of the fact that there are different provisions in the Republic of Ireland and that it has been granted an extension and deferment until the end of 2011. Perhaps if she concentrated more on the documents, rather than speaking in a language that no one cares to understand, she might not have made such a fundamental mistake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were certainly under the impression that the dates mentioned in the preamble to the directive, as it was finally adopted, were the dates that would apply to the accession states. I therefore have some questions for the Commissioner. It is very nice to see her here for what must be one of her last debates as Environment Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, have the accession states requested these earlier dates? They are embarrassingly close to the Irish dates. Ireland, as we know, has been looking at this legislation for many years and has done absolutely nothing about it. Were these earlier dates that the Commission is proposing actually requested by the new Member States? If not, on what basis have they been decided?</p>
<p class="contents">Second, are they based on any cost impact assessment? There must be some additional cost between the dates that the new Member States wanted and the dates the Commission is proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these dates show the way in which the Commission operates. It sees much of this legislation as aspirational. As my colleague Mr Allister has said, we see it as legal texts that are put into operation. If we are not very careful, we will find a mass of used packaging being exported from the European Union to China and elsewhere in order to escape this situation. So could we please have those answers from the Commission? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The key to achieving our ambitions in the area of the recycling and recovery of packaging waste is setting attainable targets based on realistic expectations. There is no point in setting a deadline that cannot be achieved and triggering the inevitable infringement procedures. As Mrs Corbey rightly points out in her report – and I thank her for her work – it is only fair and equitable that the same approach be taken with regard to our colleagues in the new Member States, as was indicted to them during the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Shifting the finishing line and imposing onerous time constraints at this stage would display a lack of good faith on our part as it unscrambles the hard-won result of the final trialogue on the revised directive earlier this year, as outlined in recital 6 to that directive, which I understood to list, for each new Member State, the date relating to the derogation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our debate should focus not on argument about timetables, but on the reduction of the overall level of packaging and packaging waste through recycling and recovery. I would like to emphasise that the derogations in question are from the timetable and not from the substantive targets. This is an important distinction which demonstrates that we are not supporting a shirking of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In advance of the Commission's report on the implementation of the original directive next June, I can report that a sensible policy of realistic derogation has already proved a success in my own country, and I hope Mrs Jackson will take note of what I am about to say. We have a specific problem of demographics, geography and lack of infrastructure, and no indigenous packaging industry, with 80% of our packaged goods being imported. Ireland has no energy recovery or incineration facilities so all our targets have to be met through recycling alone. However, we have seen the rate of recycling of packaging waste increase steadily from 93 000 tonnes in 1998 to just over 414 000 tonnes in 2003. This represents over 45% of the packaging waste on the Irish market, all of which would previously have gone to landfill. We have achieved our 2001 target of recycling 25% of packaging and we are well on our way to achieving the 2005 target of a 50% recycling rate thanks to proper, sensible timelines and derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a clear shift in the public mindset in relation to recycling in Ireland. 61% of adults visit their local Bring Centre at least once a month, as opposed to only 25% in 1998. Bringing about this change has taken – and will continue to take – time, effort and investment, a fact that is reflected in the 2011-2012 timetable set in the revised packaging directive for Greece, Portugal and Ireland. I was the author of that particular amendment and I thank my colleagues for their support. The same type of derogation and the same argument should apply to our colleagues in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our quest for better regulation as a Parliament must start with enforceable legislation. If we are to set unreasonable objectives for recycling and recovery of packaging waste which take no account of capacity constraints, we might just as well get it over with now, book our slot in advance at the ECJ for non-implementation and spare the Commission a waste of envelopes on letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to put on record my disappointment at Mr Allister's comment on Mrs de Brún speaking a language 'no one cares to understand'. It may well not be the time or place to speak in Irish, but I do not think that derogatory and disparaging remarks about anyone's language, albeit a minority language, have any place in this House and I take exception to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the enlarged Europe we now find ourselves in a situation in which the common targets set to achieve harmonised legislation are particularly stringent for the newest Member States, and perhaps more so than ever before. In this sense, the proposal for a Directive on packaging and packaging waste is not exceptional.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of this directive must be based on the guarantee of an internal market that is as viable as possible without any risk of distortions. This is easier said than done. The area of the internal market has expanded, and there are perhaps greater differences in the basic standards of Member States than ever before. The Commission’s proposal to lay down a common deadline of December 2012 for the new Member States regarding recovery and recycling targets under the packaging waste directive can be justified for market convergence to be achieved as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal, however, is not without its problems. Consequently, it might well be prudent to take the long view and take basic standards in the new countries into greater consideration when setting the deadline. This way we will avoid any embarrassing repercussions that result from breaches of the conditions set and at the same time give priority to European convergence instead of market harmonisation which is now being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been much discussion in connection with the reading of the Directive on the recycling and recovery of packaging waste. The ecological value of reuse is incontestable. It should be realised, however, that the environmental friendliness of reused packaging is not always directly justifiable. For short transportation journeys it certainly is preferable, but problems arise when each producer has its own packaging and internal distances in the European market are long. A good example is the transportation of fruit from the countries in the south to the Nordic countries, where the retransportation of reused packaging would not promote sustainable development at all. For example, cardboard boxes and cartons are often collected and recycled locally, to avoid a large number of unnecessary journeys. Promoting reused packaging whilst ignoring environmental considerations would be ecologically hypocritical. From the point of view of the report under discussion now, it would be good if the objective of coherent adaptation were not unnecessarily compromised by vague reuse systems of packaging at national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, Mrs Jackson, as you know, our proposal suggests a deadline of 31 December 2012 for all the new Member States. The amendment confirms the deadline for seven new Member States, but allows a deadline of 2013 for Malta, 2014 for Poland and 2015 for Latvia. In reply to your question, this reflects the wishes the new Member States expressed to the Commission in the consultation round in spring 2003. A recital in the revised directive states that the deadline to be agreed should not be later than those dates. It is also my understanding that no agreement was reached in conciliation on a particular date. The recital indicated specifically that the decision should be taken on the basis of requests from the acceding states for derogations, which would not in principle extend beyond the dates mentioned. So there is nothing to suggest that the date could not be earlier. The Commission considers that this matter should be debated openly, treating all countries equally. We have no problem in accepting differentiated dates, if that is what Parliament and the Council want.</p>
<p class="contents">On the costs, we do not anticipate any significant change. There will be no dramatic change in costs if the dates are changed.</p>
