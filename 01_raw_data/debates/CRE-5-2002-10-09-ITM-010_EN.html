<p class="contents">Mr President, this important piece of legislation is a direct consequence of the Green Paper on security of supply, which the Commission originally presented, and which gave rise to a lively debate at European level on this issue which is essential to our competitiveness and well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive, which is now happily to see the light, represents a significant qualitative change in relation to previous attempts to achieve the same objectives based exclusively on coordination and voluntary application.</p>
<p class="contents">This time the Commission is bravely establishing a binding framework which will undoubtedly lead to an homogenisation of best practices in the fifteen Member States. Mr President, I must also express my particular satisfaction, which is shared by the whole of the Industry Committee, with the Council’s receptiveness to all of Parliament’s contributions: the principle of individual charging, differentiated treatment between existing buildings and new buildings, the clear definition of exemptions, special attention to social housing, the growing importance of passive cooling in southern countries, where air conditioning systems are increasingly contributing to our energy consumption, and, of course, the emphasis on incentive mechanisms rather than penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to assess the importance of this piece of legislation we must bear in mind that 40% of the Union’s energy expenditure is consumed in buildings, which in quantitative terms means EUR 100 000 million per year; 2.5 % of our total imports and 0.5 % of our Gross Domestic Product. There can therefore be no doubt that this directive, which will be followed by others that the Commission has already launched, will represent an extremely important advance, on the one hand in terms of compliance with the Union’s environmental objectives and, on the other, with regard to guaranteeing the security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been one point on which the Council, on the one hand, and Parliament and the Commission, on the other, have had to iron out certain differences. I am talking about the period for the implementation of this essential directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the Council’s view – perhaps with arguments which we cannot agree with, but which may be understandable – that once the 36 months for transposition into national legislations had elapsed, there should be four additional years for this directive to become fully operational; this took us beyond 2008; and 2008 is a symbolic year since it is then that the period for verification of the Kyoto commitments begins. This was not therefore acceptable to Parliament: either in terms of energy saving or in symbolic terms. And therefore, in the end, as we usually do in the European institutions, we reached a compromise agreement and this additional period was set at three years.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Mr President, that we can be very satisfied and we can congratulate the Commissioner and her team on this great contribution to the Union’s energy policy, all my colleagues in the Industry Committee for the great support I have received, the secretariat of the committee for their excellent technical work and, as I said before, we must thank the Council for their receptiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would firstly like to thank Mr Vidal-Quadras and the members of the Industry Committee for the great help they have given me throughout the discussion of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative has arisen in the context of the debate on the Green Paper, and furthermore it responds to both the wishes of Parliament and the conclusions of the Council, which demanded actions to improve energy efficiency, specifically in buildings, with the aim of taking advantage of the potential for energy savings.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Vidal-Quadras said quite rightly, we are talking about 40% of Europe’s total energy consumption and according to our analysis and studies, there is a potential for improvements in efficiency of around 22%; in other words, in terms of the global energy mix, we are talking about the possibility for improvement of close to 8%.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, all of us, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, believe that this is one of the key proposals in terms of trying to comply with our international commitments, and in particular our Kyoto commitments on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission’s proposal is simply the adoption by the Member States of a common methodology for the energy performance of buildings. Secondly, the establishment of minimum requirements for energy performance and their application in new buildings as a general rule, with certain small exceptions, and in existing buildings of more than one thousand square metres when these are subject to significant renovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the certification of the energy performance of buildings at the point of construction, sale or rent, because another important element is the rights of consumers who rent an apartment, house or building without knowing what the real cost of energy for that building will eventually be.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, an essential additional element is the periodic inspection of boilers and air conditioning systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that Parliament established its position at first reading in February 2002 and the great majority of its amendments have been included in the common position. These amendments suggested by Parliament – I insist – have improved the Commission’s original text, without changing its objective, and in some cases have added new important elements such as the requirement in terms of assessment and information.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental problem between the Council and Parliament, as Mr Vidal-Quadras has said, was the transitional period prior to obligatory application. I believe that the compromise which has finally been achieved, three years for transposition into national legislations, plus another three to make its full application obligatory, is reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the five amendments presented, from No 8 to No 12, are generally faithful to the spirit of the Commission’s original proposal, since an acceptable and feasible balance has been achieved in the definition of the fields of work, typology and thresholds for action established in the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank Parliament, the committee and the rapporteur because I believe we have reached an agreement precisely thanks to this will to find a balance between the positions of Parliament and of the Council, on the basis of the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this House can vote to approve this text at tomorrow’s sitting, and that it can therefore be applied in the Member States as soon as possible. It will thereby contribute to improving the European Union’s energy efficiency in an effective way, in accordance with our international commitments. We all know that we have made very serious commitments and that we must make the necessary efforts to ensure that these are not just stated ambitions but also tangible realities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think it is crucial to provide information about the state of the EU’s energy demand when it comes to energy consumption in the housing and tertiary sectors. This applies all the more at a time when the threat of global warming hangs over our future. Of course, we must also add to this the problem of our dependence on outside sources of energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a directive which will, as a result of the four following instruments: the methodology for calculating the integrated energy performance of buildings, the application of minimum energy performance requirements to new buildings and to buildings undergoing renovations and the establishment of a system of energy performance certification, I believe, increase consumer information and encourage owners to invest in improving energy performance, which is in both their interest and that of their tenants. The particular notice system that we wish to put in place will enable us not only to keep citizens informed about this energy performance, but also to give public authorities an exemplary role in the field. It is therefore a text that constitutes a considerable qualitative leap in relation to the SAVE programme, because it has a restrictive nature that will give us total credibility with regard to the Kyoto challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank both the Commission and the Council which have, fortunately, abandoned the approach of voluntary measures in favour of that of a genuine piece of European legislation, which will alone guarantee results as well as uniform implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">No one could think that this directive imposes constraints and an excessive burden on the construction sector. We maintain on the contrary that this is an opportunity for industry, for research and the consumer and represents a genuine boost for research into insulating material and heating and air-conditioning systems. Eventually, European industry will have considerable expertise in the field of the energy performance of buildings, which will enhance its modernisation and its competitiveness. We shall, at the same time, be extremely careful to undertake an evaluation and to ensure a usage that is geared more towards housing for the most disadvantaged members of society. Might we perhaps be able to hope that the first experimental models will be the buildings of the European Union itself?</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you also for the clarity and the transparency of the work undertaken with the Commission, and above all for the close attention the Council has paid.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote in favour of this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have aimed at the target of improved energy efficiency in buildings for some years, in the climate change programme amongst others. Some measures, such as the thermal insulation of new buildings, are indeed already provided for under the same programme. However, these were not binding on the Member States. In general, Community programmes have failed to result in the actual application of standards of energy efficiency in many Member States, so this directive, although modest, is indeed a step forward, a building block, if you like.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur was correct to point out that in view of the Kyoto timetable, we must be careful not to invalidate the directive by a long transition period, particularly for certification in specific areas. I congratulate him again on reaching a useful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to add my voice to those who plea that we do something realistic about energy savings in Parliament buildings and in EU buildings in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
