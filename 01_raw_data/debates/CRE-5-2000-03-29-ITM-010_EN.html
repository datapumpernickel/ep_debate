<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klamt (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, child sex tourism is not a national or a European problem, it is a global problem which has become more and more explosive and more and more extensive over recent years. The motion for a resolution which has been tabled takes account of this fact. It no longer has a selective, national or European dimension. The worrying increase in the number of cases of sexual exploitation of children shows that the European Union and its Member States need to use every means at their disposal in order to protect the weakest members of our society, i.e. children. The motion for a resolution therefore contains two central demands.</p>
<p class="contents">First: unilateral criminality should apply in cases of child sex tourism; that means that even if the country in which the offence is committed does not punish sexual abuse, it must nonetheless be possible to prosecute offenders in their country of origin. Secondly: account must be taken of the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction. We need standard national legislation throughout Europe which punishes Union citizens who engage in child sex tourism, irrespective of where the offence was committed. Europe must take responsibility for its citizens, even beyond its borders.</p>
<p class="contents">These demands can be succinctly summarised: children are no less deserving of protection because their home country denies them the necessary protection, and there is all the more reason not to turn a blind eye to incidents within the European Union. Each of us knows of cases of child abuse in our own country. The Council and Commission have indeed supported the principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, but these drafts still allow for the criterion of dual criminality in exceptional cases. In other words, in exceptional cases, it would still be possible for sex tourists who have abused children to escape punishment if the country in which the offence was committed does not punish child abuse. The European Parliament flatly rejects this regulation on possible exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must be proactive in opposing anything which encourages or plays down child sex tourism. Respect for the rights of the child must be anchored in the European Treaties if we are to guarantee protection for children in principle. Measures taken so far must be examined to see how effective and efficient they really are and EU funds must also be made available in the future to fight child sex tourism. The role of NGOs is particularly important in this context. The Commission is called upon to draw up a survey of national laws in this sphere and, if necessary, to submit suitable proposals setting out the constituent elements of offences. All the points which it has now been decided should be regulated and taken into account in the future within the European Union must be given the same consideration in accession negotiations, in relations with third countries and, most importantly, when deciding how development cooperation funds should be deployed.</p>
<p class="contents">The freedoms and rights of citizens include freedom from physical and mental harm. This applies not only to our children but to all children. It is our duty to implement this with all the means at our disposal. Everyone involved agreed on this consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this resolution sets an example for constructive and fruitful cooperation which goes beyond the party political divide. I should therefore like to thank all my fellow Members, especially those from the other committees involved, whose positions have been worked into my report. This is also an explanation of the fact that numerous proposed amendments were rejected by my group. They are already contained in the report, even if some are formulated differently. I am convinced that this is a good, sensible resolution which will allow us to protect children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad, too, that the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights has been incorporated into the report. Child sex tourism does not take place only in Europe, but throughout the world. Child sex tourism is a tragic and distressing fact of life and this problem has become worse and more serious in certain regions of the world over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s approach to the fight against this evil must therefore go beyond the borders of Europe. In addition to the situation in the Far East, there is also that on the German-Czech border, which is why this problem needs to be clarified in no uncertain terms during accession negotiations. It is important to clarify the legal situation and to dispense with the notion of dual criminality. The law of the offenders’ country of origin must be binding for the purposes of criminal prosecution. Offenders should not imagine themselves to be safe in some law-free zone. It must be possible to punish offenders, even if abuse is not a punishable offence in the country in which it is committed. This problem cannot be solved through national measures. We need a common approach in the European Union and in the Member States, in cooperation with the third countries in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Children as persons with their own, inviolable rights deserve our special protection, irrespective of the country in which they live. This protection must be guaranteed in both theory and practice. Sufficient funds must be provided to support an effective, victim-orientated fight against this evil. In all the Member States of the European Union, the necessary legislative measures must be taken and the laws harmonised in order to guarantee the protection of children. Last but not least, protection of children as separate personalities with the right to freedom from physical and mental harm must be included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Swedish travel agents are to be the first in the world to actively combat the child sex trade, which is rife in many so-called tourist paradises. All the major players in the Swedish tourist industry have already promised to comply with a special code of conduct. Once they have shown that they are fulfilling the requirements of the code, they will be duly approved or certified. </p>
<p class="contents">As early as the beginning of April of this year, a campaign was begun to make travellers aware of what is happening. There are TV and cinema advertisements, posters at the airports and large placards. Behind the code of conduct lies the Swedish branch of ECPAT, an organisation which works to end the sexual exploitation of children. Among the requirements made of travel companies are that they should train their staff, both at home and at the resorts, as well as inform travellers. They are also to see to it that, for example, hotel owners and staff are aware of, and contribute to, the work being done to combat the child sex trade. It is about touching people’s consciences. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude my speech by talking about children – our greatest gift, the most precious thing we have. They are innocent and defenceless and they seek security. We must awaken citizens’ consciences where our children are concerned. I also want to talk about the sexual dimension to life. Adult society cannot escape from its failure to adequately foster an appreciation of both the wonder and the responsibility entailed in sexual experience. It is about showing love and tenderness, about the gift of life, about carrying life forward and about faithfulness. We must awaken citizens’ consciences regarding the place of love in our lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not only excellent in quality but also extremely useful. Everyone agrees on the idea that children are the future of the world but, at the same time, they represent one of the most vulnerable groups in the population of this planet. Indeed, the United Nations Convention of 20 November 1989 granted them specific rights and all our actions should take their inspiration from recognition of these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We must tackle a dreadful scourge, the sexual exploitation of children. There are ‘clients’, if one can use the word in such a horrifying situation, who buy children in order to indulge their sexual fantasies. These clients, from Europe, the United States or Japan are the hard core of child abusers. This horrendous phenomenon occurs principally in third countries where there is great poverty. The chief causes are poverty and social inequality, the collapse of family and community protection, discrimination against girls and ignorance. All these causes combine to form a melting pot where lives are shattered by the greed of some parties and the deviance of others.</p>
<p class="contents">We might remember the old Japanese proverb which says, ‘The traveller knows no shame’. Some people have no qualms about doing in another country what they would not do at home. It is a compound of anonymity and impunity coupled with a scorn one might describe as racist, which permits some individuals to treat a child as an object to be used, defiled and rejected. Most child prostitutes are part of the general prostitution market run by Mafias of procurers. It is very hard to locate these children and to extract them from a life of prostitution. Unfortunately, some individuals use the Internet to provide details of their base acts and addresses where children can be procured.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot remain indifferent to this scourge which represents an appalling infringement of children’s rights and human rights, and we must protect these children by attacking the origins of the problem and by pursuing the paedophiles. The origins of the problem can be attacked by tackling poverty and ignorance. There must be criminal penalties for child abusers. The first chapter of the European Charter on the Rights of the Child states that ‘child’ refers to any person under the age of 18. I suggest that we adopt this age limit and say that all minors must absolutely be protected. It is our duty to this generation which represents our future, a generation which expects us to protect and respect it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is in contributing to the construction of an international human rights community: in all kinds of ways there has been increasing recognition that Europe must promote international standards of respect for human rights, for instance in the international criminal tribunals on Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the agreement on the statute of the international criminal court, the Pinochet case, the intervention in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing – all these things have been developing momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">Saying that we will not allow our citizens to sexually exploit children abroad fits into that pattern, and the part of Mrs Klamt’s report that talks of how we must insist that double standards are unacceptable is very well put and particularly valuable. It is not acceptable that our citizens should behave abroad in a way that they would not behave at home.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this report makes a contribution to police and judicial cooperation in the European Union. This is a strong example where those Euro-sceptics who resist cooperation in this field are wrong. It is only by joint across-the-board action that we can tackle this issue, not least by agreeing to extra-territorial application of criminal laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Approximation and mutual recognition of national criminal provisions, which is not the same as harmonisation, will be of the utmost utility, as will cooperation through police forces and Europol, insisting all the time, as the Parliament does, on adequate parliamentary and judicial scrutiny. So I congratulate Mrs Klamt for a very valuable report and I hope it will continue to be built on in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I particularly recall measures such as the inclusion of children’s rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the setting up of free telephone helplines for children. There is an urgent need for a coherent policy for the protection of children to be implemented. I therefore support Amendment No 4 calling for a European centre for missing children and victims of sexual abuse to be set up in order to coordinate the activities of the organisations set up in the Member States. The Commission must undertake to actually establish this European database.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out that Parliament has already adopted resolutions on this subject. It must be noted that the proposals made have only been implemented in part. Much more effective measures are required. Finally, I must alert the House to the latest developments. It is now not just sex tourists who are travelling to third countries; we now have children being sent here, to Europe, like so many items sent by parcel post. Considering, then, the transnational nature of the problem, I think that we should demand that Europol supports national and transnational inquiries and gives an annual report of its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that she has produced a report which proposes practical solutions, as many of us wished, and I thank her for that. I also think that she has avoided the pitfalls of sexophobia, which was not lacking in some contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an extremely serious problem. The report is a good one, but I would not like to see it sabotaged or even drastically cut by one section of this House tomorrow, as I fear it will be. It is all very well to discuss the problem in the third world, but I believe, as previous speakers have said, that there are also major problems within the European Union, and I have just learnt that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has requested a separate vote on the important sections of this report. A separate vote means that some parts of the text may be removed. In particular, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking for the suggestion for the establishment of a committee of enquiry to be removed. I find that cause for extremely serious concern.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware, for we have already discussed this, of the seriousness of the situation in some countries within the Union, particularly in Belgium. As I speak, the lid is being lifted on the infamous Dutroux case in the form of an excellent investigation on the Belgian national television station, RTBF. Unfortunately, I was not able to see the whole thing. It showed that the highest authorities in this country did all they could to hold up this inquiry by indulging in constant obstruction, transfers of police officers and magistrates and the defamation, and worse, of the victims who came forward to testify. These are extremely serious matters, involving high-ranking personalities, but it is all still perfectly concealed, completely outside the scope of the justice system.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we can and we must look at what is happening in the third world. We can and we must, and let me once again thank Mrs Klamt, propose solutions. I agree with Mrs Ludford: we must think in terms of institutions, in terms of an international court, and consider already extending the jurisdiction of international courts, but we must not neglect our own doorstep. There are some extremely serious situations within the European Union as well.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="underline">It is a matter of urgency that, pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union, in the event of a ‘serious and persistent breach (of the principles of) human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law’, the Union, and hence Parliament, which has a responsible part to play in this, should, at last, tackle, since the relevant Member State cannot, this very serious matter of the hundreds, nay thousands of missing children, including, as you know if you have seen the posters in railway stations and at bus stops, at least 150 children still missing in Belgium, who have been not only raped but also killed, sacrificed in the name of some dubious pleasure. </span></p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I think these tourists deliberately create this fantasy for themselves by way of an excuse for their misconduct. Why on earth would someone’s own moral standards suddenly change because they were in a different country? We need to look with a critical eye at how this could happen. Are the values and standards based on Christian and humanist tradition still alive and well in our decadent society?</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission’s actions, which aim to instil a sense of moral awareness. But that is not enough. This is about serious criminal offences, the perpetrators of which must be convicted. I urge the Council to apply the extra-territorial principle, with no concessions. </p>
<p class="contents">The criterion of dual criminality, which is still applied in a number of Member States, stipulates that any crime committed is only punishable if it is also punishable in the third country. Ironically, this rule dovetails neatly with the sex tourist’s delusion that the moral standards of their own country do not apply in another culture. This requirement must be abolished forthwith.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not support the demand for a legal basis for a European policy on children. This discussion does not belong in this report on the world-wide problem of child sex tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karamanou (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, the matter addressed by Mrs Klamt’s truly excellent report is one of the most burning and ever growing issues of our time, to which a solution must urgently be found. Of course, the Commission’s initiatives, especially the activities to increase awareness, should not be underestimated but unfortunately they are proving to be inadequate since the sexual exploitation of children and child tourism are continually assuming greater dimensions, not only in ‘traditional’ underdeveloped countries but within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urgently need an integrated and cohesive Community policy on children and it is really sad – as others too have said – that the Treaty of Amsterdam does not provide the necessary legal base. Yet, the provision for the creation of a new area of freedom, security and justice in the immediate future, which presupposes police and judicial cooperation in combating international organised crime, reinforces our hopes of a more effective approach to those circles which both supply and demand child sex services. For that reason, it is vital to include the rights of children, exactly as they are laid down by the UN Convention of 20 November 1989, in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need legislation which is binding on an extra-territorial scale, to punish culpable acts perpetrated abroad, with strict provisions for the prosecution of travel agencies and haulage companies which promote the abomination of child sex tourism. We need more resources for the implementation of specific schemes, and we need closer cooperation between the Commission and the tourism industry to define codes of ethics. We should look towards the good example set by Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must also act to protect and support children who are victims of sexual exploitation, and young refugees and immigrants who are a particularly vulnerable group. In summary, I think we need a common front and a common strategy at three levels. Firstly, at the level of awareness, secondly, at the level of suppression, and thirdly, in the direction of protection and rehabilitation of victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, in November 1996, the European Commission adopted its first communication on combating child sex tourism. A year later, in November 1997, a European Parliament resolution and a Council statement on ‘Tourism’ revealed the general consensus among the institutions on the broad lines of the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, this support has been implemented in practical terms by the setting up of a new budget line, with the funds made available intended for campaigns to raise awareness, within the European Union, and to combat the development of child sex tourism. It has since been expressed in the Council conclusions of 21 December 1999, which display a new firm political commitment to resolving this significant social problem, which we are pledged to do. If, as it is to be hoped, the European Parliament reiterates its support for this approach, then this will strengthen the determination of all the operators involved in combating this scourge. At the same time, further progress in this direction will contribute to our response to the concerns expressed by European citizens at the development of this scourge.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Klamt’s report follows up the Commission communication of May 1999 presenting the operations carried out in the period 1997-1998 and specifying follow-up operations necessary to initiate and/or implement new actions.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have noted that Community measures combating child sex tourism is progressing at a sustained rate along the lines of the strategy initially agreed, aiming, on the one hand, to reduce demand, particularly by means of cooperation with the tourist industry and the relevant NGOs, and, on the other hand, to tackle the sources of supply in tourist destination countries by any appropriate means, including Community policies for external relations and development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of this second aspect was, moreover, highlighted by the Commission as early as 1998 when the support strategy for the development of sustainable tourism in developing countries was defined, which stipulated that the problem of child sex tourism should be taken into specific consideration as the subject of structured political dialogue with the countries most affected, particularly at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of child sex tourism flies in the face of the very idea of a human community united on the basis of ideals such as respect and dignity, and public welfare and remembrance. Furthermore, it could be said that, rather than fuelling the ‘regulation versus self-regulation’ debate, the need for efficiency requires us to concentrate on investigating and maximising the use of the synergies between these two modes of operation which, in the case in point, are broadly complementary. Especially since, alongside the progress made towards effective self-regulation, i.e. including mechanisms to monitor the execution of commitments made, the development of police and judicial cooperation in Europe cannot fail to have a positive effect on the suppression of child sex tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council joint action of 24 February 1997 on combating the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, stipulating that each Member State should undertake to review its own national legislation on measures relating to types of deliberate behaviour, is exemplary in this regard. The fact that it is actually possible to be prosecuted by the authorities of two countries, in exceptional circumstances, must not disguise the main contribution of this joint action, to wit, affirming the principle of extra-territorial jurisdiction applicable to one of its nationals or to a person usually resident on its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore easier to understand the great interest generated by legislative reforms on the subject, as well as their practical interpretation, in terms of the everyday application of the legislation, hence the importance which the European Parliament attaches to assessing the degree to which the Member States actually meet their obligations under this joint action. This assessment may provide the opportunity to focus on suppressing child sex tourism, and to draw up an initial status report.</p>
<p class="contents">In operational terms, the raft of planned operations has been implemented steadily. Combating child sex tourism offers the Commission an opportunity to enlist its various services to step up internal coordination. It also affords the Commission the opportunity to step up its cooperation with the national administrations, professional associations and non-governmental organisations involved. Other Commission initiatives in the context of the increased involvement of the tourist industry have also had practical results, particularly in terms of drawing up and strengthening codes of conduct and other self-regulatory mechanisms in the tourist industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you are aware, your support will give us further incentive to pursue this avenue with yet more determination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
