<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morillon (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 13 December 1999, the Helsinki European Council decided to grant Turkey the status of applicant country for accession to the European Union and to set up an accession partnership and a single financial framework in order to help Turkey’s application progress in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the spirit in which the preparatory work for this report was carried out within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and I should like, at this point, to thank all my fellow members for the contribution they made towards finalising this report, which, like the Commission, concludes that Turkey does not currently fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We must applaud the remarkable efforts Turkey has made, since the Helsinki decision, in devising a programme to develop its judicial framework in order to meet EU demands in a more satisfactory manner, with particular regard to human rights. One example is the report drawn up under the responsibility of Mr Demirok, Secretary of the Turkish Supreme Coordination Council for Human Rights, who has proposed a very wide-ranging raft of reforms to the Constitution. However, we must also note and acknowledge that an awareness of the importance of these reforms has caused considerable upheavals in the various political parties and in Turkish public opinion. Turkish citizens are realising that Turkey’s accession to the EU will require not only the ‘painless’ revision of their institutions but also a partial renunciation of sovereignty, to which they remain jealously attached, and a radical change in habits and outlook.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why Parliament has proposed the setting up of a Europe-Turkey Forum involving expert representatives of the Turkish community and appointed MEPs who would consider in depth the issues involved. Turkish accession is too important a matter for the future of the Union and of Turkey itself for a decision to be taken in smoke-filled back rooms or behind closed doors. Lengthy debates will be needed, both in the European Parliament and in the national parliaments, and that is why it is generally accepted that the road will be long and difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of the Forum proposed by the European Parliament should allow us to overcome the initial obstacles encountered on this road. The European Parliament will have to tell its Turkish partners very clearly in the debates in that Forum that they need have no fear of any European desire to interfere in their internal affairs and that, on the contrary, it is proposing a contract, the precise details of which are being thrashed out, in the accession partnership, Commissioner, and, of course, in the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It will be up to the Turks to accept it or refuse it.</p>
<p class="contents">As matters stand, it is also up to the European Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are, today, at least three conditions for accession which Turkey must meet. Firstly, the need for identity must be respected: this need has been demonstrated particularly clearly in Europe by its citizens who wish to preserve their origins in the face of the ineluctable progress of globalisation. Aware that its diversity constitutes its wealth, Europe is determined to recognise this need for identity, and that is why it insists on the rights and also the obligations of minorities. It is in this spirit that it is prepared to help Turkey find a solution to the Kurdish problem in particular. The second problem, which will clearly have to be solved as soon as possible, concerns Cyprus. It is hard to understand today how it can remain divided by a wall, while in many other places, notably in Berlin and Sarajevo, and even more recently, between North and South Korea, such walls have crumbled over the past decade. Finally, since the fight against terrorism may now be deemed to be over, the influence of the Turkish army in the drawing up of political decisions should be gradually reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke of the three preconditions. In 1987, Parliament acknowledged the Armenian genocide. There are some people who would like to make the Turkish Government’s acknowledgement of this genocide a further condition for accession. This would run counter to the spirit and the letter of the process defined in Copenhagen for all candidate countries. I have suffered too much, alongside all the communities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the tragic consequences of the systematic resurrection of former atrocities to believe that a peaceful and stable future can be built except by ceasing to stir up the embers of past resentments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seppänen (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, of the two reports before us today, the one by Mr Morillon is more political in nature, whereas mine is more technical. The Council is proposing that Turkey be added to that group of countries that can be granted loans from the European Investment Bank, so that these credits may be backed by a European Union guarantee. The Council is proposing with unanimity that Turkey should join the group of recipients of guarantees, and Parliament’s Committee on Budgets is also unanimous in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Unanimity does not mean that we are all satisfied with the state of Turkish democracy or that country’s treatment of human rights; we are not. As Turkey has submitted its application for membership of the European Union, it will certainly be very aware of the criteria for membership as laid down at Copenhagen. As the European Union agreed at Helsinki that Turkey should join that group of countries with which membership would be negotiated, the human rights situation in Turkey is not just that country's internal affair. Through its application for membership, Turkey has given the Union the right to adopt a position on its internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a huge temptation to impose conditions on loans to Turkey, with reference to issues of democracy, but there has been no opportunity, technically speaking, to do so in this report. The issue here is just to supplement the earlier Council Decision 2000/2024/EC. If we had wanted to impose conditions they would have had to be imposed last year when the earlier decision was adopted. We did not know then that Turkey would be selected to join the group of recipients of guarantees, as a consequence of positive developments. Besides, conditions could not have been imposed exclusively by a decision of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus attention on how little Parliament is able to influence the work of the European Investment Bank and how badly the European Union monitors that work in general. The Guarantee Fund in the EU budget, which guarantees the loans to Turkey, comes under the category of compulsory expenditure, and the Council, as a result, did not need to take account of Parliament's positions. In the European Parliament we would in general like to impose conditions on European Investment Bank loans as far as environmental considerations and the social protection of the citizens of non-member countries are concerned, and, in the case of Turkey, this also concerns a respect for human rights. But the present legal basis for the Guarantee Fund does not make that possible. Better cooperation is needed between the institutions of the EU. The problems associated with the monitoring and examination of the management of the European Investment Bank also stem from the fact that there are only representatives of the Member States in its governing body, and some of them want to prevent the Commission and the European Parliament from taking a stand on bank matters. As a result, the European Investment Bank is one of the last havens in the world of banking. The ripples of social debate do not reach its shores.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to something the Commission already knows and, for that reason, I would like to draw the attention of the Council in particular to it. I refer to the fact that the 2001 Guarantee Fund is not large enough to meet all the commitments made. That may also be true for 2002. If we are to keep to these commitments, we must amend the residual reserve for guarantees. That is the only matter on which Parliament can give its legal opinion. The Council is granting more loans and offering guarantees than there are legal preconditions for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moscovici,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">.</span></span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, you requested a debate on the European Union’s relations with Turkey, and you are aware of the importance the Council attaches to strengthening this relationship, which has gained new currency since this country’s candidature was recognised in Helsinki. The debate on the two reports presented by Mr Morillon and Mr Seppänen comes at precisely the right moment, as the Commission has just submitted two very important reports to us, firstly, its latest report on the progress made by Turkey along the road to accession and, secondly, its proposal for an accession partnership agreement with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin, with your permission, with Mr Morillon’s extremely interesting report, which deals with the whole range of Euro-Turkish relations and, more specifically, with the progress report presented by the Commission in 1999, a few weeks prior to the Helsinki European Council. In recognising Turkey’s candidature, the European Council was following the recommendations made in the Commission’s report, whose analysis I believe we can all endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, both the European Union and Turkey have taken steps to put the Helsinki decisions into practice. I am, of course, thinking of the work undertaken within the Association Council with a view to bringing Turkish legislation into line with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. More especially, however, as indeed Mr Morillon pointed out, I am thinking of the efforts made by Turkey to adapt to European standards and practices, particularly in the area of respect for human rights and consolidation of the rule of law. There is still, as we are aware, a lot of work to be done, but I feel that Turkey is starting to get used to the idea of reforms. It is therefore up to us Europeans to support this country on its very long and difficult road to accession. In this respect, I have no doubt but that the determination of each and every one of us to help Turkey progress along the path of democratisation will in the end prevail. Who could do this better than the European Parliament? I can therefore only be delighted at the proposal you have made to establish a Europe-Turkey Forum of human rights, thereby enabling Turkish citizens to size up the European prospects being opened to them, as well as Europe’s requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I am of course aware that Turkey’s candidature continues to raise questions. I have noted reservations on the part of many people, not just within the European Parliament, but also in all the Member States. I have taken note of your wish, as expressed most clearly by Mr Morillon, to be fully involved in the destiny of Euro-Turkish relations. I wish to make myself perfectly clear on this point. I do not think that anyone is trying to dodge the issue in this respect, quite the opposite. A good many discussions have already taken place, right here in the European Parliament as well as within the national parliaments of Member States. These discussions have occasionally been difficult but also, I am convinced, profitable. For its part, the French Presidency has no intention of shirking this legitimate concern for transparency, information and debate. I feel that Mr Morillon’s excellent report bears witness to your determination to bring Turkey’s pre-accession process to a successful conclusion, while exercising the utmost vigilance, quite legitimately, regarding the still considerable reforms which this country has yet to undertake.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that negotiations cannot in any case commence, let me stress that fact, until Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria in full. That is why I took careful note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon regarding the preconditions for Turkey’s accession, which are certainly worth looking into. We are indeed all aware, yourselves, the Council Presidency and also, I believe, the Commission, whose latest report on the progress achieved in Turkey stressed once again the efforts this country still needs to made, the reforms still to be implemented in areas as crucial as respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and minority rights, in particular, areas in which, as we can only regret, progress is still too slow and even inadequate. We must, however, also beware, as your report wisely emphasises, of setting new, extravagant conditions on Turkish candidature.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress the fact that Turkey must be treated on an equal footing with the other candidates. It is, in my opinion, a fundamental principle which was laid down Helsinki, and one which must govern the strengthening of Euro-Turkish relations. For, generally speaking, I think it would be regrettable if we were to give Turkey the impression that we are going back on the commitments we have given and on the principles we ourselves laid down in Helsinki. That is why, in the same spirit, the European Union must fulfil the commitments it has made with regard to this country, which I think it imperative to meet, particularly in terms of financial aid. The French Presidency has made this one of its objectives and I believe we are making progress. This House has, of course, on several occasions been invited to give an opinion on this matter, be it the MEDA Programme or the financial regulations proposed by the Commission to ensure Euro-Turkish rapprochement and to support the customs union, but there are also the European Investment Bank projects, which are essential in order to support Turkey’s economic development and to continue the reconstruction work undertaken following the earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased, in this respect, with the conclusions the report presented by Mr Seppänen on the EIB special action programme in support of the consolidation and intensification of the EC-Turkey customs union. When it last held the presidency, in 1995, France spared no effort in order to conclude this customs union agreement, which has since been in force since 1 January 1996. It must, however, be acknowledged that the funding allocated to Turkey since then has not always reflected the level of commitments which the Union made at that time. Progress has been made, however, particularly in the course of the last year, and I am pleased to see the increase announced by the Commission in appropriations allocated to this country. It is indeed important that the financial resources made available to Turkey should match up to the objectives that have been set. For its part, the Presidency would like to see this special action programme of EIB loans adopted by the Council very soon, probably as early as the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers of Economic and Financial Affairs on 27 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that we are all awaiting with keen interest the proposal announced by the Commission for a single regulation intended to coordinate all sources of Community aid to Turkey, in line with the plans made in Helsinki. It is only natural to standardise the arrangements for pre-accession aid to that country with those applicable to the other candidates according to the Phare Programme model. Parliament will, of course, have the opportunity to deliver an opinion on this matter, when the time comes. As you know, however, this pre-accession aid will be more particularly intended to help Turkey achieve the objectives laid down in the future accession partnership agreement. This is a key instrument in the pre-accession strategy for this country, and its importance was rightly highlighted in the recent Commission report. This is a proposal which is going to be examined in detail by the competent Council bodies, so you will understand that I cannot, in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, afford to pre-judge the situation. Without prejudice to the debate due to start this week, I think I may safely say, however, that the Commission has presented a very constructive and very demanding proposal, both for the European Union and for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I am delighted to see that their proposal is in line with many of the very welcome recommendations made by Mr Morillon. I am thinking of the intensified work to achieve democratisation, particularly in the area of the separation of powers or of declaring an end to the state of emergency in a number of Turkish provinces. The Presidency’s preference is for this draft to be adopted very quickly, indeed, if possible, as early as 20 November, the date of the forthcoming General Affairs Council, and, as I have already mentioned, for it to comply with the very specific decisions adopted in Helsinki. It will then be up to Turkey to take its inspiration from this in order to work out its own national programme to integrate the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and in order to implement the reforms, all the reforms necessary, with the support of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Major prospects are opening up to us, and we know the task will be long and complex. Let us be demanding, let us be vigilant, but at the same time, let us remain consistent with the logic of our decision, making a bet on Turkey, having confidence in its determination for rapprochement with the European Union, and let us therefore assist Turkey to boost its ability to implement the necessary reforms which we quite legitimately expect of the country.</p>

<p class="contents">As you know, not only has the Commission recently submitted the progress report for the year 2000; it has also proposed an accession partnership for the very first time in the history of our relations. I am delighted to be able to report that the Turkish Government has since acknowledged this accession partnership as the basis for further cooperation, giving us good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve, i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform in a bid to achieve membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft resolution highlights our common objective of bringing Turkey closer to the European Union. We must constantly repeat in no uncertain terms that it is in our strategic European interest to anchor Turkey solidly and permanently in our community of values. We want Turkey to be a modern, open state in which democracy and human rights are respected, the rule of law applies and minorities are protected and respected. We can already see that the Helsinki process has set a series of interesting and important developments in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">In Turkey itself, the first signs of the incipient reform process, a process of fundamental and comprehensive political reform, are beginning to show. Relations between Greece and Turkey have improved considerably. Just a few days ago, the Greek and Turkish foreign secretaries confirmed that both countries wished to agree on and implement further confidence-building measures, both bilaterally and under the aegis of NATO. And finally, negotiations on Cyprus have been resumed under the aegis of the United Nations. So far, five rounds of talks have taken place. That in itself is a huge success.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission stands by what it has clearly stated in its progress report, i.e. that Turkey, like every other candidate country, must meet the Copenhagen criteria during the process of <span class="italic">rapprochement</span>. For the moment, we are focusing mainly on the political criteria, because accession negotiations are out of the question until all the political criteria have been met. I repeat: accession negotiations are out of the question until we are sure that the political conditions have been met; which is not the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns have been voiced on several occasions here in the House. I agree: we should be worried that there is too little respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, we should be worried about the constitutional role of the army and we are still extremely worried about the situation of the population of Kurdish origin and about the state of emergency in the four remaining provinces in the south-east.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I have said, the Helsinki process is already showing positive developments and positive results. The most important thing, as far as I am concerned, is that Helsinki triggered a debate in Turkey, a public debate on the conditions of Turkey's accession to the EU, a debate which is supporting and bolstering the forces of reform in Turkey. For example, the Human Rights Committee in the Turkish national assembly has reported on torture in Turkey and the Turkish government has passed a resolution to bring the Turkish constitution and the Turkish legal system into line with the values of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that everything which being announced and discussed in Turkey is actually being put into practice. I think that the accession partnership which we have tabled is the best way of supporting this process and of ensuring that the European Union is able to exert the necessary influence on the process itself. We have listed the short- and medium-term priorities which Turkey needs to implement under a national programme in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria and on which financial support will then be based.</p>
<p class="contents">The political section of our report describes the fundamental and comprehensive political reforms. They include constitutional guarantees of freedom of opinion, assembly and religion, the abolition of the death penalty, and end to torture, reconciling the role of the military with the rules of play of a democratic society, lifting the state of emergency in the south-east of the country and guaranteeing cultural rights for all Turks, irrespective of their national origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I have stressed time and again in my contacts with the Turkish Government that the European Union expects Turkey to give a firm undertaking that it will take action to implement these reform objectives. And I must say that I am convinced that the Turkish Government is firmly resolved to take a decisive approach to the reform projects needed. President Sezar clearly stated why Turkey had no alternative but to embark on this process of reform in his address to the Turkish Government last month and I fully endorse what the Turkish President said. Turkey must become a full democracy, not only because the European Union insists on it but because the Turkish people deserve it.</p>
<p class="contents">What all this means is that we still have a great deal of work to do. That also applies to meeting the economic criteria and the capacity to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Here too, I agree in the main with Mr Morillon's report.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission proposed a directive in July, setting out the legal basis for the accession partnership and creating a uniform financial framework. This text has been submitted for you to take a stand on it. I should like to take this opportunity of asking you to support this proposal. Without a legal basis, the accession partnership will not have what I for one am sure will be a positive political impact, because we will be unable to pass a resolution on it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling on Turkey, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, to engage in a process of comprehensive reform. But that means that we too must be prepared to support Turkey's process of reform, just as we are supporting all the other candidate countries with substantial funding. As a possible contribution to this, the Commission has proposed that the European Investment Bank grant Turkey a line of credit of EUR 450 million, to be used mainly to improve the competitiveness of the Turkish economy on the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Completion of the necessary political reforms will be one of the focal points – if not the focal point – of relations between the Union and Turkey. I am delighted that you will be exchanging views on this question with your Turkish counterparts in the joint parliamentary committee next week. I also welcome the proposals in this report on stepping up parliamentary cooperation and strengthening civil society. Thank you.</p>

Here we are talking about establishing a special programme to consolidate the Customs Union, extending the mandate of the European Investment Bank so that it can cover new loans to Turkey in the 2000-2004 period amounting to EUR 450 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The report was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgets. Given that this special programme of EUR 450 million, of which the European Union is guaranteeing 65%, specifies that at a provisioning rate of 9 % only EUR 26 million will have to be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund, there will only be a budgetary impact in the event of a default, because in that case the guarantee would have to be called in.</p>
<p class="contents">With these loans from the European Investment Bank we are supporting investment in Turkish industry and in its infrastructures in terms of transport, energy and telecommunications. All this is in order to increase Turkey’s competitiveness within the Customs Union and thus reduce the negative impact that the dismantling of trade barriers is having on the Turkish economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental issue regarding Turkey is not, therefore, considered in the Committee on Budgets, and this must be very clear. The fundamental issue of Turkey’s accession continues to be a political issue and it is the responsibility of other parliamentary committees. Customs Union and the loans from the European Investment Bank have been operating with Turkey for many years. The aim now is to give the boost that is needed towards future accession. I repeat that the only serious problems that we could have would occur if the macro-financial aid promised reached the maximum amount established, as in this hypothesis the residual reserve for guarantees would be reduced to practically zero for 2001 and 2002. Let us remember that it is in the interests of the European Union to fund nuclear safety projects in third countries in the framework of Euratom. A zero level of residual reserve could lead to definite problems in funding those investments.</p>
<p class="contents">The general situation that the report sets out is part of a situation of Parliament/Council negotiation for the 2001 budget, in which the European Parliament wishes to extend its rights to information and consultation in the case of external commitments by the Union that have a financial impact. This is the position that the Group of the Europe People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats advocates and that Parliament adopted at first reading. Let us hope that it leads to tripartite dialogue and conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A report on Turkey is no easy task because there are always so many contradictory developments. There have been positive developments, such as the new minister for Europe, such as the new special secretariat-general for European affairs attached to the prime minister's office, but there have also been regrettable shortcomings as far as Turkey's preparations for accession are concerned. Nothing has been done about abolishing the death penalty, and very little has been done to set minority and human rights on a solid legal basis, even if a few UN conventions have been signed.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not augur well that a person who offers no unconditional guarantee that more will be done about human rights has been elected as chairman of the human rights committee in parliament. The same goes for the Kurdish question. There have been a few vaguely positive signs here. Reports in the Kurdish language may be allowed on television and radio and a certain degree of recognition of the Kurdish culture could follow. On the other hand, a number of mayors have been arrested and the Hadep party have trouble in Kurdish areas in the south-east.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely these contradictions alone illustrate the struggle within Turkey itself between progressive forces and reactionary forces, which simply have no interest in moving towards Europe. And that is a pity. The Commissioner is quite right. We must and we should do everything we can to support and back the positive, progressive forces within Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like here, quite openly, to touch on the so-called Armenian question. At a meeting which I, unfortunately, was unable to attend, my group decided by a majority to support Amendment No 25. As far as the content is concerned, there is little to say against this motion. Unfortunately, however, a number of people are using the motions on Armenia and the massacre of the Armenians as a pretext to question, in a roundabout way, the very notion of Turkey's joining the European Union. I think that is wrong and I think it is dangerous. Nonetheless, I would urge Turkey to take this issue seriously, whatever the outcome of the vote. We all have to come to terms with our own history and with the actions of our antecedent countries and states openly and honestly. I think that Turkey should take a fresh approach and that it and Armenia should commission their historians to analyse what happened in order to uncover, explain, take a clear stand on and clearly admit what happened.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that would be the best way out of this tricky situation, because it is far easier to undertake this sort of analysis yourself than it is to impose it from outside. In this sense I should like to revert to what the Commissioner said. He said that it was in our strategic interest to anchor Turkey solidly and permanently in the European community of values – I think those were his words. That is what is at stake here and Turkey too should acknowledge it. Even if Parliament is critical and even if Parliament is perhaps more critical than the Council and the Commission can ever be, we trust that Turkey will choose this way forward and will become a member of the European Union just as soon as it has put its house in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey is clearly the place for a debate on the past as part of its general self-examination concerning fundamental rights. Such a self-appraisal will amount to a veritable cultural revolution. We should be satisfied that process is proven to have started.</p>
<p class="contents">The Morillon report and the accession to partnership commit the European Union to Turkey's candidature. It is now up to Turkey to show that it is committed to membership. The European Parliament will play its part in fostering relations with political parties, the NGOs and the press, as well as developing its tricky and sometimes fraught relationship with the Grand National Assembly. European Liberals are certainly prepared to play their part in bringing closer the prospect of Turkish membership and the spreading of prosperity, stability and security to all European peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, you have not, and therefore we have not, managed to solve all the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, it is clear that the strategy of accepting Turkey’s candidature was the right one. It was the correct strategy, as the Commissioner commented, because the debate which has taken place in Turkey today in order for it to become a member of the European Union is tantamount to a debate in favour of radical reform of the political situation in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at an important historic phase for Turkey, which has made the transition from the phase of debate to the phase of practical action, i.e. the implementation of reforms of the Constitution and the law, such as, for instance, an amnesty for prisoners of conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the phase which Turkey is now facing. We must be perfectly clear, we cannot move on to any further stages without Turkey making the transition from debate to practical action. That is exactly what the Morillon report states.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, there is the Cyprus situation. On this subject we have to tell Turkey that its refusal to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg cannot be tolerated. There have been a number of rulings against Turkey. Turkey must without further ado fall in line with the rulings of the European Court of Justice as a token of acceptance of international relations as defined by us, and not just by them.</p>
<p class="contents">We now come to the basic problem. A variety of strategies are considered within the European Parliament and within the Member States. Some are in favour of the candidature and the accession of Turkey, and want this candidature to involve a radical reform of Turkish society. Then there are those that are opposed to the country’s accession, who take advantage of the essential debate on Turkish policy and reforms to create a great division between Turkey and Europe. Turkish society obviously perceives this contradictory attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the final problem to be resolved, the Armenian genocide, is of such importance. There is no one here, least of all myself, who would deny the fact that genocide was perpetrated against the Armenians during the last period of the Ottoman Empire. It is a clear fact, just as it is clear that Turkey, like any civilised society, should get used to the idea of facing up to its past, however terrible it may have been. This is one of the indispensable conditions in terms of ideology and civilisation needed for any country to join Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another matter, and if we have to vote on it today, the majority of my Group will vote in favour of this resolution. I am not certain, personally, that this is a useful move, because I wish to take the debate to Turkey. In other words, I propose that the European Parliament should itself hold a debate on the Armenian genocide, the majority will follow on and we shall continue the debate in Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Morillon, in my view, your report is an exceptionally realistic and responsible report. We have indeed seen a number of interesting symbolic acts on the part of the Turkish Government since the Helsinki Council resolution several months ago. However, nothing has been done to change the horrendous situation in Turkish jails, discrimination against the Kurds or Turkey's policy on Cyprus. The constitutional role of the Turkish military, which is irreconcilable with the rule of law and democratic mores, has become, without doubt, one of the keys to future relations between the EU and Turkey and will only be resolved if the military relinquishes its power. There may well be differences of opinion on the Morillon report within my group, but one thing is clear – and I imagine this is true of the other groups – and that is that we have no intention whatsoever of mitigating our criticism on these issues. Compromise is possible almost everywhere, except here.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important and tangible result so far is that a debate has begun and a certain degree of political differentiation has started to emerge in Turkey. We must acknowledge and actively support this. Nonetheless, what we are looking for here is not just compliance with the Copenhagen criteria but compulsory democratic standards. Turkey's membership on this basis, rather than for the geo-strategic reasons put forward by the USA or NATO, would enrich the European Union and represent a significant step towards a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not overlooked the problems which this might cause, such as the fact that, geographically, the EU would then stretch well beyond Europe into what are highly unstable regions from the point of view of security policy. The fact that the strategic aspects of the prospects of European integration have been addressed neither by the governments nor, Commissioner, by the Commission, and have not been discussed with Parliament in connection either with Turkey's candidate status or with current enlargement to the east is, in my view, unacceptable given the implications. In my experience – the experience, I may add, of a life which knows just as much about radical social change as the refusal to recognise the need for it in time –, there is no substitute for critical candour. Anything else would simply play into the hands of those in the EU and in Turkey who oppose this membership. And that is where, Commissioner Verheugen, I start to lose the plot in your progress report. When you visited Turkey in March, you at least referred to the Kurdish problem by name, as you did here today. Your report makes no mention of this problem per se. I think that is a tragic step backwards in comparison with the old Commission's 1999 report. Truth is where the concept corresponds with its reality. At least that is what Mr Hegel believed. I have yet to see any real progress in Turkey, but I do believe it is possible. But, in my book, the Commission report is a real step backwards.</p>

I fully agree with this statement, but I would say that the decision by the Helsinki European Council to grant Turkey applicant country status was not preceded by the essential debate – both public and parliamentary – that General Morillon’s explanatory statement also calls for.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s candidature has always divided European opinion and I find it surprising that there is still an ongoing debate on the reasons for changing the traditional position of reserve with which this candidature has always been viewed. There is, of course, the geographical problem. Have we forgotten that only a small part of Turkish territory falls within the European continent? What new doctrine on the European area allows us to frame this new concept of external borders that would result from including Turkey in the European Union? Europe’s borders are now peaceful but, if Turkey does one day join the European Union, Europe will have a new border; not just an extra-European border, but a border of war and conflict. One only needs to think of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Armenia and Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, how can we resolve the conflict with the common democratic model that Europeans accept and wish to see, which results from the countless restrictions we see in Turkey on people exercising their fundamental rights, of which the maintenance of the death penalty is merely the worst example? And what of the Kurdish question, which arises from the fact that the Turkish State does not respect the basic rights of cultural identity of the millions of Kurds that live there?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I do not feel that questions have been asked concerning the size of the actual population represented by Turkey’s candidacy and the difficulties that this will cause, not only in terms of the Union’s geography but especially in terms of the already delicate balance between large, medium-sized and small Member States. I shall conclude as I began: the idea and purpose of my speech have been to draw attention to the fact that changes on this scale should not take place without a democratic, ongoing debate, otherwise the deficit in citizenship and participation that many Europeans feel with regard to the model of European construction will continue to grow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This motion for a resolution contains anything and everything, with, in the first place, a great many illusions and a great many ritualistic recitals, which are, fortunately, immediately overtaken by reality, and this Turkish reality obviously does not match European illusions or dreams. The suggestion that the Europeans are going to bring about, I quote, “a radical change in habits and outlook” in the Turks is both extremely naive and extremely self-important. What arrogance on the part of the European Union to seek to foist its own values, institutional principles and political culture on the Turkish nation! The twentieth century has, however, proved the extent to which forms of constructivism and state control, cut off from reality, and ideologies of all sort could lead to disaster. Let us therefore leave the Turkish nation their right to self-determination, their right to decide their own future, their right to be different, and their right to retain values of civilisation that are patently not our own.</p>
<p class="contents">So the only real preamble which we should all be bound by is a recital taking into consideration the obvious facts of the situation. Turkey is not a European country, its culture is not European, and its values are not European. Turkey must not, therefore, join the European Union. That is no obstacle, moreover, to Europe’s developing economic, diplomatic, political and peaceful relations with a free and independent Turkey. Such a clear stance would, among other things, at least have the merit of no longer blowing hot and cold with regard to Turkish Governments, no longer telling them, “yes but later”, “yes but on certain conditions”, “yes but this or that”. Europe’s contradictions and prevarications only lead to incomprehension and humiliation. We cannot play about with the dignity of nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall therefore vote against this report, just as we have voted against all the reports seeking to make Turkey a member of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey’s former Foreign Minister, Mümtaz Soysal, recently put this pressing question. It is an extremely opportune question, as it happens, because just how important is it to Ankara that Turkey accedes to the European Union? It is common knowledge that to do so, Turkey must first fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria. As Mr Morillon rightly states in his well-balanced report, there is no sign whatsoever of this happening yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with your permission I would like to briefly take up three fundamental points in Mr Morillon’s report: the political influence exerted by the Turkish army, the Kurdish question and the aspect referred to earlier of ‘tolerance for other religions and cultures’.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the political influence exerted by the Turkish army – and it is unremitting to this day! – the very primacy of civilian politics is at stake, no less. Why are Turkey’s politicians failing to deliver the goods on this crucial issue of power? Or perhaps they are only too willing to hide behind the military apparatus when it comes to European demands for reform?</p>
<p class="contents">If Turkey were to allow the Kurds, of which there are some 12 million, full cultural autonomy, this could largely defuse the thorny Kurdish issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet how hard it is to win the Turkish political establishment over to this solution, from which both parties stand to benefit. Take, for example, the implacable attitude of the chairman of the parliamentary committee for Foreign Affairs, Kamran Inan. This mentor for Turkish foreign policy categorically rules out any form of concession over Cyprus or the Kurds. According to Inan, in the final analysis, uncertain membership of the European Union is no compensation for the sacrifice of national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the ultranationalist MHP party was in deadly earnest when it underlined ‘the superiority of the Turkish race’ at its party conference ten days ago. And remember, according to the latest opinion polls the MHP is the most popular political movement in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Morillon makes the point in recital D that the successors to the legendary Atatürk should not perceive the Union as an 'exclusive Christian club' but as a community of shared values which embrace, in particular, ‘tolerance for other religions and cultures’</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that by and large, the position of the Christian minority in Turkey is worse than that of Muslim groups in Europe. It is certainly a good deal easier to build a mosque in Europe than it is to build a church in Turkey; which is another point the Commission and Parliament should give serious thought to in their contacts with the Turkish authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems are so serious as to preclude Turkey's accession in the foreseeable future. I should like to table three reservations: Turkey has not even started to resolve the problem of the minorities living there. Secondly, there is no end in sight to the dispute with Greece over the island of Cyprus, which still smoulders on. And thirdly, Turkey's criminal justice system, based as it still is on the death penalty and police torture, is unworthy of a western democracy. Horrific pictures of serious maltreatment of detainees by the police were recently broadcast on German television.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, Turkey still has a long and difficult way to go and it obviously needs our help along the way. We aim to help Turkey become a free democratic country in which the rule of law prevails. The Council should consider whether granting Turkey candidate status has done more harm than good here. It will have done more harm if Turkey's expectations of accession have been raised and cannot be met because of the political situation. The Islamic forces will certainly know how to make political capital out of any such disappointment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
