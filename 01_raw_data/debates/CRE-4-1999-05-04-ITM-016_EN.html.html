That has only happened to a very small extent. But it is at any rate welcome that the Council has reduced the original list of nine categories of foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses to five specific directives. The list should have been just four, because in its opinion at first reading, Parliament quite rightly found that there were no grounds for drawing up a specific directive on foods for sportsmen. For us to be able to define a food as intended for a particular nutritional use, it should fulfil particular nutritional needs for certain categories of persons who cannot eat ordinary food, either because there is something wrong with their digestion or metabolism, or because in a particular physiological condition they can derive particular benefit from the controlled intake of certain substances in their food. Infants and young children are one category, but sportsmen hardly fit into this definition. And there is a fear that ordinary foods with special characteristics which are particularly suitable for sportsmen, such as pasta and various drinks, will be brought into the specific directive. This would create confusion for consumers and directly work against the simplification of rules which the directive is intended to encourage. The interests of industry appear to have weighed more heavily than those of consumers when the Council insisted on this entirely superfluous directive. The opposite should of course have been the case, so that consideration for consumers was the decisive factor.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I am pleased that the Council has put on hold the question of a specific directive on foods for diabetics. My colleagues in Parliament wanted this directive, but I think that in this case we should listen to the diabetics" organisations, which have expressed the unanimous opinion that the marketing of and easy access to diabetic products creates a false demand among diabetics. In fact, diabetic products have no place in the modern treatment of diabetes. They contain a high level of harmful fats, have inadequate labelling and typically cost up to 400 % more than ordinary foods, which is a completely unnecessary and unreasonable burden to put on diabetics. What is needed is sensible information and a proper and, most importantly, individually worked‐out diet. The result of the Council's compromise, which is to obtain an opinion from the Scientific Committee for Food, will hopefully be that no directive is drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">And so to the specific directive on baby foods, which is the reason why the adoption of the framework directive is taking so long. I would first and foremost like to congratulate Mrs Breyer for proposing and insisting on the amendment requiring baby food products to be pesticide‐free in order to be covered by the directive. I must admit that at the second reading of the framework directive, I agreed with the Council that the framework directive was not the right place for the specific directive's provisions on pesticide levels in baby food, although I of course agreed entirely with Mrs Breyer that baby food should be pesticide‐free. Nonetheless, thanks to Mrs Breyer's amendment, Parliament has succeeded in putting pressure on both the Commission and the Food Committee. The long conciliation procedure we have been through has had a decisive influence on the fact that the maximum level for pesticides in baby food has been set at 0.01 mg/kg, which means in practice pesticide‐free baby food, because it is not possible to measure any lower levels. In practice, if the provisions of the directive are to be met, it will only be possible to use organic products in baby food. Hopefully, the next step will be for the EU therefore also to improve the opportunities for organic farmers to produce the necessary products in a competitive way, which is something Agenda 2000 unfortunately does not do.</p>
<p class="contents">The handling of some of the specific directives which have already been issued has been rather problematic. The directive on baby food is a welcome exception. It should lead us in Parliament to realise that directives of a technical nature may also have a political content which cannot be left to a committee of experts. I hope that on Thursday, Parliament will adopt the Aglietta report on the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, so that the baby food success story can be followed by many others. In any event, adopting this directive in accordance with the Conciliation Committee's joint text will be a good start.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liese </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remain a great many important issues to be discussed this week in Parliament: the nomination of the new Commission President, Mr Prodi, Agenda 2000 and many more besides. The framework directive on dietetic foods does not appear to be the most important issue here, as is evident, moreover, by the number of Members present. However, I believe that there are some important points which need to be addressed here. Mrs Sandbæk has already addressed the particularly contentious issue of pesticides in baby foods; this issue concerns the health of babies and small children. I believe that the public would not understand it if Europe agreed to reduce this issue to its lowest common denominator; what is important here is the precautionary principle. As Members of Parliament, we have always insisted on this precautionary principle and stated that pesticides have no business being in baby foods, and we have also made this clear by means of an amendment. I am very satisfied with the outcome of the conciliation procedure – as is my group – since this principle was adopted in the course of the conciliation procedure, obviously not as part of the conciliation procedure, but politically as part of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate clearly that as Members of Parliament we have relied on scientific opinion whatever the issue, such as the opinions expressed by ESPEGAM, for example, which has clearly stated that as long as there is no ADI for infants, an extremely strict value of virtually zero needs to be set. I should like to thank the Commission which – I want to get this right – has resigned, but which is still in office. It has not been an easy time. I think that, exceptionally, Mr Bangemann can also be singled out on this issue for having supported the campaign for consumer protection. I regret the fact that he initially experienced so much resistance within the Commission, particularly from Mrs Bonino, who should in fact have supported consumer protection. However, a happy outcome is worth waiting for. We have obtained a good result, and we shall be able to give our assent tomorrow.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Breyer </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span><span class="italic"> – (DE) </span>Mr President, we shall also be giving our assent tomorrow. I was very pleased that Mrs Sandbæk also reiterated that it was the amendment tabled by the Greens which provided that baby foods should in future be pesticide‐free. I think that this is a great victory for consumer protection, and it contributes in a significant way to making agricultural policy more environmentally friendly. We have proved with this decision that we can succeed in making the highest standards, namely the no‐trace limit value already in force in Germany – a standard for the whole of the EU. We can now only hope that the manufacturers of baby foods in the EU make the necessary adjustments quickly, since it is clear that baby foods must be free of all poisonous substances. Harmonisation in this area really cannot be reduced to the lowest common denominator; instead, we must demonstrate the highest degree of precaution and duty of care towards the youngest members of our society.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we hope that this will now also be the starting point for an initiative against the ADI concept for all foodstuffs, particularly those for school children and young people, since it in fact refers to the recommended intake of pesticides for an adult. It is not only babies who absorb on average much more per kilo of body weight, but also school children and young people. I now think that we must start to reconsider the whole ADI concept, and we must build on this success in an attempt to extend it in future to school children and young people, since it has been proven that even the minutest quantities of pesticide can result in serious illness, particularly among children.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (DE) </span>Mr President, I should firstly also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur. We had been instructed by the European Council to reduce the number of acts governing dietetic foods. We have not managed to do this now because we have two more, but at least we have achieved a certain degree of clarification. I am being quite frank with you when I say – and you already know this from previous debates – that I would have preferred it if we could at least have done without the directive on foods for sportsmen; this is more likely to result in misinformation in any case, especially as it will be very difficult to obtain clear provisions for the different types of sport because the foodstuffs that can be recommended or are important for a certain type of sport vary considerably from sport to sport. But I do not believe that it would be right to reject the outcome of conciliation on this issue or on account of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of pesticide residues in baby foods, the Commission has taken a very clear position which corresponds exactly to the one we eventually adopted on this. The only difference was whether this should be laid down in the specific directive or the framework directive. Nonetheless, we agreed on the general and practical issues. Admittedly, there was discussion within the Commission, but such discussions take place often anyway. After all, it is also a fact that not all Commissioners can be of the same opinion from the start. However, we managed to agree that special consideration of the precautionary principle is appropriate for babies and toddlers. That is to say, the very low level of pesticide residues will apply – this has been proposed by us, and will be adopted – even though the results of scientific research are not available yet in all cases or for all pesticides. We have therefore abandoned our usual position on this point, although we will still keep to it in the future, unless really strong grounds exist for proceeding only on the basis of the precautionary principle without scientific findings. This means that we will still aim to base our legislative measures on scientific findings. I still consider this to be the correct approach; otherwise, we would be in a state of confusion which would not be helpful to consumers either, since it results in arbitrary action which is also not the way to help consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to reiterate – this holds true for the present Commission and I hope it will also hold true for the next one – that if we cease to base our decisions on the results of scientific research, then we will open the floodgates to all types of decisions being taken, and we will basically no longer be able to explain why a decision has been taken. The precautionary principle, whereby the results of scientific research can be ignored, or results can be achieved without them, is clearly an exception to the rule in this case. The Commission has also supported this, but we cannot make it the norm. I would point this out to Mrs Breyer. She is starting now with school children. Then come those reaching the age of puberty, for whom it is particularly important not to be exposed to any danger whatsoever. Then come those in their twenties who suffer from not being able to go to discos any more, and then those up to the age of forty. Then, for those aged over forty, the dilemma is the same as for babies. They have to be protected against everything. Mrs Breyer, the Commission will not support you on this.</p>
