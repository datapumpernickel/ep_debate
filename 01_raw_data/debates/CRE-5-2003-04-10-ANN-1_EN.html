<p>(EL) On 13 February 2003 the Council received the Commission proposal for Council Regulation referred to by the honourable Member and is in the process of examining it. It aims to take a decision on it before 14 May in line with the timetable set out by the regulatory procedure.</p>
<p>Sectoral graduation is a feature of the European Union's Scheme of Generalised Tariff Preferences. Such graduation is meant to target preferences on those countries other than those which turn out to be able to face international competition without preferential market access. In 2001 the Council decided that as a matter of principle it should also apply to the special arrangements to combat drug production and trafficking, as it already applied to the GSP in general.</p>
<p>The EU remains committed to the commitments made on a possible future agreement, including a Free Trade Agreement, made at the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit.</p>

<p>(EL) At its meeting in Brussels on 20/21 March, the European Council adopted conclusions calling on all countries of the region to refrain from actions that could lead to further instability in the context of the Iraq war, and which were endorsed by Turkey together with all other acceding and candidate States. By this, the European Council made it clear that the EU expects Turkey to apply restraint. At the same time the European Council expressed readiness to assist those countries that are faced with problems and risks as a result of the conflict, including possible refugee flows.</p>
<p>Turkey has shown awareness of the risks carried by a dispatch of troops, justified according to Ankara, for the purposes of safeguarding its interests inter alia as regards massive flow of refugees; it appears now that Turkey, following recent consultations with the United States in particular, is committed to refrain from such a move. Until these days as a matter of fact no discernible refugee movement has been recorded.</p>
<p>The EU follows very attentively the situation and is staying in close contact with the Turkish authorities on this. The EU trusts in Turkey to address its concerns by other ways than military intervention.

<p>(EL) In February, the European Council unambiguously expressed its concern about the situation in Iraq and about weapons of mass destruction. It urged the Iraqi authorities to cooperate fully and actively with the UN. The Council regrets that, in the end, it was not possible to resolve the situation peacefully.</p>
<p>The Union’s position on the military conflict in Iraq is clearly set out in the European Council Statement on 20 March. On that occasion, the Union decided to intensify work for a comprehensive, coherent and effective multilateral policy of the international community to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As to the Iraqi conflict, the European Council hoped that it would end with the minimum loss of human life and suffering. The honourable Member is certainly well aware that the Council has not taken a position on the question of the legality of the war with Iraq.</p>
<p>The immediate priority must be the welfare of all the Iraqi people. That is why the Council has supported that the UN’s ‘Oil for Food Programme’ be resumed so that humanitarian and medical assistance can continue to be met through that programme. It welcomed very much that the Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution to that end on 28 March. About 60 % of the Iraqi population depend on the ‘Oil-for-Food’ programme, so it is important that it is not interrupted for a long time.</p>
<p>On the UN’s role in general, the Council remains firmly of the view that the UN must play a central role during and after the conflict, and that the UN system has a unique capacity in coordinating assistance in post-conflict States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0207"></a>

<p>(EN) According to the Seville European Council conclusions and following the Road Map established by the Council, the Commission, the Council and the Member States have carried or are carrying out the actions provided for.</p>
<p>As regards the execution of the initiatives conferred upon the Commission, the Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that either they have been achieved or they are in progress. They will be completed according to the timing provided for by the road map established by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, following the Council's Plan of 28 February to combat illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings in the Union and the Council's Plan of 13 June 2002 for the management of the external borders of the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p>For example, the review of the list of third countries, whose nationals require visa or are exempt from that requirement has been carried out through the amending Council Regulation EC n°453/2003, adopted by the Council 6 March 2003<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And the feasibility study on a common identification system for visa data is almost finalised and the report will be ready soon.</p>
<p>As regards the feasibility of establishing a European Corps of Border Guards, this is a very sensitive, political issue.</p>
<p>The Commission has envisaged the possible creation of such a body as the final target of a dynamic process aimed at developing in stages an integrated management of the external borders.</p>
<p>The Council's Plan, adopted on 13 June 2002, retained this approach and structured it in providing a series of measures and actions to be performed with a tight calendar.</p>
<p>The Council has placed ‘a possible decision on the setting up of a European Corps of Border Guards, composed of joint teams’ of Member States guards and with the sole function of supporting the national services’ at the end of a long process.</p>
<p>The development of joint operations and projects carried out by the Member States would constitute indispensable progress towards the integrated management.</p>
<p>Only after these experiences and an in-depth evaluation of their impact, such an important step might be considered.</p>
<p>The Commission shares this point of view. The Commission is confident of the positive impact of the numerous common activities, such as pilot projects and joint operations, which the Member States are carrying out in order to develop common practices at the external borders and to adopt a common model for the risk analysis and a core curriculum for the border guards training.</p>
<p>The European Council of Thessaloniki of June 2003 will examine various reports in the field of migration and the management of external borders and will provide the Commission with its appreciation of these experiences.</p>
<p>The Commission is sure that its efforts to build up a common integrated policy for the management of the external borders will receive the necessary political support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) First of all, it should be pointed out that the Commission does not have the right of initiative for the Convention, as it does for Community legislation. It takes part in the debate through two members of the Convention, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino, and their two alternates. This low numerical representation should be compared to that of Parliament, which has 16 members in the Convention. It is, however, true that both the Commission and the European Parliament have two representatives in the Praesidium of the Convention (which has 12 members) which produces the initial drafts of articles.</p>
<p>Regarding the subject with which the honourable Member is concerned, the Commission has already made its view known in the answer to written question no. <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2003-0159_EN.html">E-0159/03</a>. The Commission in no way considers the issue of discrimination to be a secondary one.</p>
<p>The Commission:</p>
<p>- supports the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution, which will make the Charter legally binding so that it can be directly invoked by citizens. Article 21 of the Charter forbids any type of discrimination, expressly citing discrimination on grounds of language or membership of a minority;</p>
<p>- also supports the inclusion of an additional provision generally forbidding discrimination, in addition to discrimination on grounds of nationality. Including this type of provision in the Constitution is necessary in order to create a legal basis to enable the Union to combat discrimination, insofar as it has been recognised that even if the Charter is incorporated into the Constitution that does not create new powers for the Union.</p>
<p>These opinions have been expressed both within the Praesidium and at the plenary sessions on the first articles of the Constitution on 27 February by Mr Barnier. At that plenary session, Mr Barnier supported the full incorporation of the Charter into the Constitution, covering all types of discrimination. He also suggested that the Constitution should contain a specific provision banning all types of discrimination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0202"></a>

<p>(EN) The press statement quoted by the honourable Member refers to the debate on the Commission proposal for a Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>When the Parliament discussed Ms Cusi´s report on this proposal<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on 11 February 2003, the Commission made it clear that it does not intend to decide by directive the numbers of immigrants that Union economies and societies are prepared to absorb. The proposed directive leaves that decision with the Member States; only they, together with their civil societies and local authorities know how much their societies are capable of integrating.</p>
<p>Article 26 of this proposal explicitly acknowledges this fact and provides an option for Member States to adopt horizontal measures (e.g. national ceilings, temporary suspension of issuance of residence permits) in order to limit the admission of third country workers, if Member States consider this necessary, taking into account the overall capacity to receive and to integrate third country nationals on their territory or in specific regions thereof.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that immigration for the purpose of exercising employed or self-employed economic activities is a cornerstone of immigration policy. This is presently enshrined in Article 63 of the EC Treaty, and is also reflected in the draft Treaty text under discussion in the Convention, which would provide for the adoption of measures on the conditions of entry and stay of third country nationals.</p>
<p>The two other Directives, to which the honourable Member refers, deal with asylum policy, not with economic migration:</p>
<p>- Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers<a href="#defann_12_3" name="refann_12_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> lays down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in Member States. Regarding admission to work, its Article 11 provides that ‘Member States shall determine a period of time, starting from the date on which an application for asylum was lodged, during which an applicant shall not have access to the labour market. If a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application for asylum and this delay cannot be attributed to the applicant, Member States shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant. Access to the labour market shall not be withdrawn during appeals procedures, where an appeal against a negative decision in a regular procedure has suspensive effect, until such time as a negative decision on the appeal is notified. For reasons of labour market policies, Member States may give priority to Union citizens and nationals of States parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and also to legally resident third-country nationals.’</p>
<p>- Directive 2001/55 of 20 July 2001 on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof<a href="#defann_12_4" name="refann_12_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> establishes minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who are unable to return to their country of origin. Regarding admission to work, its Article 12 provides that ‘The Member States shall authorise, for a period not exceeding that of temporary protection, persons enjoying temporary protection to engage in employed or self-employed activities, subject to rules applicable to the profession, as well as in activities such as educational opportunities for adults, vocational training and practical workplace experience. For reasons of labour market policies, Member States may give priority to Union citizens and citizens of States bound by the Agreement on the European Economic Area and also to legally resident third-country nationals who receive unemployment benefit. The general law in force in the Member States applicable to remuneration, access to social security systems relating to employed or self-employed activities and other conditions of employment shall apply.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Directive 2001/29/EC<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> tries to strike a balance between, on the one hand, watertight protection of copyright and, on the other, free development of high-technology equipment, even if that may be used improperly in order, for example, to make illicit copies of works protected by copyright.

It is principally, but not exclusively, the opportunity provided by those exceptions which distributors of content, such as record companies and software firms, seize in order to (a) stop supporting authors financially and promoting them and (b) keep the price of CDs, inter alia, at an especially high level.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of this problem, and can it indicate what measures it is thinking of taking in order, on the one hand, to protect the rights of authors and their legal representatives and, on the other, to defend honest consumers against having to pay excessive prices for, inter alia, original music and software packages?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Article 5(2)b of Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to provide for exceptions or limitations to the exclusive right to reproduction established in Article 2 of the Directive and granted to authors for their work and performers, record producers and film producers for the other items protected. The exception established in Article 5(2)b allows private copying, for which the legal provisions are not harmonised at Community level. This is permitted on the condition that the rightholders receive ‘fair compensation’. It is the job of the Member States to ensure that the fair compensation is effectively distributed to the different rightholders. The form, arrangements and level for that fair compensation are given in Recital 35 of the Directive, which points out the quite broad degree of evaluation reserved for the Member States in order to determine it according to ‘the particular circumstances of each case’. However, the system of exceptions must comply with the three-stage test established in Article 5(5) of the Directive: the exception must apply to certain special cases, must not conflict with normal exploitation of the work or other protected items and must not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder. The Member States are currently transposing this Directive and the Commission is actively ensuring that this complies fully with the text of the Directive. The Commission also wishes to point out that the compensation should not be paid to one of the rightholders, such as the record producers, it should be paid to the others (the authors for example).</p>
<p>The price of pre-recorded audio and video products, which does not include the charge for private copying, is freely determined by the market. The Commission’s policies can only have an indirect impact on those prices, in particular by applying competition or internal market regulations. Also, and in general, the price of media which enable private copying does not essentially depend on the charge for private copying.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The recent prolonged intense rainfall in the Cyclades islands resulted not only in damage to infrastructure and property but also the erosion of dry-stone walls, a particular manual wall-building technique using stones, which conserve what little soil there is to be found on the craggy island terrain, supporting traditional agriculture and enhancing the ecological and aesthetic qualities of the landscape by protecting the soil from erosion and decomposition.</p>
<p>Given that dry-stone walling contributes to the environmental balance and the beauty of the Cyclades landscape and in view of the significant decline of traditional agriculture, which was based on this system of terracing, with all the implications for tourism and the economic survival of the local community, will the Commission take initiatives to protect dry-stone walling in order to maintain the ecological balance of the islands and the beauty of the Cyclades and to avert an irreparable environmental disaster?

<p>(FR) Sub-measure 3.12 of the rural development plan for 2000-2006 for Greece has a chapter on ‘the maintenance and reconstruction of terraces of sloping land’.

The Commission does not, therefore, envisage taking further initiatives to protect dry-stone walls in the Cyclades.</p>
<p>With regard to the other regions in the European Union (Spain, France and Italy) facing similar problems, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>In Spain, as part of the horizontal programme for accompanying measures, there is an agri-environmental measure to protect the countryside on maintaining elements of particular value to the countryside, more specifically concerning the maintenance and conservation of traditional walls and fences;</p>
<p>For France, there are no specific provisions on this subject. However, there is funding in place for this type of problem. Agri-environmental measures have been planned for many years in certain regions of the South of France to restore and maintain this type of heritage;</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission proposal addresses the acknowledged need for urgent reinforcement of the current rules for the identification and registration of sheep and goats, in particular in view of the experience acquired from the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) crisis.</p>
<p>In its Resolution of December 2002 on measures to control foot and mouth disease, the Parliament stated that the Commission should as quickly as possible submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats.</p>
<p>Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases.</p>
<p>Individual identification is also a key element in the framework of the programmes for eradication of brucellosis of sheep and goats, which are co-financed by the Community. These programmes cover 1/3 of the sheep and goat population above 12 months of age in the Community.</p>
<p>With regard to electronic identification, the Commission launched a large scale pilot project – the IDEA Project – in1998. The final report of this project, which included sheep and goats as well as bovine animals, was completed in 2002.</p>
<p>The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied. However, the implementing measures required for the proper introduction of the system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be fully developed.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes individual identification by means of two eartags - to ensure that the identity is retained where one eartag is lost - with possible authorisation of the use of an electronic identifier replacing the second eartag.</p>
<p>The reinforced system of identification and registration is proposed to enter into force on 1 July 2003, from which date all animals born on the holding or intended for intra-Community trade would be individually identified.</p>
<p>The proposal foresees the introduction of compulsory electronic identification by 1 July 2006 – taking into account the practical experience gained with regard to implementation.</p>
<p>To take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States the proposal includes options, which Member States may decide to apply under certain circumstances. The options decided upon will influence the likely costs of the farmers to introduce the new system.</p>
<p>The introduction of the reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease allowing the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of disease. Furthermore the benefits of accurate tracing of animals will be achieved in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities. But these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0150"></a>

<p>(FR) Freedom of establishment is a fundamental freedom that every Community national enjoys. That freedom is contained in and protected by Article 43 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits all measures restricting the freedom of establishment.</p>
<p>However, national measures that could hinder the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty or make them less attractive can be compatible with the Treaty if they fulfil four conditions: that they are applied in a non-discriminatory manner, that they are justified by pressing reasons of general interest, that they are appropriate for achieving their objective and that they do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve it.</p>

<p>The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) initiative has made very good progress. During the plenary of 27 March, the Parliament adopted, with unanimity 35 compromise amendments resulting from the agreement reached between the three institutions with a view to avoid a second reading. The ‘common structure’ of the EDCTP programme, set out as a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), will be the executive structure and manage the programme through its secretariat. The EDCTP-EEIG comprises two main components: the ‘EEIG Assembly’ (composed of national representatives nominated by their governments) and the ‘EEIG Secretariat’ providing administrative support for the work of the Partnership Board and the EEIG Assembly. The nominated members of the EEIG Assembly elected The Hague (NL) as the future host site of the EDCTP European Office on 4 March. It is expected that preliminary identification of tests sites in Africa could start in July/August 2003 and that the first clinical trials in Africa could take place by the end of 2003. Participating Member States have agreed to coordinate and implement jointly activities to the EDCTP Programme foreseen for a period of five years. The overall value of their national participation is estimated at € 200 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0158"></a>

<p>There has been some estimations made by the main humanitarian organisation before the conflict in their contingency plans. United Nations High Committee for Refugees (UNHCR) has planned for up to 600.000 refugees and/or asylum seekers stranded at border areas. UNHCR and International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) are today ready to provide emergency relief to more than 550.000 people within Iraq at the border and/or in Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey.</p>
<p>To date, refugee movements have been very limited, and no considerable movements of civilian populations have been registered towards Iraq's international borders. The situation is now the following:</p>
<p>- About 22.000 people moved towards Iran but finally they remained in Iraq.</p>
<p>- About 300.000 Internal Displaced People moved to Iraqi Kurdistan, with 90% hosted in families and only 5% receiving humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>- 1048 Third Nationals were in transit through Jordan, with only 190 still hosted in the camp.</p>
<p>- According to UNHCR report, less than 30 Iraqi refugees arrived to Syria (as of 28 March 2003).</p>
<p>Situation can change following the future developments of the conflict; however the Commission can not make reliable estimations at this stage.</p>
<p>If need will be, as announced by the Member of the Commission in charge of Development and Humanitarian aid on 20 March 2003, European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) stands ready to adopt a primary emergency decision worth € 3 million to provide UNHCR and ICRC with the financing of pre-positioned non-food emergency relief items for up to 120.000 refugees and/or asylum seekers stranded at border areas within Iraq.</p>
<p>As for migration, there are not particular indications about possible flows of refugees toward other countries, included Member States.

<p>(EN) The Vienna Convention on traffic signs and the protocol on road markings are the international guidelines for harmonisation in this domain. Their correct application should guarantee a good level of harmonisation. As far as directional signing is concerned, the European ‘Rightway’ project, supported by the Commission, concluded that safety benefits of harmonising colours of directional signs on motorways are minor, while the risks involved in a transition towards harmonised colours could easily outweigh these benefits. The Commission is also aware that obtrusion of the visibility as well as degradation and damage often pose the more serious safety problems. In terms of new roads, road safety audits allow to identify problems of inconsistent design features (alignment, signing, speed limits, lane widths etc.) before they are cast in concrete.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Commission has taken the following actions:</p>
<p>- At the end of 2002 a proposal for a directive on tunnel safety was submitted to Parliament and Council, which, amongst others, aims to harmonise tunnel related signs;</p>
<p>- The project Rightway identified existing differences in the application of the designs and colours of signs as set out in the Vienna Convention as well as of directional signs on motorways. Also, a harmonised system for indicating destinations was developed. Results have been widely made available;</p>

<p>(EN) The refugee issue is at the core of the conflict in the Middle East. It is the Union's position that ‘a just, viable and agreed solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees’ should be found (Declaration by the European Union on the Middle East, Seville European Council, 21-22 June 2002).</p>
<p>The continuing support of the Community for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is a key element in the Community's strategy of contributing actively to reducing tension and providing a minimum of stability in the Middle East, which would allow the parties to pursue their quest for peace. It also contributes to facilitating access to basic social services, reduction of poverty and an improvement of the refugees' living standard.</p>
<p>Community support under the current four-year Community-UNRWA funding convention is a contribution towards the financing of UNRWA's regular programmes for around 3.9 million Palestine refugees in five fields of operation: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The regular programmes financed under the General Fund include UNRWA's education programme, health programme, and relief and social services programme.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting UNRWA's General Fund the Commission provides food aid at the rate of € 15 million per year. From time to time the Commission also funds infrastructure projects aiming at the improvement of socio-economic conditions in refugee camps (e.g. water and sanitation projects in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon; support to community-based activities in Syria; rehabilitation of refugee camps in Lebanon), and provides humanitarian support in response to UNRWA's emergency appeals. Since the beginning of the second Intifada in September 2000 the Commission Humanitarian Office provided financial support to UNRWA for the implementation of humanitarian operations worth € 45 million.</p>
<p>The current funding convention takes into consideration the support UNRWA is receiving from the international community, including Member States (see attached table).</p>

<p>(FR) The Euratom Treaty has, since 1957, been a useful instrument for the management in Europe of the use of nuclear power, which provides over a third of the electricity consumed in the European Union.</p>
<p>As a result of the Euratom Treaty:</p>
<p>- Member States have transferred to the Community extensive powers for monitoring the use of fissile materials. A complement of nearly 300 inspectors ensures there is no diversion of nuclear materials and enforces the rules on radiation protection;</p>
<p>- the agreements signed by Euratom with third countries and international organisations have given the Community responsibilities in the area of non-proliferation;</p>
<p>- the Euratom Treaty organises and coordinates research, particularly in the field of nuclear waste, which has enabled European research centres to be established (e.g. the JRC’s internationally reputed Karlsruhe Institute and, in the field of fusion, the Joint European Torus (JET) at Culham);</p>
<p>- lastly, the negotiations conducted in connection with the forthcoming enlargement have shown that nuclear power is still a current issue. The accession treaties will consequently contain special clauses on nuclear safety and on the commitment to shut down eight reactors currently being operated in three of the candidate countries (Lithuania, Slovenia and Bulgaria).</p>
<p>The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will therefore endeavour in the context of the Convention to preserve this fundamental acquis which has enabled the Union to equip itself with one of the best nuclear energy control systems anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that two proposals for directives adopted on 30 January 2003<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will shortly extend this control to the cover the safety of nuclear installations and the management of radioactive waste.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The advantages of the Community Patent will make the patent system as a whole more accessible and relevant to innovators' needs, and should accordingly lead to increased numbers of applications for patents. While these advantages will be of benefit to all users, they will be felt most keenly by smaller companies with tight budgets, who up to now might not have been in a position to seek broad protection for their innovations.</p>
<p>However, the patent system is only one component of the overall environment in which innovation is nurtured and rewarded. The Community may have an excellent patent system, but it will not be used by its enterprises if they are not innovating. The overall improvement of research and innovation will contribute to the ‘Lisbon strategy’ endorsed in March 2000 at the Lisbon European Council, which aims to make the Union the world’s most dynamic and competitive economy.</p>
<p>More specifically, at the 2002 Barcelona European Council, the heads of State and Government agreed that research and technological development investment in the Union must be increased with the aim of approaching 3% of gross domestic product by 2010, up from 1.9% in 2000. About two-thirds of the total should be funded by business.</p>
<p>An action plan for reaching this ‘3%’ objective will be published shortly by the Commission, including recommendations in a number of areas, one of which being intellectual property. In particular, intellectual property rights awareness and training issues will be important. Indeed, for a successful Community patent for all users – including small and medium-sized enterprises and public research organisations – it is also important that they be able to make optimal use of it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0168"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was established on 11 November 2002 by Council Regulation 2012/2002<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. On 11 December 2002 the Commission adopted four decisions granting EUSF-aid to Germany (€ 444 million), Austria (€ 134 million), the Czech Republic (€ 129 million) and France (€ 21 million). Implementation agreements with these four countries were concluded and the grants paid out in full before the end of the year. In accordance with the Regulation the beneficiary countries are now in the process of implementing the aid within the twelve month period provided for. The Commission will monitor implementation.</p>
<p>For the current year, four requests to mobilise the EUSF were addressed to the Commission in January 2003 by the Italian authorities (for the disasters following the eruption of Mount Etna, the earthquake in Molise and the flooding in northern Italy) and by Spain (for the Prestige tanker accident). These requests are in the process of being assessed by the Commission. If one or more are found on analysis to meet the criteria of the regulation, it is for the Commission to propose to the budgetary authority to make available the appropriate amount from the Community budget. A fifth request to mobilise the EUSF has been announced by the Greek authorities (adverse weather conditions causing damage, in different parts of the country) but has not been received as yet.</p>
<p>In the case of the accident involving the oil-tanker ‘Prestige’, it is evident that disasters of this nature do not fit easily within the scope of the provisions of the existing EUSF-Regulation as adopted by the Council.</p>
<p>The Commission, in the ‘Report to the European Council on action to deal with the effects of the Prestige disaster’<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has concluded that a satisfactory solution to this type of disaster requires an amendment to the Regulation, returning in effect, to an original proposal submitted in September 2002. This would allow the Solidarity Fund to cover disasters of a technological or environmental nature, while lowering the threshold that triggers intervention (currently € 3 billion or 0.6% of the gross national product of the State concerned) and extending the eligible actions defined in Article 3 of the Regulation to include preventative action intended to minimise the damaging effects of an ongoing or imminent disaster.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council Regulations laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> provides for a decentralised implementation of the operations of the Structural Funds by the Member States. The Member States report annually to the Commission on the implementation of the assistance.</p>
<p>Eligibility for assistance is established at level 2 of the NUTS classification<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in the case of regions eligible for Objective 1 and level 3 of the NUTS classification for regions eligible for Objective 2. Therefore, these are the geographical levels at which data is available on the implementation of Objective 1 and Objective 2 assistance. Eligibility for Objective 3 is not established on a regional basis.</p>
<p>It follows that, except in cases where the constituencies established for elections to the Parliament might be the same as the regions eligible for Objective 1 or Objective 2 – which is not the case in Ireland – the requested breakdown by constituency cannot be made available by the Commission.</p>
<p>However, the Member States are free to produce more detailed information on their own initiative. In the case of Ireland, lists of projects by programme and beneficiary have recently been made available at county level (NUTS 4) on the website of the National Development Plan<a href="#defann_29_3" name="refann_29_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Such data could be aggregated to give information on the situation in the euro-constituencies which normally consist of groups of counties.</p>
<p>As regards research and technological development (RTD) activities, the Commission sends, each year, a report to the Parliament and Council, which provides information, at national level only, on the total number of Framework Programme RTD contracts signed and on the corresponding Community contribution. During the period 1999-2002, there was a total of 123 Connacht/Ulster participation in activities funded by the Fifth Framework Programme for research and technological development with a total of € 13.090.741 of Community contribution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The CAP reform is addressed to active farmers. No provisions are established to ensure payment entitlements for landowners who have retired during the reference period and consequently whose land has been leased. The payment entitlements will be given to the tenants who exercised an agricultural activity in the reference period on the land in question.</p>
<p>There is no intention ‘to disqualify such farm families from future payment entitlements’. They can produce without entitlements or, but they are not obliged to, buy entitlements on the market and, of course, they can continue to lease the land to farmers who have entitlements but not enough land. If the question concerns the members of the family who take over the holding in the reference period, a provision is made to attribute them the same rights as the person who retired under the condition that the holding or part of the holding has been transferred by actual or anticipated inheritance.</p>
<p>The third question concerns ‘who will be eligible to claim the payment entitlement on land for which payment entitlement has been established during the years 2000, 2001, 2002 but which has subsequently been sold since 1 January 2003: (a) the owner from 2000 - 2002, (b) the subsequent purchaser (an active farmer), (c) neither?’ First of all it should be noted that no entitlement is established for land but, on the contrary, the entitlements are established for active farmers in the reference period. Therefore the entitlements will be established or for the owner from 2000-2002 or for the tenant if the land was rented in the reference period. In both cases, the farmer who claim the payment needs to have an equivalent number of hectares in order to activate them and get the corresponding amount of aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0183"></a>

<p>Depending on the risk or degree of threat in the location, the headquarters may decide on preventive evacuation of families (crisis level 1) and/or non-essential statutory staff (crisis level 2) and if the local situation requires it the evacuation of all statutory staff and subsequently the temporary closure of the delegation.</p>
<p>For the purposes of information, currently the delegations at crisis level 1 are Central Africa, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Syria, Yugoslavia (Pristina) and the delegations at crisis level 2 are Afghanistan, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel, Jordan and Liberia.</p>
<p>Each delegation regularly fills in a security questionnaire which it returns to the headquarters indicating the exact composition of the statutory and non-statutory staff and the composition of each of their families, which enables us to have an accurate list of persons present to be evacuated if the need arises. These lists are obviously submitted to the embassy, which includes the delegation in its evacuation plan.</p>
<p>These evacuation plans cover statutory staff, i.e: officials, young experts in the delegation, seconded national officials, individual experts (AIDCO and/or ECHO) and their families.</p>
<p>Following the example of the Member States, they do not cover employees under local contracts (Local staff, Local Technical Assistance Staff), or technical assistants that are directly under consultancies, who have to be registered with their respective embassies according to their nationality and follow their instructions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0184"></a>

<p>In 1999, Corsica lost its eligibility for aid from the Structural Funds as an Objective 1 region. Now, however, the French national statistical office (INSEE) has admitted that the figures which it used as the basis for the relevant calculations were incorrect. Eurostat recently published the true figure for Corsica for 2000 which shows that it had 75% of average Community GNP and not 82%, as the French authorities had claimed hitherto.</p>
<p>Given that Objective 1 concentrates the bulk of European structural aid on the least-developed regions, the error affecting Corsica has cost the island’s economy a significant amount in loss of revenue. Can the Commission put a figure on that loss? Does the Commission intend to seek an explanation from the French authorities for the discrepancy? If the Commission were to establish that an error had indeed been made, could a claim for compensation be lodged? What would be the amount of such compensation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission confirms that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per inhabitant in Corsica was 82% of the Community average in 1994, on the basis of the system of national accounts (version ESA<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 1979). Article 3 of Regulation 1260/99 of 21 June 1999<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> establishes that ‘The regions covered by Objective 1 shall be regions corresponding to level II of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS level II) whose per capita GDP, measured in purchasing power parities and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the last three years available on 26 March 1999, is less than 75% of the Community average.’</p>
<p>This percentage for Corsica rose to 84% in 1995 and 82% in 1996, still on the basis of the ESA 1979 system of national accounts. In all of the three years taken into consideration for eligibility in 1999, Corsica was therefore below the threshold of 75% of the Community average. It was not, therefore, eligible for Objective 1.</p>
<p>In 1995, the system of national accounts was changed. From 2001, regional GDP statistics were published on this new basis of national accounts, ESA 1995. For the most recent years available (1999-2000), Corsica is at 76% of the Community average, according to the new system of national accounts.</p>
<p>In future, the situation of Corsica, and of all other regions in the Union, will be analysed according to the statistics available for the years to be taken into consideration for the new planning period for the Structural Funds, i.e. initially 2001 to 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The agricultural renegotiations of the association agreement between Morocco and the Community are not progressing as the Commission would like. The difficulties that Morocco is having in granting preferential access to the Community under the terms laid down in the Barcelona declaration of 1995 are among the main reasons for this impasse.</p>
<p>That declaration, which Morocco signed up to, establishes a greater liberalisation of agricultural trade and includes progressive liberalisation of trade on the basis of traditional trade at zero duty.</p>
<p>Currently, the Community imports around 95% of the agricultural products from Morocco (including tomatoes) at zero duty, either unlimited, or on the basis of tariff timetables and/or quotas set at a level that is at least equal to or higher than traditional imports, while Moroccan imports at zero duty from the Community are non-existent.</p>

<p>The weedkiller Paraquat is made from a persistent, acutely toxic chemical for which there is no antidote. Paraquat is dangerous both to people and to the environment, and is banned in a variety of countries including Sweden, Denmark and Austria.</p>

The Commission itself has proposed that it be included. How does the Commission justify the proposal to include Paraquat in Annex 1 to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, in the light firstly of the well-known harmful effects this weedkiller causes, and secondly of the fact that several EU Member States have already banned its use?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission can confirm that the evaluation of paraquat under Council Directive 91/414/EEC is now almost complete and that the scientific risk assessments undertaken have demonstrated that there are some uses which meet the safety requirements of the Directive. This has also been confirmed by the independent Scientific Committee on Plants. Therefore the Commission, acting as legislator and risk manager has to decide on whether and under which conditions the substance may be included in Annex I to the Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently reflecting, with the Member States, on the various options available for managing the risks associated with the use of this substance. And let the Commission be clear on this - there are risks to be managed for paraquat and where these are unacceptable, restrictions will need to be imposed.</p>
<p>The Commission also needs to be clear about what inclusion of a substance in Annex I means. It does not necessarily mean that the substance is safe under all conditions - it means that it can be used safely. The world around us is full of unsafe everyday substances ranging from medicines, to the petrol put in cars, to bleaches used around the house and so on. The Directive stipulates that substances can only be put in Annex I by the Commission and products containing them be authorised by Member States if they can be used safely. One of the tasks of the Commission and the Member States in the coming months will be to decide on how this may be assured for paraquat.</p>
<p>The Commission has also been asked to comment on the proposal for inclusion in the light that paraquat is banned in several Member States. It actually has two comments on this aspect.</p>
<p>Firstly, the fact that a substance is at present banned in a Member State is not pertinent to the question of its inclusion in Annex I to the Directive. 97% of the substances covered by the Directive are banned in at least one Member State - for various reasons and not always related to safety. European agriculture - in fact even the agriculture of any one Member State - could not survive with only the remaining 3% of substances. Of course when the Commission evaluates substances it relies on a risk assessment that addresses all safety concerns, including those that have led to the substances being banned in a Member State. If substances are banned for other reasons, then the Commission should recall that one of the objectives of the Directive is to remove unjustified barriers to trade.</p>
<p>Secondly, the principle of subsidiarity enters into play here. Putting a substance in Annex I means that Member States may consider authorising products containing that substance. However, it does not oblige them to do so. If they receive requests to authorise products for which they have safety concerns they can refuse to grant authorisations. All the Directive does is ensure that such refusals are not arbitrary. It seems clear to me that any products that cannot be used safely will simply not be put on the market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Since 18 March 2003, which is to say four days after Commissioner Nielson ended his week-long visit to Cuba, that country has seen wholesale detentions of journalists and opposition supporters. It must be pointed out in this respect that the vast majority of intermediate and senior members of the Varela Project, which is coordinated by the 2002 Sakharov Prize winner Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas, have been imprisoned, as have the journalist and poet Paúl Rivero and the former political prisoner Martha Beatriz Roque.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is seriously concerned about the recent detentions of journalists and opposition supporters by the Cuban authorities. On 26 March, the Union adopted a declaration strongly condemning this incident. This was followed by a troika demarche in Havana. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation through our recently opened delegation in Havana.</p>
<p>As it was said in the Union statement on ‘human rights in the world’ at the Commission on Human Rights given Tuesday last week (1st April),</p>
<p>‘The human rights situation in Cuba remains a cause of grave concern for the Union, despite certain positive developments, such as greater religious freedom, the fact the death penalty has not been applied for three years and the recent opening of a Commission Office in Havana. There are continuing violations of civil and political rights, including arbitrary detention, intimidation of political opponents and imprisonment on political grounds. In this connection, the Union condemns the recent arrest of more than 80 dissidents in Cuba since 18 March and calls for the prompt release of such persons considered to be prisoners of opinion. No democratic reforms have taken place in the country. Leading dissident Paya received the Union Sakharov prize for freedom of thought for his work on the Varela project; but the Cuban government has yet to react publicly to the project. The Union deplores the recent rejection by the Cuban government of a visit by the personal representative of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It calls upon the government to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms.’</p>
<p>The internal human rights situation is and will remain an important aspect of the Union relationship with Cuba. The Commission believes that a policy of engagement and dialogue is the most likely to help bringing about a positive evolution in this respect.</p>
<p>As far as the Cuba’s request for accession to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, the Commission believes that it would be a better framework to continue the dialogue with the Cuban authorities and accompany progress on all fronts, including human rights. As article 9 states, the respect of human rights, democracy and rule of law are essential elements of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission further considers that with its application, Cuba has signalled its willingness to comply with all issues of that Agreement, including human rights, without preconditions and in a mutually agreed framework. This means that Cuban membership of Cotonou - far from letting Cuba off the hook on human rights and democratisation - would be a platform for strengthening a real Union-Cuban dialogue on these issues.</p>
<p>This view was shared by many representations of the Cuban opposition met by the Member of the Commission in charge of Development and Humanitarian aid to Cuba.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0201"></a>

<p>(EN) The United Kingdom Communications Bill, as currently drafted, provides for the introduction of ‘Recognised Spectrum Access’ (RSA), which would be available for transmissions in particular from outside the United Kingdom (UK) intended for reception in the UK. RSA would confer the benefit that OFCOM would aim to ensure that interference from other sources should not exceed a certain level. The exact scope of RSA is not specified further in the Communications Bill. However, in the consultation document on RSA issued by the UK authorities in July 2002, it is mentioned that the objective of RSA is to optimise use of spectrum in the UK, and that RSA would be introduced selectively, for example in spectrum used by satellite services where such use constrains the development of terrestrial radio systems. The consultation document states that RSA would not be mandatory, but an interested party which did not apply for RSA could not avail itself of its benefits.</p>
<p>The exact charges and charging methodology for RSA are not specified in the Communications Bill, which refers to further regulations to be made in this regard. The consultation document mentions various possible charging methods, including administrative pricing.

<p>(EN) Recognising the importance of the water challenge, and in particular of providing access to safe water as a basic need, the Union launched the Community Water Initiative during the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The Community Water Initiative builds on the policy defined in a Communication from the Commission and the resulting Resolution adopted by the Council in May 2002. Within the over-arching framework of ‘Integrated Water Resources Management’, based on a river basin approach, a first priority of Community action is to ensure a supply of sufficient, good quality drinking water, adequate sanitation and hygiene to every human being, especially the poorest and with a clear focus on the needs of women and children, with the general objective of reducing poverty and improving people's health, quality of life and livelihood opportunities.</p>
<p>In order to achieve these goals, good governance, political and sectoral reforms are necessary. Awareness raising, institutional strengthening and capacity building activities must be supported, while ensuring participation of all stakeholders and ownership of policies and strategies. Partnerships between public, private and civil society actors have to be promoted, ensuring that those partnerships remain equitable and transparent, allowing free and reversible choice on water services management, safeguarding consumers' and investors' interests and maintaining high standards of environmental protection. Pricing of water services is important in ensuring financial sustainability, although meeting the basic needs of poor and vulnerable groups requires the design of appropriate tariff structures and collection systems.</p>
<p>The question of private sector involvement refers to a larger one, that of the reform of state-owned enterprises. While recognising that public companies needs to strengthen its commitment and re-focus its resources, there is a growing awareness that an adequate contribution is needed for supporting the Community Global Water Initiative. However, before deciding on a particular solution (including those involving the private sector), there is a need to objectively examine all the options in order to select the most appropriate one. There is a clear need to keep an open mind on these reform issues, by putting in place adequate regulatory frameworks and establishing monitoring mechanisms to ensure the protection of public interest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0205"></a>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that, according to the Commission's latest report of 27 February 2003 on car price differentials within the European Union on 1 November 2002, Ireland is the fifth cheapest market in the Euro-zone as regards car pre-tax prices.</p>
<p>As far as retail prices for passenger cars are concerned, it is true that these prices are substantially affected by both the level of pre-tax prices and the existing taxes on passenger cars, which are very diversified throughout the Community in terms of structure and levels. So far there is little Community legislation or harmonisation of national fiscal provisions applied by the Member States. Approximation of vehicle taxation levels proved very difficult to achieve, due to the unanimity rule needed for decisions on fiscal matters.</p>
<p>The Commission presented in 2002 a Communication on taxation of passenger cars in the European Union<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which intended to launch a discussion with the Council, the Parliament, and main stakeholders on future options for action at Community and national levels. This Communication is currently under discussion within the Parliament, and hopefully, the Greek Presidency will bring it for discussion to the Council.</p>
<p>One of the main policy recommendations in this Communication is that Registration tax levels should be gradually reduced, with a view of Registration Tax stabilisation at low levels, and preferably with a view to its total abolition. To ensure the feasibility of this recommendation, the Commission suggested that the reduction of Registration Tax should take place in parallel with a gradual transfer of revenue from Registration Tax to Annual Circulation Tax, and to some extent to fuel taxes, over a transition period of five to ten years.</p>
<p>The Commission, based on the principles of the Communication, and in the light of the results of the consultation process, will consider submitting proposals for Community legislation, which would, inter alia, establish a Registration Tax refund system and general rules with regard to the method of calculation of Registration Tax on used cars, which are transferred between Member States.</p>
<p>These measures would, if adopted by the Council, on one hand provide definitive solutions to problems relating to double payment, or to disproportionate payment of Registration Tax, and on the other hand, would contribute to a considerable convergence in retail prices, both for new and second hand passenger cars.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission takes note of the reference to programmes concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Uganda and Zambia and would welcome further information and evidence based results on these particular programmes before commenting further.</p>
<p>The Programme for Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 lays down clear principles regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. The Commission’s actions and policies in reproductive and sexual health are firmly rooted in the Programme for Action which states in paragraph 8.31 that:</p>
<p>‘Programmes to reduce the spread of HIV infection should give high priority to information, education and communication campaigns to raise awareness and emphasise behavioural change. Sex education and information should be provided to both those infected and those not infected, and especially to adolescents. Health providers, including family-planning providers, need training in counselling on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection, including the assessment and identification of high-risk behaviours needing special attention and services; training in the promotion of safe and responsible sexual behaviour, including voluntary abstinence, and condom use’.</p>
<p>The Commission supports this approach and emphasises the need to provide information that is clear, objective and which presents all the choices available.</p>
<p>Education is an important component of comprehensive programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and improving reproductive and sexual health. A recent Union statement delivered at the United Nations Commission on Population and Development on 1 April 2003 endorses the need for good quality sex education that informs and enables young people to make responsible choices.</p>
<p>The values within the Programme for Action are about ensuring rights and promoting choices to make private decisions about one’s lifestyle and sexuality. It is not Commission policy to advocate one lifestyle choice over another.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
