<p>(EN)The Council appreciates the concerns raised by the honourable Member but as the honourable Member will know, the Council can only act in a legislative manner on the basis of a proposal from the Commission which, in turn, requires an appropriate legal basis. At the present time, the Council has received no such proposals and there are therefore no specific plans to ensure that the principles of inclusive design are recognised across the EU or to produce guidelines to help European guide-dog owners, blind and partially-sighted people to understand differences in disability access and equality legislation between Member States.</p>
<p>I would, however, draw your attention to the general legal framework which already exists in the area of employment and occupation, for combating discrimination including on the grounds of disability in Council Directive 2000/78/EC<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This Directive sets minimum requirements which must be respected by all Member States but Member States may also introduce or maintain provisions more favourable to equal treatment than those laid down in this Directive.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also the Commission's recent Communication "Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunities for All - A Framework Strategy". This applies to all disadvantaged groups including people with disabilities and, amongst other things, encourages dissemination of information, awareness-raising, sharing of experience, training and access to justice. A similar initiative could also be taken in the area identified by the honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In particular the EU is concerned about restrictions on, and the treatment of, civil society and human rights activists. EU Ambassadors in Tunis have discussed human rights issues with Tunisian Ministers and the Tunisian Coordinator on Human Rights.</p>
<p>In September 2005 the EU Troika attempted to deliver a demarche to the Tunisian authorities on the Tunisian Civil Society Organisation. As the Tunisian authorities refused to receive the Troika, the demarche was subsequently delivered to the Tunisian Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva. The Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the EU in which it recalled that human rights were a significant element in its political dialogue with Tunisia within the framework of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, noted with concern the situation of the Ligue, and expressed its wish that the Ligue would be able to continue its work to promote and protect human rights in Tunisia.</p>
<p>The EU has also made clear to the Tunisian authorities and all states and institutions taking part in the World Summit on the Information Society, to be held in Tunis in November 2005, that it expects them to fully respect the right to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Committee, scheduled for 7 December, will provide an opportunity to raise the human rights situation with Tunisia. We also hope to take forward the establishment of a Joint Subcommittee on Human Rights, to which Tunisia has committed itself under the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.</p>

<p>(EN)The export refunds for live cattle to which the honourable Member refers are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal.</p>
<p>As regards non-compliance with the legislation on welfare, the regulations in force oblige Member States to carry out mandatory veterinary inspections for all transports at the point of exit from the customs territory of the Union, at the place where the means of transport is changed in a third country and at the place of the first unloading in the third country of final destination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 639/2003, the payment of a refund is subject to compliance with the provisions of Council Directive 91/628/EEC on the protection of animals during transport, which provides for a mandatory veterinary check for all transports at the point of exit from the customs territory of the Community. In third countries, the Regulation also provides for an inspection at the place of first unloading of the animals in the third country of final destination in cases where there has been a change of the means of transport in a third country and where the veterinary officer at the point of exit from the Community has deemed it necessary.</p>
<p>Irrespective of any considerations regarding the maintenance or otherwise of export refunds for agricultural products (a consideration not known to be excluded from the current debate on world agriculture in the context of the Doha Round), Community legislation meets the concerns of society with regard to animal welfare.</p>

<p>The Council has made its concerns known many times about the lack of fairness apparent in the handling of the Yukos case, and the impact this has had on investor confidence.</p>
<p>The Council is not aware that the penal colony in which Khodorkovsky and his co-defendants are currently held violates their human rights.</p>
<p>The Council regularly raises human rights concerns with Russia in the framework of the political dialogue, at a technical as well as a political level. For example human rights issues were raised at the latest EU/Russia summit in London on 4 October 2005 – at which there was also a substantive discussion of the North Caucasus. The EU is also actively engaged in biannual human rights consultations with Russia. The latest round took place in Brussels on 8 September at which, amongst other issues, we raised in detail our concerns about human rights abuses in Chechnya and the Russian judicial system.</p>
<p>The Council continues to support a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya which has the support and confidence of the Chechen population, and has called on the Russian authorities to ensure that the Parliamentary elections in Chechnya at the end of this month are free and fair.</p>
<p>The Council is encouraged by the recent EU Ambassadors troika visit to Chechnya and the North Caucasus. Under the auspices of the Chechen Electoral Commission the troika met representatives of all eight parties standing in the upcoming elections.

<p>On 25 October 2005 the first ever multilateral treaty between the EU and nine partners of south-east Europe (Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and UNMIK on behalf of Kosovo) was signed in Athens.

Its signing is the conclusion of the Athens process launched in 2002, using energy as a catalyst for regional cooperation, possibly leading to other areas of cooperation.</p>
<p>From the very start the Council, when granting the Commission its negotiating mandate, considered that the negotiation process should be an inclusive one, potentially covering all the countries of the region, including Turkey. Turkey did participate in all the stages of the negotiation and the treaty, as now signed, explicitly foresees the possibility for new parties to join at a later stage.</p>
<p>The Council takes it as a positive signal that Turkey was indeed present at the signing ceremony and therefore expects negotiations to continue with this key country for the region.

<p>(FR)The Commission is contributing to the fight against malaria in the context of national support and through its Programme for Action to confront HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This programme, which was adopted in May 2005, sets out the main areas of intervention with regard to external actions. The Commission acts at both national level and worldwide.</p>
<p>At national level, the Commission acts through political dialogue and financial support with the aim of improving access to, and the continuity of, health services and systems, which is one of the prerequisites for the essential provision of malaria prevention, treatment and care.</p>
<p>Worldwide, in recent years the Commission has quadrupled its investment in the fight against malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, to an annual average of EUR 259 million over the period 2003-2006. This includes EUR 475 million of funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria over the period 2001-2006. The Fund has earmarked 31% of its resources for programmes to combat malaria, on the basis of the requests made by the countries themselves. The Global Fund is currently the leading player in the fight against malaria.</p>
<p>The Commission also supports the fight against malaria through the 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. Funding quadrupled between the 5th and 6th Framework Programmes and now stands at an annual figure of EUR 400 million for the fight against these three diseases. It is expected that new research into malaria vaccines will be funded by this programme over the next two years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0963"></a>

<p>One of the ideas put forward with the aim of finding new ways to provide development aid is that of a worldwide lottery, the proceeds of which would go to development-related programmes.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme has confirmed that such a lottery would be entirely feasible, and believes that it could raise at least USD 500 million per year (with four draws).</p>
<p>It is, of course, up to national governments to set up such a lottery. However, the European Union could make a positive contribution by encouraging its Member States to take the initiative together. There are also legal considerations: almost all our Member States have laws that lay down the legal status of lotteries and allocate most of the proceeds to the State. The establishment of a worldwide lottery would therefore require all the countries involved to pass a law at national level authorising the establishment of a worldwide lottery for development by way of derogation from legislation relating to the allocation of proceeds.</p>

<p>(FR)In the context of the discussions held with a view to increasing the volume and effectiveness of development aid and to preparing a European position for the September 2005 UN Summit, the Commission analysed the main options that exist in terms of innovative funding sources, with the aim of helping the Member States reach a consensus. At present, the Commission is also investigating the use of fines imposed by the EU on cartels that have breached competition rules as an alternative source of funding for development aid.</p>
<p>The proposals that have been welcomed by two groups of Member States are not related to the idea of a lottery.

<p>The HIV/AIDS crisis has shown the urgent need to ensure that essential medicines are available at affordable prices. But today the medicines needed for second-line treatment for HIV/AIDS are up to 10 times more expensive than the medicines used as first treatment. While the 2001 WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health was a vital step in increasing access to medicines, it has since then been systematically dismantled through bilateral trade agreements in which much higher levels of intellectual property protection are demanded than required by the WTO.

<p>(EN)The Commission is committed to fighting for improved access to medicines for developing countries and continues to be very active on this front. The situation has much improved recently with regard to first-line anti-retrovirals for treating HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and special attention should now be paid, as pointed out by the honourable Members, to second-line treatment for HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>However, the issue of affordability of medicines does not depend on the patent system exclusively. Patent protection is only one factor among many others that can influence the price of medicines. The main factors that can contribute to a decrease of prices are increased transparency, competition and pricing adjusted to individual markets.</p>
<p>For second-line treatments for HIV/AIDS that have been put on the market only recently, this can be achieved in particular thanks to the granting of a voluntary or compulsory licence to a generic manufacturer with a view to allowing him to develop such a treatment. Moreover, for those countries without manufacturing capacities, the compulsory licence for export mechanism set up by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Decision of 30 August 2003 can be used.</p>
<p>Another way of making second-line treatments available at affordable prices consists in selling the original drug directly to the countries in need, at tiered price, i.e. at a lower price than that ruling on the European and other developed countries’ markets. In this respect, I draw the attention of the honourable Members to EC Regulation 953/2003 to avoid trade diversion into the EU of certain key medicines which precisely encourages the pharmaceutical industry to adopt a policy of tiered pricing in order to supply the developing world with medicines at the lowest possible price and on a sustainable basis.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully supportive of the 30 August Decision which sets up a balanced and flexible mechanism that provides for a workable framework to allow for exports of medicines produced under compulsory licence. The Commission considers that there is no need to review this mechanism at this stage. There is no evidence that it would contain cumbersome procedures and constraints. In order to evaluate the viability of the mechanism, it is necessary to make it workable and therefore to transpose it in national law. It is precisely what the EC is doing through the draft regulation on compulsory licensing which is currently under discussion between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Commission hopes that this new regulation will be adopted by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that there is no reason to delay further the transposition of the 30 August Decision into the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement that has been discussed between WTO Members for more than two years now. The 30 August Decision represents a delicate balance that was difficult to reach and it would be illusive to believe that re-opening discussions on substantive issues could lead to a different outcome from that obtained in August 2003. It is in the interest of the potential beneficiaries that the mechanism in question has to be a predictable, legally secure and sustainable solution that will enter into force as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Commission does not see the need for a special meeting at the WTO to examine whether the current WTO rules on patents and their flexibilities are sufficient to address the needs in developing countries with regard to public health. The TRIPs Agreement, including the Doha Declaration and the 30 August Decision, provides sufficient flexibilities to allow WTO members to protect public health and to promote access to medicines. What is needed is more dialogue and technical assistance to make developing countries fully aware of the existing flexibilities of the TRIPs Agreement. In this respect, the Commission can confirm that it is integrating in its Intellectual Property technical assistance programmes to developing countries sound legislative advice and clarification on how to give effect to the Doha Declaration and to the 30 August Decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission’s objective for Hong Kong is to come to a result that is ambitious, balanced and pays special attention to the interests and needs of developing countries</p>
<p>The Commission submitted earlier this year to Parliament a report on developing countries’ access to our markets. Its findings can be summarized in one sentence: the European Union is giving developing countries a chance, through trade. In 2003, 40% of our imports came from developing countries. 63% of LDC<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> exports (excluding oil) to the Quad nations (US, EU, Canada, and Japan) went to the EU. This makes us, by far, the most open market for the world’s poorer countries. Our preferential regimes are well used and the proportion of goods entering the EU at zero tariff or at reduced rates is now 79%. And the LDCs benefit, of course, from the EU’s EBA<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> initiative.</p>
<p>Second, our approach is to maximise the development value of the key sectors of the negotiations: 70% of the development gains will come from the core negotiating area, through more market access and reduction in tariffs for agriculture, industrial products, and services liberalisation. Lets just take one example: manufacturing tariffs, the potential is huge, because 80% of developing countries exports are accounted for by industrial products, but also because South-South opening of markets can unlock major gains: 70% of all tariffs are paid by developing countries to other developing countries. This is why NAMA<a href="#defann_26_3" name="refann_26_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> is both an EU offensive agenda and a development agenda.</p>
<p>Third, there is also a more specific development agenda for which the EU intends to take the lead ahead of Hong Kong: ensuring that there is tariff and quota-free access to EU markets for everything, including agricultural products, for the Least Developed Countries; ensuring that action on the trade side is as development friendly as possible in particular for specific commodities such as cotton; providing the right degree of differentiation between developing countries in the implementation of trade rules; enshrining in the WTO<a href="#defann_26_4" name="refann_26_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>’s intellectual property agreements the conditions for a better access to cheap drugs against pandemics.</p>
<p>Finally adding to new opportunities to trade the proper build up in the capacity to trade, or Aid for Trade. The EU is pushing for developed countries, together with the multilateral agencies (the World Bank, IMF<a href="#defann_26_5" name="refann_26_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, etc) to put together a strong aid-for-trade package for Hong-Kong, along the lines of what was agreed at the Gleneagles G8 Summit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Since the negotiations opened, Mercosur has announced that Venezuela is soon to become a new member.

<p>(EN)The recent EU-Mercosur ministerial meeting (2 September 2005) has provided a renewed impetus to the negotiations. Ministers reconfirmed our commitment to the negotiating process and agreed on a roadmap of further meetings. However, trade discussions remained quite general, pending Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Commission is determined to conclude negotiations as soon as it is technically and politically feasible. There might be a window of opportunity to make substantial progress in the first half of 2006, depending on the Hong Kong outcome. But substance should prevail over timing.</p>
<p>Venezuela has announced its intention to join Mercosur as full member in December 2005.</p>
<p>Full integration of Venezuela into Mercosur appears feasible provided that Venezuela leaves the Andean Community and adopts the acquis of Mercosur's trade norms. It is difficult to see how Venezuela could belong simultaneously to two different regions with different common legislation.</p>
<p>However, Venezuela has already expressed its intention to remain in the Andean Community. Mercosur officials claim that leaving the Andean Community is a pre-condition for full accession to Mercosur and are hinting at a long negotiating process, given the technical difficulties.</p>
<p>In view of this, a plausible option would be that Venezuela receives a privileged status as associate member of Mercosur, with little trade implications. If Venezuela is serious about full accession, the most likely scenario would be a declaratory decision in December 2005 with no immediate effects on trade, but setting a roadmap for accession. The subsequent negotiating process would be complex and would probably take some time.</p>

<p>(EN)Globalisation is a real opportunity for growth and higher living standards throughout the world. But effective and coherent global governance is needed to ensure that its benefits are distributed fairly. Steering a course between protectionism and unbridled opening-up of markets, the EU is seeking to promote a model that balances market forces with policies negotiated at multilateral level. The EU's Lisbon Strategy aims at reconciling economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection.</p>
<p>The Commission has consistently argued that EU trade policy must have a social dimension and is actively contributing to the strengthening of the social dimension of globalisation both in Europe and elsewhere e.g. by including the promotion of employment, social cohesion and decent work in its external policies (e.g. in its political dialogue with third countries, EU bilateral agreements, trade related initiatives such as the GSP<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>+ scheme).</p>
<p>The Commission is also enhancing its cooperation with the ILO<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and other international institutions to foster multilateral governance fully supportive of social development.</p>
<p>The private sector can also make a positive contribution to these objectives: Corporate social responsibility is one of the responses to the imbalances resulting from the acceleration of the globalisation process. The Commission is committed to promote the further development of effective and transparent CSR<a href="#defann_28_3" name="refann_28_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> initiatives both in the EU and internationally.</p>
<p>The Textile sector in the EU has been deeply affected by the end of the MFA<a href="#defann_28_4" name="refann_28_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Of course, the Commission is committed to ensuring that the EU textiles and clothing industry will be in a position to meet the challenges and difficulties facing it. Just as we are committed to promoting labour standards in developing countries. Several initiatives aimed at increasing the competitiveness and employment of the TC sector have been pursued in cooperation with EU member states and social partners, e.g. the setting up of a High Level Group which addressed issues such as research and innovation, competition rules and the fight against counterfeited products</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the importance of social dialogue as a driving force behind successful economic and social reforms and will continue to promote it. Social dialogue at European level has been a major instrument to address the key challenges of the sector, such as enhancing skills and qualifications, modernising work organisation, promoting equal opportunities and responsible restructuring.</p>
<p>A major social priority for the EU should be to help workers adapt to the more rapid economic change that a combination of deeper market integration and increased supply side investment will bring. When coping with structural change, anticipation and accompanying measures are fundamental. Workers need to be supported so that they can seize the opportunities offered by globalisation and cope with future changes. Adequate supportive policies are necessary in both the North and the South to anticipate the long term and mitigate the short term negative impacts on vulnerable regions, sectors and workers. Active labour market policies are needed to facilitate mobility, provide retraining and provide adequate safety nets; as well as policies promoting entrepreneurship and encouraging job creation through business start ups.</p>
<p>EU Structural Funds already play a major role in financing accompanying measures of restructuring processes, and an envisaged globalization adjustment fund would provide further support for the ongoing work on strategies to manage change. In addition, the Commission had set up a High-Level Forum on restructuring, gathering EU institutions, Members States, regional and local authorities, and social partners to discuss and exchange best practices and strategies on anticipating and managing change</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)There is no specific Community legislation on the use of guide dogs by blind people in the EU. This is a matter on which the Member States have exclusive competence and authority. Consequently, the Commission does not intend to adopt guidelines on the use of guide dogs for the blind in Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to note that the objective of the EU’s disability strategy is to ensure equality of opportunity. That strategy seeks to enable people with disabilities to exercise their rights in full. It is based on three pillars. First, legislation and measures are in place to combat discrimination and enable equal access to rights. Second, one of the aims is to eliminate physical obstacles preventing the exercise of these rights. And third, it is very important to ensure that disability issues are mainstreamed in the various European policies.</p>
<p>The Commission will shortly adopt a communication setting out the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged EU based on information and analyses stemming in particular from the national action plans on employment and social inclusion, and drawing the attention of the various stakeholders to the positive outlook for disabled people resulting from the new Lisbon Strategy. The communication will also specify the priorities of the Commission’s 2<span class="sup">nd</span> Disability Action Plan 2006-2007.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the field of passenger transport, the Commission published a communication on 16 February 2005 seeking to strengthen passengers’ rights in the EU. That communication was accompanied by a proposal for a regulation concerning the rights and obligations of people with reduced mobility when travelling by air. The proposal established a list of assistance services that could be covered by the regulation. The list includes:</p>
<p>ground handling of assistance dogs where appropriate;</p>
<p>the carriage of assistance dogs in the cabin, subject to the national regulations in force, on flights lasting less than five hours.</p>
<p>That proposal was well received by Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism and by the Council. The Commission welcomed the recent contacts between the two co-legislators aimed at reaching an agreement on the text in first reading.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission’s 2004 proposal for a regulation on international rail passengers’ rights and obligations was designed to eliminate discrimination against passengers with reduced mobility and to ensure that such passengers are provided with the assistance they require before and during a journey.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0924"></a>

<p>(FR)The framework directive and its specific directives 89/654,89/655, 89/656, 90/269 and 90/270<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> have made a significant contribution to improving working conditions, productivity, competitiveness and employment by introducing a preventive and integrated approach to these issues. This new approach is based on the principle that the employer is responsible for prevention, information, training, consultation and the balanced participation of workers.</p>
<p>An analysis of the practical application of Framework Directive 89/391 and of its specific directives shows that they have been the motor for creating a culture of prevention in the European Union and have made it possible to rationalise and simplify national bodies of legislation on health and safety in the workplace.</p>
<p>However, one of the main, if not the most important reason for the constraints, problems and regulatory and administrative costs imposed on citizens and undertakings lies in the complexity and volume of national legislation which, in certain instances, transposes Community directives and which, in some areas, goes far beyond the requirements imposed at Community level.</p>
<p>Consequently, neither Parliament's recent resolution of 24 February 2005 on promoting health and safety in the workplace<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, nor the reports on the implementation of the framework directive drawn up by the Members State every five years, nor the assessment made by the Commission, contain any grounds for a revision of the fundamental principles established by the framework directive.</p>

<p>The Commission will nonetheless take any measures to improve the legislative framework that are shown to be necessary in the light of the ongoing evaluation. Among other things, it has embarked on an exercise to consult the social partners on simplification of the various national reports on the practical implementation of the health and safety at work directives.

<p>(FR)Unless Community law is violated, the Commission does not have the authority to intervene directly in specific cases of relocation.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission would note that compliance with Community provisions on employee information and consultation is absolutely essential, as is good social dialogue throughout the duration of any business restructuring.</p>
<p>Several Community policies can help minimise the impact of restructuring – of whatever kind – on employees and on the local economy. The communication of 31 March 2005 on ‘Restructuring and employment’ gives details of these policies, one of which is industrial policy. In October 2005, the Commission adopted a communication on the latter, and this document identifies a number of manufacturing sectors that could undergo structural adjustments over the next few years. It follows that we must be able to anticipate and facilitate these adjustments at regional, national and European level.</p>
<p>The Commission has several instruments at its disposal that allow it to promote sustainable regional development, in particular:</p>
<p>the European Employment Strategy,</p>
<p>the European Social Fund (ESF) for investment in human capital and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for investment in infrastructure, productive investment and the development of endogenous potential.</p>
<p>Assistance is provided through the Structural Funds in the shape of medium-term strategy programmes, the aim of which is to anticipate and better manage industrial change, thus minimising the impact of such change on employees.</p>
<p>The European Social Fund plays a key role in this regard.</p>
<p>The Commission stands ready to provide a rapid response, as it did in the case of Rover, when the ESF made it possible to react immediately to the sudden loss of 5000 jobs. In this particular case, the Commission supported employees directly by means of individual advice, training, short-term loans and rapid reintegration into the labour market. The Commission proposal for a regulation laying down general provisions on the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund also provides for a contingency reserve (1% for convergence regions and 3% for other regions), which allows each Member State to use these funds to facilitate economic and social restructuring and to counter the effects of global market opening.</p>
<p>Competition stemming from globalisation, and more particularly from the opening up of the Community market (for example the removal of import quotas in the textile/clothing sector) increases the pressure on businesses to undertake industrial restructuring, which in turn means that this pressure is felt by employees. It is for this reason that the resumption of the debate on the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund is particularly good news. The Fund is intended to be targeted at employees, with the aim of helping them to find a new and better job by means of appropriate measures, for example training or increased mobility. Its aim is therefore to support employees rather than businesses, and it will ensure that workers directly affected by globalisation will benefit from the solidarity of European citizens and the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0941"></a>

<p>(EN)Ageing is one of Europe's biggest and most complex challenges. It is already transforming our society, the economy and the relationships between different generations.</p>
<p>Attracting older people to remain in, enter or re-enter the labour market has become a key objective of the re-launched Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs. The Commission is the driving force behind the re-launched Lisbon Strategy. The Commission, and the Union as a whole, has a particular role to play in supporting Member States' efforts by setting the right policy framework.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Green Paper "Confronting Demographic Change: A new solidarity between the generations" has launched a debate on a European level concerning the policies to address the demographic challenge. The aim of such policies must be to turn this challenge into an opportunity.</p>
<p>The Open Method of Co-ordination in the area of social protection is geared towards necessary reforms which would reflect the challenge of population ageing. Early retirement should no longer be a major way of handling problems during downsizing and corporate restructuring. Through such practices, Europe suffers a permanent loss of human capital and growth potential. This needs to be strongly discouraged by creating more flexible pathways to retirement. It is therefore encouraging that Member States are beginning to develop policies on ageing with a strong focus on pension reforms, as well as considering the health implications of an ageing society.</p>
<p>Improving the health of the population is crucial to develop a healthy and active society in which citizens are able and willing to continue working as they grow older. This is why the Lisbon Strategy, when stressing the need to attract more people into employment, underlines that “increasing Healthy Life Years will be a crucial factor in achieving this objective”<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>Lifelong learning is also essential in encouraging and obtaining higher employment rates among older workers. Achieving major improvements in adult participation rates in continuing education and training is therefore one of the five European education performance benchmarks.</p>
<p>Active ageing is at the core of the lifecycle approach as adopted in the new integrated (employment) guidelines and requires the development of comprehensive strategies. Such strategies require promoting active ageing through the positive interaction of economic, social, health and employment policies and strong support from the social partners.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)Demographic trends play an important role in the European Union’s economic and social policy goals. The Commission helps the Member States to formulate policy responses that meet the challenges of demographic change, in particular via the open method of coordination. The latter is applied in the areas most affected by ageing, namely retirement, health and long-term care and employment. Increasing the number of people in employment is the best way of minimising the impact of ageing, and of guaranteeing the funding of social policies in the long term. This means that progress is needed in the field of equal opportunities (in order to increase the number of women in work), social inclusion (in order to promote the integration of marginalised groups) and active ageing (in order to encourage people to carry on working longer).</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Commission stressed the importance of demographic ageing in its Green Paper on demographic change, and it was bold enough to ask whether our only option was to resign ourselves to such change, or whether appropriate policy measures could reverse the trend. In particular, the Green Paper asked questions relating to the fertility rate, thus opening a debate that is all the more heated because it centres on private choices made by individuals and couples. The fertility rate in the European Union, which has fallen to below 1.5 children per womn in many Member States, is particularly low. There is every indication that this is a symptom of wider family malaise, and that it requires political intervention. It was for this reason that the Commission initiated a wide-ranging consultation by means of this Green Paper, and it hopes to be able to present the results of this consultation and proposals for action early next year.</p>
<p>One conclusion that is already emerging is that we must ensure that women do not have to choose between a career and a family. Measures that promote work-life balance and that make possible genuinely equal opportunities for men and women would appear to be the most conducive to increases in the fertility rate. There is in fact now a positive correlation between the number of women in work and the fertility rate, even though this figure was negative a few years ago. What this means is that the more that women can work, the more children they will have.</p>
<p>It would, however, be a mistake to think that any increase in the fertility rate, no matter how rapid and large, would remove the need for us to adapt our social policies to ageing. The main cause of ageing is the increase in life expectancy, and it will accelerate over the next few years as the large cohorts of the baby boom generation reach retirement age. Social and employment policies must be adapted in the face of this imminent and inevitable ageing. On the other hand, even a slight increase in the fertility rate, to a level significantly below the population replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman, could check the anticipated population decline in the longer term and over several generations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0970"></a>

<p>(FR)The Green Paper highlighted issues raised by demographic change, with the aim of sparking a wide-ranging debate. The Commission wanted to give everyone the opportunity to voice their opinions during a consultation procedure, which was completed in mid-October 2005. Its task now is to analyse the many responses it received, which numbered over 220, and it intends to present both the results of this consultation and follow-up proposals in a new communication, which is due to be adopted in early 2006. This communication will also take into account the outcome of a series of studies funded under a pilot project called for by Parliament, and in particular by the honourable Member, Mr Walter.</p>
<p>The Commission is not merely sitting back and waiting for the results of this consultation, however. It is in fact already implementing or supporting a great many policies aimed at tackling the demographic challenge in the Member States, for example:</p>
<p>- the European Employment Strategy and EU education and training policy. These measures help generate more and better jobs, thus making it possible to offset to some extent the decline in the working-age population and the increasing demographic dependency ratio. Their aim is to tackle under-achievement in schools, to raise the level of education of young people and to promote life-long learning and active ageing in order to reverse the trend whereby people leave the labour force early.</p>
<p>- European cooperation with a view to modernising social welfare systems. The open method of coordination in the field of social welfare supports the efforts of Member States to adapt their retirement and health care systems to the needs of an ageing society. One priority in the field of social inclusion is to reduce the risk of poverty faced by children and families, in particular by one-parent families.</p>
<p>- promoting equal opportunities. It is still the case that too many women have to choose between a career and a family, and the choice they make often leads to a fall in the birth rate. This means that promoting equal opportunities by means of child care services and a better work-life balance is a key tool that can be used to reverse the trend of falling birth rates.</p>
<p>- the fight against discrimination. It is important to ensure that all the members of an ageing society can play an active role. The European Union works towards this goal by means of its legislative framework, which aims to eliminate discrimination, in particular age-based or disability-based, on the labour market.</p>
<p>- a common approach to immigration and integration, as outlined in a Green Paper presented by the Commission last year. An ageing Europe needs immigration, provided that it is accompanied by close integration into our societies and economies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0975"></a>

In Naousa, which has been hit particularly hard by the textile crisis, unemployment figures now exceed 40%.</p>
<p>Did the Lanara group receive Community funding? Did it receive funding for the relocation of its operations?

<p>(FR)At this point in time, the Commission does not have access to full and accurate information on any Community funding that may have been received by the Lanara group. It has been informed that Klostiria Naoùssis, a company within the Lanara group, twice received ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) subsidies, the first of which was granted in the framework of support measures for energy investment by the private sector, and the second under the national law on development (N2601/98). According to the information available to us, however, no funding was granted under the European Social Fund. The Commission is investigating this matter and will inform Parliament of the outcome without fail.</p>
<p>Relocation has always posed a challenge to regional policy and it has become an even greater concern in an enlarged EU. Unless Community law is violated, the Commission does not have the authority to intervene directly in specific cases of relocation.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission would note that compliance with Community provisions on employee information and consultation is absolutely essential, as is good social dialogue throughout the duration of any business restructuring.</p>
<p>Several Community policies can help minimise the impact of restructuring – of whatever kind – on employees and on the local economy. The communication of 31 March 2005 on ‘Restructuring and employment’ gives details of these policies, one of which is industrial policy. In October 2005, the Commission adopted a communication on the latter,and this document identifies a number of manufacturing sectors that could undergo structural adjustments over the next few years. It follows that we must be able to anticipate and facilitate these adjustments at regional, national and European level.</p>
<p>The Commission has several instruments at its disposal that allow it to promote sustainable regional development, in particular;</p>
<p>the European Employment Strategy,</p>
<p>the European Social Fund (ESF) for investment in human capital and the ERDF for investment in infrastructure, productive investment and the development of endogenous potential.</p>
<p>Assistance is provided through the Structural Funds in the shape of medium-term strategy programmes, the aim of which is to anticipate and better manage industrial change, thus minimising the impact of such change on employees.</p>
<p>The European Social Fund plays a key role in this regard.</p>
<p>The Commission stands ready to provide a rapid response, as it did in the case of Rover, when the ESF made it possible to react immediately to the sudden loss of 5000 jobs. In this particular case, the Commission supported employees directly by means of cofinancing for individual advice, training and short-term loans aimed at rapid reintegration into the labour market.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a regulation laying down general provisions on the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund also provides for a contingency reserve (1% for convergence regions and 3% for other regions), which allows each Member State to use these funds to facilitate economic and social restructuring and to counter the effects of global market opening.</p>
<p>Competition stemming from globalisation, and more particularly from the opening up of the Community market (for example the removal of import quotas in the textile/clothing sector) increases the pressure on businesses to undertake industrial restructuring, which in turn means that this pressure is felt by employees. It is for this reason that the resumption of the debate on the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund is particularly good news. The Fund is intended to be targeted at employees, with the aim of helping them to find a new and better job by means of appropriate measures, for example training or increased mobility. Its aim is therefore to support employees rather than businesses, and it will ensure that workers directly affected by globalisation will benefit from the solidarity of European citizens and the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0977"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission shares the honourable Member’s concerns regarding the number of fatal accidents at work. As outlined in its communication ‘Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006’, the Commission’s aim is a continuing reduction in occupational accidents, both non-fatal and fatal. This strategy is based on consolidating a culture of risk prevention, on combining a variety of political instruments – legislation, social dialogue, progressive measures and best practices, corporate social responsibility and economic incentives – and on building partnerships between all the players on the health and safety scene.</p>
<p>There is already a body of Community law on health and safety at work. In particular, this includes Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, and the individual directives based thereon.</p>

<p>In mid-September, the Commission took an unexpected step in the midst of the decision-making process on REACH by presenting a proposal to amend its original proposal, which demolishes the foundations of the planned chemicals legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission's conduct has been the subject of a great deal of criticism from the Swedish Environment Minister, among others, who told the media that the Commission's proposal 'undermines the very foundations of REACH'. Reports are also rife in the media that Margot Wallström allegedly expressed criticism that no formal decision had been taken in the Commission on the proposal presented in September.</p>

<p>(EN)The honourable Member may rest assured that the Commission has no plans to submit a new proposal for a Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).</p>
<p>From an early stage the Commission has signalled its willingness to cooperate fully with Parliament and with Council in search for pragmatic solutions to key issues which have emerged in the examination of REACH in order to improve its workability, while ensuring consistency with the Lisbon goals as regards competitiveness and innovation, and achieving a marked improvement in health and environment. This approach has been broadly welcomed.</p>
<p>In the course of the examination of REACH in Council and in Parliament the responsible Commissioners have been frequently exhorted to indicate their positions on the main issues which have emerged, and which have been the subject of specific amendments by the responsible committees and/or by the Council Presidency.</p>
<p>In response to such requests, and in the perspective of encouraging early progress towards a political agreement in Council, and a first reading in Parliament, the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and the Commissioner for the Environment have considered it opportune to put the Commission negotiators in the position to participate in the debate.</p>

<p>On 14 October, the Commission threatened to initiate infringement proceedings against Hungary with a view to bringing about a change in the motor vehicle registration tax.</p>
<p>Many people claim that the Commission desires a change which would make it more profitable to import outdated, more polluting cars into Hungary, thus harming the country’s environment.</p>
<p>Does not the Commissioner consider that it would be worthwhile to review the Member States’ divergent practices at Commission level, but with the express aim not of encouraging the export of wrecks, but instead of promoting the distribution of up-to-date, less polluting cars?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission has indeed initiated infringement proceedings against Hungary by sending it a letter dated 18 October 2005, asking it to submit its observations concerning the forms of registration tax collected on cars from other Member States. The Commission certainly shares the legitimate wish of the Member State to prevent outdated and more polluting cars from being imported into Hungary, thus harming its environment, but it considers that this objective must be pursued by respecting the rules of the Treaty and, more specifically, Article 90 thereof (as interpreted by the Court of Justice), which lays down that a Member State cannot tax vehicles from other Member States more heavily than vehicles circulating on its own territory. </p>
<p>The honourable Member's observation that the Commission wishes to propose a change in order to make it more profitable to import old technology, more polluting and less environmentally friendly passenger cars into Hungary is therefore incorrect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission would like to remind the honourable Member that it adopted a proposal on passenger car related taxes<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on 5th July 2005, which includes a number of measures designed, on the one hand, to improve the functioning of the Internal Market by eliminating certain fiscal obstacles to the free movement of passenger cars in the EU and, on the other hand, to restructure the tax bases of car related taxes in order to include a carbon dioxide sensitive element.</p>
<p>Should this proposal be adopted by the Council, more carbon dioxide emitting passenger cars will be charged with higher car taxes. This is because each Member State will be obliged to differentiate the car taxes it applies, in order to take into account the carbon dioxide emissions, in terms of grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre run, emitted by each particular car. The situation will be that more carbon dioxide emitting cars will be charged with higher car taxes, and, therefore, a real incentive will be given to the consumer to opt for modern and more environmentally friendly cars instead of old and more polluting cars.</p>
<p>Subject to respecting the rules laid down in Article 90 of the Treaty, it will be for Hungary to fix the levels of car tax rates and the levels of tax differentiation, in order to discourage the introduction and/or use on its territory of old and more polluting passenger cars.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that this proposal is based on Article 93 of the EC Treaty and, therefore, it requires a unanimous decision for adoption. In the meantime, it has been sent for the opinion of Parliament. The ECON Committee has assumed the role of Chef de file.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)At the last meeting of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) Executive Board in September 2005, in which the Commission and the Presidency participated, the other Board Members (United States, Republic of Korea and Japan) stated that, taking into account the outcome of the Six Party Talks which ended on 19 September, an agreement was emerging between them to terminate the KEDO Nuclear Light Water Project (the LWR-project) when the current period of suspension ends on 30 November. KEDO as an organisation would be maintained for about a year, with a reduced size and mandate focussed only on an orderly winding up of the project.</p>
<p>This issue has an important nuclear non-proliferation aspect. The Commission has therefore asked the Council for a Decision to authorise the EU Executive Board Member to join the emerging consensus amongst the other Board Members on 21 November, the date on which KEDO’s Executive Board is likely to take a decision on the future of the LWR-project.</p>
<p>From contacts at the September KEDO Executive Board with the United States and the other Board Members and through bilateral contacts with participants in the Six Party Talks the Commission has been informed that the DPRK is fully aware about the possible termination of the LWR-project within the context of the Six Party Talks.</p>
<p>The final decision by the EU on whether to join the emerging consensus to terminate the LWR-project is under consideration in the Council. The Commission considers that it is essential to reach a clear decision on the future of KEDO at the Executive Board meeting on 21 November with the other Board Members. Above all the Commission considers it important that such a decision will be coherent with the long term objectives of the Six Party Talks.

<p>(EN)The Commission does not intend to extend the scope of the Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy to the inland waters of Member States. The proposal concerning eels is made by the Commission because this is a common resource distributed and exploited in most Member States. Conservation measures by any one Member State will have a positive benefit for all Member States; therefore common and equitable action is needed at Community level.</p>
<p>An appropriate legal basis for this exists under Article 37 of the EC Treaty, and the Commission's proposal is made on that basis, not the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002.</p>
<p>Since, however, the Regulation of eel fisheries can be problematic, the Commission proposes that the chapter of Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 relating to control should be made applicable also to eel fisheries.</p>
<p>The Commission's approach to eel management is based on the concept that all Member States should develop and implement the conservation measures that are locally appropriate so long as a common conservation standard is achieved, thereby.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0928"></a>

<p>In the framework of this Communication, the Commission has already signed a contract with a consortium of external consultants in order to get an independent study, which will help the Commission to assess the state of play regarding maritime passenger’s rights. The cruise sector is covered by this study, and the terms of reference include specific points concerning persons’ with reduced mobility (PRM) rights. The final report is expected by autum 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing the launching of a broad public consultation on the best level of protection of maritime passenger’s rights in the coming months. This consultation would specifically cover PRM’s rights and the cruise sector will be included, as part of the maritime transport sector.</p>
<p>These measures, among some others which might be undertaken in 2006, will help the Commission to assess the best way of improving and guaranteeing the rights of passengers using maritime transport and the advisability of presenting, following an impact assessment, a legislative proposal.</p>

<p>How does the Commission intend to proceed with the negotiations, mindful of the commitments made by the former EU Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, that the CAP reforms of 2003 would deliver less bureaucracy and better market prices? Whatever happens about bureaucracy, better market prices remain, as yet, aspirational.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission, on behalf of the European Communities, is fully committed to reach a balanced deal across all the different pillars of negotiations especially agriculture, NAMA<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and services negotiations.</p>
<p>On the honourable Member’s question on market prices, it is true that market access improvement would have an impact on domestic prices but this impact would come from any type of tariff cut. The CAP<a href="#defann_48_2" name="refann_48_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> reform has put the EU in a position to make a significant offer on market access, which nevertheless takes into account the need for specific provisions relating to sensitive products.</p>
<p>How to measure the likely implications of a particular offer on market access and its compatibility with CAP reform is a complex question which requires that a number of bench marks should be considered:</p>
<p>The increase in imports should not make the current market intervention arrangements unsustainable;</p>
<p>The outcome should not necessitate new market instruments or new budgetary expenditure;</p>
<p>The outcome should not result in price reductions on the domestic market which would result in a substantial income loss for the producers in question in excess of an equivalent outcome from a Uruguay Round approach. Therefore, potential income losses, both in sectors benefiting from direct payments and sectors not benefiting from them, have to be carefully considered;</p>
<p>The list of conditions spelled out for the market access offer needs to be seen as a whole. The treatment of sensitive products, including the Special Safeguard Clause for specific products, is a crucial element in that respect. Further disciplines from our trading partners in Domestic Support and Export Competition would also contribute in this respect by their positive impact on world market prices.</p>
<p>Against these benchmarks our current offer in Market Access remains within the mandate and delivers substantial improvements in market access as required by the Framework Agreement. But it is also clear that the current offer on tariff cuts is at the limit of what the Commission can do within its mandate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The barriers to human rights and the rule of law in Tunisia have regularly been denounced by numerous non-governmental organisations.

Indeed, Article 2 of that Agreement states that: 'relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guide their domestic and international policies and constitute an essential element of the Agreement.' I would accordingly request that the Commission harness all the means provided for by the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement to ensure full application of the clauses therein on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular Article 2.

<p>(EN)The Commission is devoting close attention to the situation of human rights in Tunisia and is closely following developments through all the existing channels, notably the EC Delegation in Tunis.</p>
<p>The visit of the Commissioner in charge of External Relations to Tunisia last month (12-13 October 2005) was largely focused on questions related to democracy and human rights. The Commissioner expressed her concerns about the deterioration in the respect for human rights and the independence of the judiciary and strongly encouraged all her interlocutors, including the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to take concrete measures to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Article 2 of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement is indeed an important basis to intervene in this regard. However, the Commission believes that this article should serve as a tool to promote positive engagement with our partners in the area of human rights and democratisation. It is the Commission’s view that the possibility of negative measures under EU agreements should be considered only as a last resort.</p>
<p>Moreover, we now have a new and more effective framework to tackle human rights questions: the neighbourhood policy. It is the Commission’s firm intention, shared with the Council, to use the neighbourhood instruments as a lever in the field of human rights.</p>
<p>The global and joint Action Plan introduces a new element – conditionality. If Tunisia wants to deepen its relations with the EU and benefit from our financial assistance, it will have to implement it in all its components, including those aspects linked to democracy, governance and human rights.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Action plan provides for setting up in the near future a sub-committee on democracy and human rights, where concrete issues can be discussed and progress regularly assessed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0942"></a>

<p>(EN)The Research Framework programmes (FP) 4 to 6 have allowed important investments in research on “neglected communicable diseases” in the past decade through their international scientific cooperation activities. Under the current international cooperation programme of FP6, there are specific calls on knowledge and technologies to improve control of neglected communicable diseases, focusing on (1) vector-borne diseases (e.g. Chagas disease and sleeping sickness, Dengue, haemorrhagic fevers, schistosomiasis, filiariasis and leishmaniasis), (2) neglected specific parasitic, bacterial and viral infections, and (3) major childhood infections. Research on malaria, HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and tuberculosis receives substantial support through the thematic priority on poverty related diseases in the priority on life sciences.</p>
<p>In the area of neglected communicable diseases there are currently 27 active projects with clusters in the area of Leishmaniasis (6 projects), Trypanosomiasis (5), Schistosomiasis (5 projects), and river blindness (3). More projects are expected from this year’s call, where 68 submitted proposals on neglected diseases are just now being evaluated by independent international experts. In addition, there are a range of health systems research projects, addressing crucial preconditions for the effective control of neglected communicable diseases such as accessibility, affordability and quality of health care.</p>
<p>The projects the Commission is funding or will fund this year represent a substantial contribution towards broader international efforts in this area and we would like to stress the fact that we are not only supporting high quality research but also high-quality, long-term research partnerships with developing countries, the majority belonging to the ACP regions. This collaboration through programmes such as European and Developing Countries trials Partnership contributes substantially to enhance the research capacities to design and implement new control strategies.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware and most thankful to Parliament for its support to further strengthen our collaborative research for the control of these neglected diseases. The specific research programme proposals, presented by the Commission on 21 September 2005, emphasize the needs for further research in support of health, control and surveillance of poverty related and neglected communicable diseases.</p>
<p>Coming to the last point of the question about funding, it has to be considered that there is not yet an agreement on the EU’s financial perspectives. Therefore, the Commission is not in a position to comment on financial commitments at this stage. However, within the limits of the final budgetary allocation for EU research, it will take the issues of controlling poverty related and neglected diseases as well as the development of new mechanisms for needs-driven research very seriously. It also appreciates very much the support of Parliament regarding the Commission’s proposal to double the EU research funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Sanitary measures in relation to trade in beef and beef products must respect the provisions of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) of the World Trade Organisation. This Agreement does not permit Members to insist, as a general rule, that the exact same rules apply to imports as to domestic products. Instead, the Agreement provides that Members shall accept measures of other Members as equivalent, even if these measures differ from their own, if it can be demonstrated that they achieve the appropriate level of protection. This approach has its merits as otherwise trade would not take place in the absence of harmonised international standards.</p>
<p>The requirements in relation to imports to the EU from third countries of beef and beef products are laid down in Community legislation. These requirements are tailored to the individual animal and public health circumstances in the country of export. However, as a general rule, the requirements are not more favourable, or less favourable, than the requirements which apply to beef and beef products produced within the EU. This ensures that public and animal health protection is not compromised. It also ensures that trade can take place under rules which are science-based, transparent and non-discriminatory. There are a range of checks in place, at both Community and Member State level, to ensure that these requirements are met. These include checks on all such imports at the point of entry to the EU.</p>
<p>In many cases the circumstances of individual third countries require additional measures. For example, imports from countries such as Argentina and Brazil must comply with special conditions to take account of their status in relation to foot and mouth disease. These additional measures are necessary to ensure that there are no unacceptable risks to public and animal health in the EU and are compatible with the requirements of the SPS Agreement.</p>
<p>Insofar as these veterinary and hygiene requirements are concerned, the Commission takes care to ensure that the measures in place in the country of export meet the relevant import requirements, including through regular on-the-ground inspections. Corrective measures are demanded where there is evidence of non-compliance or where weaknesses in implementation are noted. The Commission also requires the submission and approval of monitoring plans for the presence of certain substances, such as contaminants and veterinary medicines, which are banned or controlled in the Community. These plans are supplemented by checks in the Member States on imported products and periodic inspections in the main countries of export. The Commission does not allow the use of growth promoters in animals destined for export to the EU and has taken the necessary corrective measures, including a ban on imports, where there has been evidence of non-respect of this requirement. The Commission agrees that this is a vital requirement in order to ensure consumer protection.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The October meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers saw various countries voicing their opposition to the Commission’s intention to open a zero-rated olive oil import quota to combat rising market prices apparently caused by a sharp fall in production.</p>
<p>Producers are worried that this measure may be being adopted prematurely, before there are any exact production figures for the year which has just begun. Opening a quota could lead to a slump which cannot be quantified a priori, due to the fragility of the market, but which would lead to significant income loss to producers. Commissioner Fischer-Boel promised the Council that she would not take a final decision until she had received the opinion of the Olive Oil Consultative Committee at the meeting scheduled for 7 November. Given that following the uncoupling of aid introduced into the reform of the sector, there could be a significant degree of uncertainty at the beginning of the year with regard to the actual figures for the Community harvest, does the Commission not think that it should wait even longer before adopting any decision, in the hope of securing a more reliable picture of the market situation?</p>

<p>On Sunday 23 October 2005, a rockfall on the French side of the Somport pass blocked a lane of the road for several hours. On 17 October, the French government began work to strengthen two walls and to widen a 400-metre stretch of national highway 134 leading to the Somport tunnel. These roadworks will cause delays until the end of spring 2006. Although the work is urgently needed, mayors in the Aspe Valley have condemned the fact that there is no overall plan to improve the route once and for all. They have also condemned the adverse effects of the traffic delays both on tourism and on the transport of goods. I am most concerned about the situation, particularly in the light of the events of last winter, when a landslide on the French side blocked the route to heavy traffic for five months. Mindful of the Commission’s concern about communications across the Pyrenees, and of the outcome of the Spanish-French Summit of 17 October 2005 – in particular as regards the programming of work on connections across the Pyrenees – what steps is the Commission taking to avoid a repeat of the events of last winter, and to uphold the principles of the free movement of people and goods across the Somport pass between France and Spain?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission has received the following information from the French authorities.</p>
<p>The need for the repairs arose following a landslide in winter 2004-2005, and they were completed earlier than originally planned. Lorries weighing over 3.5 tonnes were allowed to access the Somport tunnel via national highway 134 again in June 2005.</p>
<p>France plans to carry out repairs on the retaining walls in early 2006, as part of structural repair work on this stretch of road. This work is essential for traffic safety in the medium term. It will entail only certain temporary restrictions (contraflow systems), and will not result in any closure of the road to heavy goods vehicles. The French government is in contact with the Spanish government on this matter.</p>
<p>A number of surveys have recently been carried out in preparation for these repairs, which are scheduled for 2006. The road was closed to all traffic, not only to heavy goods vehicles, at night-time only, and the surveys have now been completed.</p>
<p>In view of the above, and given that these repairs need to be carried out urgently for safety reasons, the Commission does not believe that the principle of free movement of persons and goods has been violated in the case at hand.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0959"></a>

It is in close contact with the relevant national authorities, who, with Community support, have increased levels of surveillance to detect any outbreaks of the disease in the EU.</p>
<p>In agreement with the Member States, the Commission has introduced a series of measures to increase surveillance and ensure early detection of any occurrence of the disease in the EU in domestic poultry and in other birds including migratory birds and to minimise the risk of contact between wild birds and domestic poultry. These measures include a temporary ban on the use of water birds as decoys during bird hunting in higher risk areas. Nevertheless exceptions may be considered, under the strict supervision of the competent authorities, for the attraction of wild birds for sampling in the framework of surveillance programmes.</p>
<p>A general suspension on bird shooting, including banning hunting in shooting estates, is not considered necessary or proportionate at present.

<p>(EN)The main objective of the food labelling legislation in the EU is to provide consumers with factual information regarding the characteristics of foodstuffs, thus enabling them to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>In that respect, origin is mandatory information where it is clearly connected with one or more characteristics of a foodstuff, as is the case for non-processed fresh products, wine, or products with protected appellation of origin.</p>
<p>Origin labelling is also mandatory where failure to do so might mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the foodstuff, for instance where its name includes a geographical reference.</p>
<p>Although compulsory animal welfare and environmental protection standards in the EU are among the strictest in the world origin labelling in itself would not necessarily provide the consumer with very clear information as regards the actual standards of animal welfare or environmental protection under which such foodstuffs have been produced. For instance with respect to the welfare of farmed animals minimum rules are laid down in Community legislation, and some voluntary labelling schemes exist for products produced under higher standards.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently considering possible initiatives to more fully inform consumers of the conditions under which foodstuffs are produced, and investigating strategies such as labelling to facilitate a more informed purchasing choice. This will also be considered in the context of the future review of the food labelling legislation.</p>
<p>A recent Eurobarometer survey supports the Commission’s efforts to explore more specific labelling measures with respect to the ways animals are farmed. This is why the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals – which will be adopted by the Commission in December 2005 – will also consider this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0961"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is very committed to the objective of ensuring protection of children who are a main target of the European product safety policy. Accordingly, the possible risk related to the sale of small toys with food is an issue that the Commission is monitoring closely.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Commission would like to invite the honourable Member to refer to its position expressed in the replies given to several previous parliamentary questions on the same topic<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A common high level of safety for toys, including in particular small toys included in food, is guaranteed by Directive 88/378/EEC on the Safety of Toys and by the European standard for toys EN-71.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that substantial amendments to the existing legislation need to be justified by scientific evidence. The honourable Member must be aware of a study carried out for Parliament in 2003 which found that although causal link between eating the food product and a subsequent incident is not proven, the risk associated with food products containing inedibles are demonstrably low (RPA 2003).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently discussing the revision of Directive 88/378/EEC in the framework of the Expert Group on the Safety of Toys with the Member States, the associations of consumers and industry as well as with the standardisation organisations. The issue of toys contained in foodstuff is open for discussion in this context.</p>
<p>The impact assessment study addressing the impacts of the revision of Directive 88/378/EEC did not result in new scientific based elements demonstrating a need to address the question of toys in food by specific provisions in the Directive (see http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/toys/index_en.htm). However, the Commission will take all pertinent information into account to assess if a reinforcement of measures and standards is necessary to reduce potential risks linked to the availability of toys in food.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On France's initiative, 13 countries have called on Commissioner Peter Mandelson to confine himself to the mandate given by the Member States in the WTO negotiations on agriculture, since he has gone too far in his proposals as regards both the market access chapter and the internal support chapter. The starting points taken by both the Commissioner and the European Union's main trading partners in these closing stages of the negotiations are too extreme. This could lead to an agreement which would call the viability of many European farms into question and jeopardise the CAP's ability to guarantee a fair standard of living for producers.</p>
<p>Can the Commission provide at least approximate data for various key aspects in relation to these negotiations, specifically for the margin available to the European Union with regard to reducing aid which most distorts trade? Does the proposal that this aid be reduced by 70% imply that the EU has a margin for manoeuvre equal to that percentage, or is the margin higher? What range of products would be most affected by the reduction in tariffs proposed by the Commissioner? What are the main products which would fall within the category of 'sensitive products'?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)In the Doha Round it is the ambitious CAP<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>-reform of 2003 which constitute the Commission’s negotiating brief. It is the reform process of CAP which is determining the negotiating margin of the EC in the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council also concluded (in June 2003) that the margin of manoeuvre provided by the CAP Reform of 2003 can only be used in the Doha negotiations on “condition of equivalent agricultural concessions from WTO<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> partners”.</p>
<p>On market access, the Commission is guided by the Council’s endorsement of the 2004 July Framework Agreement and its call for “substantial new market access” in agriculture. Consequently, the recent EU offer provides substantial new market access in agriculture, which is a crucial component of the development goals expressed by the Council, but does not jeopardize the EU farming sector and does not go beyond our margin of maneuver in terms of tariff reduction for any products.</p>
<p>On the issue of sensitive products, the framework agreement clearly provides that we have to negotiate a number of sensitive products and not to negotiate what products will enter in the sensitive products category. The actual choice of sensitive products by the EU will be the subject of in depth discussions with the Member States at the appropriate moment.</p>
<p>On domestic support, the figures that the EC has recently put on the table (eg. AMS -70%, de minimis -80%, overall cut -70%) are in line with the CAP reform and with the Council mandate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The “Education and Training 2010” Work Programme is the policy tool to support increased cooperation among Member States to improve the performance and equity of their education systems. The aim is also to implement coherent and comprehensive strategies for lifelong learning, ensuring access for all, and in particular the most disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Annual Report provides information on the follow-up of the 29 indicators selected for monitoring the Work Programme. In addition to this Report, the joint Council/Commission biennial reporting on the implementation of the Work Programme allows the Commission and the Council to take stock of progress achieved. The Commission has just adopted its contribution to the 2006 Joint Report (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0549">COM (2005)549</a>), based on Member States’ national reports. It underlines that despite important efforts made by all countries in key areas of the Work Programme, there is indeed too little progress against those European benchmarks fixed for improving young people’s qualifications and competences, and adult participation in lifelong learning. The rate of early school leavers in the Union also remains too high. However, we have no evidence that this situation has led directly to a higher uptake of private education.</p>
<p>In its Communication, the Commission stresses the need to accelerate the pace of reforms and to make sure that those reforms support both the efficiency and equity objectives of education and training systems. To help Member States in their reform efforts, the Commission is supporting peer learning activities among Member States. Peer learning activities aim to foster the exchange of good policy practices and to support progress towards the objectives set for 2010, in particular in relation to the five benchmarks adopted by the Education Council in 2003. The responsibility for implementing the necessary reforms to change the situation is the responsibility of each Member State.</p>
<p>Crucial areas in need of reform are already covered by four of the existing European benchmarks, namely the ones on early school leavers, on completion of upper secondary education, on reading literacy and participation in lifelong learning, and on adult participation in lifelong learning. Therefore, the Commission does not consider, at this stage, proposing additional European benchmarks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
