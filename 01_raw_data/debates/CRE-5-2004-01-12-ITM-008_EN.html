<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Thank you for your kind words, Mr President. I hope I shall survive this time and avoid catching yet another cold.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to more serious issues, I should like to thank Parliament, especially the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Particular thanks are due to the two rapporteurs, Mr Seppänen and Mr Vidal-Quadras. I appreciate all the work undertaken jointly and welcome the results achieved. I believe the latter are very reasonable as regards the Commission’s drafts for a directive concerning safety at nuclear facilities, the management of spent fuel and the management of radioactive waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The determination to contribute to the setting up of a Community approach to nuclear safety has been abundantly clear both at discussions at the Commission and at the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Nuclear safety was understood in its broadest sense, encompassing both the safety of facilities and the management of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s ruling will of course complement the Commission’s proposal and provide additional food for thought. In addition, it will provide significant political support. It should be borne in mind that difficulties have arisen at Council regarding several Member States, and such support would be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important for Parliament to support the Commission’s initiative concerning the use of legally binding instruments to provide a framework for nuclear safety and the management of nuclear waste in the future enlarged Europe of 25 Member States. This approach is the only way of putting in place clear and stable general legal rules. Such rules will guarantee future prospects for investments in electricity companies. They will also have the effect of informing and reassuring public opinion about the conditions in which nuclear energy is used within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the draft directive laying down the basic duties and general principles regarding the safety of nuclear facilities. The Commission has complied with Parliament’s request that nuclear safety be guaranteed during the decommissioning process also. This is a sensitive issue. It involves both concerns for nuclear safety and the desire for fair competition in the electricity market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euratom Treaty constitutes the legal basis for the Commission’s proposal. This proposal allows Parliament’s expectations to be met in a balanced manner. Parliament’s amendments have been studied. In particular, it emerges quite clearly that the ruling to be forwarded to the Council will make it possible to counter any attempt by Member States to change the substance of the Commission’s initial proposals. The Commission is willing to show some flexibility. It is not, however, prepared to sacrifice the political objectives set when drafting the proposals. We therefore believe it is essential to ensure sufficient financial resources are available to ensure decommissioning takes place safely.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the draft directive on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. I have taken careful note of the proposals to amend the timetable for approving permanent storage facilities and their entry into use. Initial discussion in the Council suggests the latter is favourably inclined to this idea. Clearly, both sides are of the opinion that the timetable put forward by the Commission is over-ambitious. Personally, I still believe the difficulty does not lie with the dates themselves. The difficulty is that most Member States have not made sufficient progress with their decisions and preparations. I would not like to suggest that this applies to Finland, however. Finland is very much in the lead, and has taken specific decisions. Sweden has made a great deal of progress too. Returning to the timetable, the Commission is prepared to be flexible if specific and reasonable time periods are suggested. This is actually in line with Parliament’s proposal, namely to allow more time but to set specific dates. We are prepared to allow flexibility in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">There is international consensus at technical level on the final storage of high-level and long-life radioactive waste in deep geological repositories. All are agreed that at present this is the best method of isolating radioactive waste from human beings and from the environment for the long periods necessary. This does not of course mean that other solutions are not being researched. The Commission does not wish to close any doors. The fact that deep geological repositories are currently the best solution does not necessarily mean they will be the best solution ten years from now. We are inspired solely by our desire to ensure safe management of radioactive waste in the long term. Our aim is to provide effective protection for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, there is scope for proposing an increase for research and development if necessary. I must emphasise we are not writing off other solutions. Quite the opposite is the case. Allow me to reiterate that we are in favour of further research in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, by way of summary I should like to confirm the main objective of the Commission’s proposal. This is simply to guarantee the highest possible level of safety within an enlarged Europe. In addition to guaranteeing a high level of safety, we wish to make this whole issue more transparent for the citizens and especially for Parliament. We also wish to ensure that the nuclear sector tackles the problem of managing radioactive waste. We hope the various Member States will make a determined effort in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that implementation of this Community legislation will result in stable and balanced general rules for the European Community sector. Such rules will allow the sector to develop without any part of it being favoured or discriminated against. I think I should mention how pleasing it is to note that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are cooperating to endow the enlarged Union with a genuine Community policy on nuclear safety. Such policies already exist for other areas. As I recalled when presenting these initiatives, in the past the Commission tabled proposals on issues such as acceptable levels for bathing waters in the European Union. Parliament and the Council adopted these proposals. There is nothing currently laid down on European levels in this area, however.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, Mr President, I should like to respond to a point made by Mrs McNally at the start of this sitting. I must point out again to Mrs McNally that it was another honourable Member of this House who declared the Kyoto Protocol dead. I never said so. What I have actually said and will now reiterate is as follows. Unfortunately, it is very likely that the Protocol will not gain the number of ratifications needed for it to come into force. That is something different. Others arrived at different conclusions, not I. I stated that it is important to continue working on the objective of the Kyoto Protocol. I would like to emphasise this again today. It is vital to keep working on the reduction of greenhouse gases. We have to maintain our commitments. That is something quite different. The objective must be pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to reiterate that if it did unfortunately come to pass that the required appropriate signatures and ratifications were not forthcoming and the Kyoto Protocol did not come into force, the Community would need to reconsider. Sadly, such a scenario could come about, as it seems certain countries such as the United States, Australia and possibly others might not lend their support. This could be because of the statements made recently in Russia. The Union would then have to consider whether the measures adopted to date are those best suited to obtaining the desired outcome, namely the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It might prove necessary to consider other possibilities. This is what I stated. I put this forward and stand by it. I think it is entirely reasonable. Regrettably, it is also entirely reasonable to believe that the acceleration of climate change is linked to the very harmful effects of greenhouse gas emissions. That link has actually been scientifically proven.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must therefore continue to take the lead. It must continue to fight and work for an effective, real and adequate reduction of these emissions. It is important to bear in mind that Europe is only one small part of a world it shares with many other countries. Unfortunately, forecasts suggest that Europe will not be the source of future dramatic increases in greenhouse gas emissions at global level. Other countries will be responsible for the rise. Nonetheless, there is a positive side to this. Those countries will become more developed than they now are. They will therefore no longer be classed as developing countries. They will be deemed to be fully developed. That is something we should all encourage and look forward to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vidal-Quadras Roca (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(ES)</span> – Mr President, the so-called nuclear package we are debating tonight was devised in response to the enlargement of the Union and in particular to the Green Paper on safety in energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement brings into the Union a number of countries producing electricity through fission. The safety culture and the power stations in those countries differ from those in Western Europe. In addition, the technical criteria are at variance with those now common in the Europe of 15.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the accession process, the countries in question have met all the safety objectives required set for them. There is absolutely no need for concern on that score. Nonetheless, I would remind the House that nuclear power is not perceived simply in strictly technical, practical or scientific terms. It is perhaps unfortunate that the issue of nuclear power tends to be permeated by ideology and all too often by emotion. Consequently, it was absolutely essential for the Union to provide its citizens with a regulatory framework at European level in order to allay specific and well-founded fears. This nuclear package was devised to meet that need and we believe it does so effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the basic conclusions of the Green Paper is that all options for the future of energy in Europe must be kept open. Allow me to emphasise the use of the word all. It does of course cover the generation of electricity through nuclear fission.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the emotional factors I mentioned earlier it is extremely important to ensure that the establishment of a legally binding European regulatory framework guaranteeing nuclear safety becomes a common objective for the Union. This involves a common methodology and the necessary guarantees that any anomaly or incident will be dealt with by reference to the latest available technical developments. Such is the added value the nuclear package also provides for public opinion across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There was considerable debate as to whether the nuclear package called for directives, or whether recommendations, guidelines or other weaker legal instruments would suffice. In my opinion, Mr President, recourse to weaker legal instruments would have rendered the whole exercise meaningless. What the citizens of Europe are insisting on is that their demand concerning the highest possible standards for these facilities be met. This can only be achieved through a legally binding instrument such as a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the two specific legislative initiatives considered, I can say that Parliament’s concerns have been appropriately recorded in our respective reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I could mention the adjustment of the timetable concerning the creation of final storage sites for high-level waste. I could also mention avoidance of a situation in which European regulations were superimposed on national ones. Such duplication would have been inefficient. Further, efforts were made to ensure the public was fully informed and involved throughout the whole process. I should add that we believed it was essential for the directive on waste to leave open the option of further research in the future. Although storage in deep geological repositories in stable strata is currently the preferred option, the situation could change.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this nuclear package certainly represents a step forward. Your approach to the difficulties arising has demonstrated how, although outwardly frozen, you actually have within you a bow of burning gold and the arrows of desire to take decisions. Lastly, the nuclear package demonstrates something further. It demonstrates that, as one of Spain’s greatest twentieth-century thinkers maintained, the solutions to problems it is difficult to solve at national level lie in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good intentions are not enough, however. The proposal for a directive drafted by the Commission is inappropriate and should not be approved as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that electricity is produced by means of nuclear power. When nuclear power is being used the safety of the equipment must be at a level that is as technically high as possible. The improvement of safety in nuclear power plants today must be a project that both the supporters and opponents of nuclear power are involved in.</p>
<p class="contents">In its directive the Commission is proposing a transfer of power from the Member States to the Commission itself. It does not, however, specify in the directive the principles on which it would wield its additional powers. If the directive were adopted, the Commission would virtually have <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to adopt a position on safety criteria for nuclear installations. Representatives of many Member States understandably object to the directive because they are afraid of high-handed monitoring practices. If nuclear plant safety is to be regulated by a directive, it must define precisely those powers the Commission is to be given and the principles upon which those powers are to be used. Such is not the case with this Commission proposal. Responsibility for the safety of nuclear installations must always lie with the plant itself, by which I mean the polluter pays. Plants have to comply with national laws and the regulations laid down by the national authorities. There must be no attempt to transfer responsibility from the plants to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities must act to improve the safety of nuclear installations in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The latter has set out principles that represent the world’s best shared experience of the safety of nuclear plants and the monitoring of safety. We have to move forward on that basis. The Commission has no equivalent resources. In fact it has been unable to show Parliament it will have the personnel resources it should have at its disposal if it acquired additional responsibilities in the monitoring of nuclear safety. In that regard, the directive would weaken safety, not improve it. Representatives of quite a number of Member States have also drawn the same conclusion. At meetings led by the Italian Presidency they eventually proposed some fundamental amendments to the Commission proposal, and our committee took a sympathetic view of the Council position in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed in its directive that the management of the decommissioning funds in respect of nuclear power plants should be reformed in such a way that they should remain financially independent of other funds pertaining to nuclear power companies. It was right to insist on that. It is essential to the safety of nuclear installations that adequate funds are set side for the decommissioning of plants whilst they are still operating. They have to be managed in such a way that they do not produce competition distortions in the price of electricity in the market. The Commission proposal is justified in this respect. On account of opposition from the Member States, however, the Commission has been unable to produce a balanced proposal, and for that reason it is only right to keep this outside the scope of the directive and call for a new directive on this very issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has justified the need for the directive with indirect reference to the accession to the EU of the new Member States. According to reports received by the committee, the standards of safety in nuclear power installations in the Member States joining the EU in May is no worse than those in current Member States, especially when we consider that the Ignalina power station in Lithuania is being wound down. We on the committee have worked on this basis. If someone could show that standards of safety in nuclear installations in the new Member States are significantly worse than in the current Member States, that would be an important new item of information.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee’s compromise proposal can, I think, be approved as it is. Finally, I wish to point out to the Commissioner that she obviously misinterpreted the committee’s opinion of this matter. Parliament in its report is more in favour of the opinion of certain Member States represented in the Council than that of the Commission, and does not intend to approve the Commission proposal as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will start, first of all, with the legal basis. The Commission is mistaken to refer to Articles 30, 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty, which pertain only to the health and safety of workers. They are not related to the safety standards for nuclear facilities. The Commission should have adopted the correct legal basis, namely Article 203 of the Euratom Treaty. According to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, this Waste Directive mainly sets unified timetables. This approach will benefit neither the nuclear energy sector, the environment nor the public.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the disposal or storage options are concerned, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that there is no broad international consensus. Even in France, the nuclear energy country <span class="italic">par excellence</span>, national legislation requires a series of different options to be considered. As for timetables, not one single new Member State will be able to meet the timetable under the current circumstances, not even Finland, which will need another two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy also takes the view that the export of waste outside of Europe will have to be banned and that the proposed directive must be amended accordingly. The Commission must publish its current plans for the management and disposal and storage of radioactive waste of all Member States and allow comments to be made. It must draw up a list of waste whose export is not allowed – not into the atmosphere or into the sea – and may not qualify for disposal or storage. In addition, a proposal in the style of Aarhus must be established following compulsory consultation of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the safety of nuclear plant, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that the current amendment to the directive will not lead to an improvement because the international, worldwide directives that are already in place are more or less taken as a basis. We also have to get off our chests the fact that the dismantling funds should be paid for by the nuclear energy sector itself and not by the taxpayer. We therefore take the view that the directive should be tightened up drastically so that it results in the introduction of the latest safety standards, compliance with which can be enforced effectively. This too is missing from the present proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on the remarks made by Commissioner de Palacio about Kyoto. I assume that she was expressing her personal view and that she did not represent the view of the entire Commission, for she is not responsible for this dossier. I will therefore ignore her remarks with regard to Kyoto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been a long and demanding exercise in which patience has been truly put to the test. Producing a report on safety standards in particular has at times been a real game of cat and mouse with the Commission and the Council. Luckily, however, the institutions began to see eye to eye last autumn and Parliament has been able to discuss the current version.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposals, the Commission began to make slightly curious assumptions. The timetable with regard to the issue of waste was pulled out of the air and is completely unrealistic. Regarding funds, the Member States must have the chance to decide on the form funds and reserves should take, as long as they ensure that a certain amount of funding is available if needed. The Directive on safety standards was in that sense funny in its original form in that it did not speak any more about safety than it did standards. Furthermore, with regard to definitions, many concepts remained, and still partly remain, very much up in the air. For a long time it was unclear as to whether there would be any standards, when they might possibly be introduced, what shape they would take, who would formulate them, where they would apply, and so on and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, both rapporteurs have done some excellent work tweaking the reports to make them more realistic and practical. During its presidency Italy played an important and conspicuous role in the Council and helped take the package forward. I hope and believe that Ireland will continue to use the same constructive and cooperative approach as its predecessor, Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still unclear what the added value of the proposal for safety standards will be. It goes without saying that the role of the national supervisory authorities will have to be called into question. Cooperation between the EU, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Western European Nuclear Regulators’ Association must be stepped up. Owing to its obvious lack of resources and know-how, the Commission cannot now nor in the future have anything but a coordinating role in cooperation on nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposed format, then, this is not any complete directive package, but, as I see it, those who are in favour of safe and environmentally friendly nuclear power will have no alternative but to give their support to both reports in their present form. I am for high safety standards and voluntary cooperation between the Member States and the authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Linkohr (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs most warmly for these reports, as also all those who played their part in preparing this debate. I would, though, also like to thank the Commission, for in my many years in this House – almost twenty-five of them so far – never before has a Commission dared to put its head as far above the parapet as this one when it comes to the safety of nuclear power stations and the safe disposal of radioactive waste. I really would like to thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that as progress, as an advance on what we have had up to now, for a remarkable contradiction is apparent. On the one hand, one cannot deny that there are of course such things as radioactive risks and that these are transnational in nature, but, on the other, we refuse to acknowledge that these transnational risks need to be managed on a European basis. These directives do nothing to resolve that contradiction, but we have, all the same, moved on a bit. It is for that reason that I favour a directive rather than the recommendation that some Member States are demanding, some of them with very different considerations in mind. Not the least reason why I favour a directive is that it will be capable of being extended in future. Admittedly, as many have already said, these directives leave responsibility with the Member States, but, as things stand today, that makes sense and that should be affirmed; directives do have the advantage that the responsibility, being with the national governments, will become more transparent in future. What that means is that we – or rather those of us who will be re-elected – will have the opportunity to hold, in this House, a debate on inspection reports.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point is a brief one on the Vidal-Quadras Roca report: what is waste? There has been much discussion of the way in which waste has been defined in an actually political way, which the Commission text has also done to some extent, in other words, that waste is waste if it is not reused. Physically speaking, though, it can indeed be reused, and that is why retrieval is extraordinarily important. It may very well be that, in a century or two’s time, what is now waste will perhaps again become fuel; it is certainly feasible in terms of the physics involved. As we should leave future generations that option, retrieval must be a possibility. I might add that this should also be done for ecological reasons; we may well not believe this to be possible, but one day it may be that.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, let me turn to reduction – of waste, of volume, of toxicity – and I would like to address something that we have not discussed in this House, but that we certainly will have to discuss in the future, namely the transmutation of long-life isotopes. It is, in principle, very definitely possible for transmutation to reduce the half-life of long-life isotopes, especially the minor actinides, and also the volume of these pollutants or of this waste, so that less toxic matter has to be finally stored. Interestingly enough, though, this requires research, and a new generation of technology, and the possibility cannot be excluded of this becoming part of the technologies and philosophy intrinsic to and incorporated in the reactor, perhaps in the fourth generation of nuclear power stations. Although I mention this only in passing, that too is not something that should be ruled out. Work is in any case being done on it and on Generation 4, and the Commission is playing its part in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point to which we had to devote a great deal of attention, is the funds issue, that is, of how the decommissioning of a power station or installation is to be funded. What we have now got presented to us by the Council is a much-reduced form of this, and it is probable that a majority of this House will vote in favour of it. Whilst I think that is sensible, one question that will not thereby be resolved is that of competition, in view of there being not only the Euratom Treaty, but also the competition articles. It may well be that someone will realise, and point out, that there are enterprises that have to put aside a lot of money for these funds, whilst others get funding from their governments; does this not put at a competitive disadvantage those who put money into these funds? The directive makes no reference to anything of the sort, and I do not suppose that this is what the Council of Ministers intended, but I am certain that this issue will again need to be discussed in the next few years. All in all, I see this debate and the directive as progress, and hope that we will, tomorrow, adopt the reports by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do not, on this occasion, have to take sides in the confrontation between those in favour of, and those against, nuclear energy. We have to start from where we are in terms of the planet’s energy needs and in terms of how to respond to these needs. I would draw your attention to a few figures: at present, we use the equivalent of ten billion tons of oil, 90% of which is fossil fuel. Looking further into the twenty-first century, we observe that our needs are going to double by as early as 2050 or 2060, even if we are unwavering in our efforts to make energy savings.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not, therefore, have the resources to do without nuclear energy. If we were to do so, we should both be short of energy and see more serious pollution of the planet. We must therefore do everything to improve the management of nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, regarding the management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, I congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras for the quality of his work. In particular, he proposes an essential change. Each Member State should, between now and 31 December 2006, set its own deadline for preparing and presenting a waste management programme. That seems to me to be more realistic than the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also poses the problem of the nature of the waste in question. Does it amount to freely circulating merchandise? For us, the waste is not ordinary merchandise, and we agree to specifying that, although a Member State’s programme may provide for the transfer of nuclear waste to another Member State, no Member State is obliged to accept such imports.</p>
<p class="contents">When, finally, it comes to the safety of nuclear installations while they are being operated or decommissioned, I also wish to congratulate my colleague, Mr Seppänen, who has been very skilful in carrying out his work as rapporteur. The Commission’s proposal was not really satisfactory, and Mr Seppänen was not content to ask the Commission to try to come up with something better. Instead, he listed the shortcomings and put forward constructive criticisms, which my group and I support.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, our European Parliament and our Commission may genuinely be said to have worked well, overall, on this nuclear package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think her remarks addressed earlier to Mrs McNally were actually intended for me, but I am very happy to see that she is not symbolically sporting a headscarf in solidarity with Islamic fundamentalists. I would be appalled at that, but I am sure it is something she would never do.</p>
<p class="contents">Your proposals, Commissioner, are totally misleading. Whilst superficially proposing to increase nuclear safety, they hide their true purpose which is to revitalise a totally defunct nuclear industry. The nuclear package represents a coordinated effort to prepare for further development of atomic power in an enlarged European Union and it has been stripped of all meaningful safety requirements. It will receive no support from my Group. Commissioner, you may have bitten off more than you can chew, but that is for you to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">As an Irish MEP I would strongly urge non-nuclear countries like Ireland to take a stand against this nuclear package and I am sorry that it has not so far done this. I will be urging it to adopt such a position as this directive is not a first step in the right direction, but in fact a giant leap backwards. It is a recipe for a bureaucratic nightmare with zero safety gains.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding safety, the draft directive claimed that it would introduce common safety standards, but this directive, as drafted, does not set out those safety standards. It only sets out basic obligations and general principles. In fact it calls for pre-arranged reviews of nuclear safety authorities, rather than a proper inspection of nuclear facilities, and that is clearly nonsense.</p>
<p class="contents">The current draft will not lead to an increase in nuclear safety in the EU or the accession countries, because all nuclear states in the EU and the accession countries are already parties to the International Atomic Energy Agency's Nuclear Safety Convention and must already report on the safety of nuclear power stations. Some inspectors think that it will actually have a negative effect.</p>
<p class="contents">On the particularly thorny question of reprocessing, we have high level waste that needs to be made safe much faster than is currently the case, and this processing should be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the justification for this directive? It is illogical given the huge variation in size of nuclear programmes. We need to exclude the exportation of waste and indeed, as has already been said, the timetable is way out of line with what the Member States can achieve. Think again, Commissioner. This is a bureaucratic nightmare and a nonsense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That decisions should be taken about support measures for a source of energy that in any case gets preferential treatment without the approval of the representatives of the European people is contrary to every democratic principle. In the final analysis, this is about nothing more or less than European taxpayers’ money. Any increase in Euratom’s credit limit should be firmly rejected. The transaction limit has not yet been reached, so there is not even any need for the increase. Safety improvements and decommissioning measures can and must be funded from the money available. Euratom loans are fundamentally inconsistent with the directive on the internal market in energy and put other energy sources at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the directive on nuclear plant provides for nothing other than the control of the controllers, but it does not, unfortunately, put in place the uniformly rigorous, transparent and legally binding norms in the field of nuclear safety that Parliament has been demanding for years. If further hindrances to free competition in the energy market are to be avoided, the funds for decommissioning and waste disposal must be administered transparently and in strict and invariable separation from each other, and must be subject to monitoring by an independent authority. The way the rules are applied in France and Germany, with reserves used for quite different purposes, is a threat to free competition in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be said, in general terms, about the storage of radioactive waste is that the mere fact that there is no sure solution to how to dispose of nuclear waste shows how irresponsible it is to build new nuclear power stations. It also beggars belief that certain countries are able to get rid of waste that gives off radiation by exporting it to – of all places – those third countries that are not so fussy about nuclear safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To paraphrase William Shakespeare, I come not to bury radioactive waste but to praise nuclear energy: that is to say, to provide a reminder that nuclear energy is vitally important to European electricity and, therefore, our people must have great confidence in the safety standards applied to its generation.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been an interesting debate about whether this should be a directive, which is binding, or a non-binding instrument. I would remind colleagues that the existing instruments covering nuclear safety – national regulations and the Convention on Nuclear Safety – are perfectly and wholly adequate. Let us remember that the buck stops with the Member States. However, what a directive can do is to change the perception individuals have of nuclear energy and their judgment as to whether or not it is safe. That is vitally important.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the changes to the treatment of decommissioning funds in the main text, which was a very important issue. I also welcome the principle involved in the proposal on decommissioning waste – the principle of setting deadlines for adopting a programme and choosing a site. I say that because Member States must take decisions and they – my own included – must be pushed into taking those decisions. That is the vital role of this proposal.

Although she was actually speaking to Mrs Ahern, I hope that whatever happens to Kyoto, we would pursue policies on a no-regrets basis, which, apart from helping the climate, make complete business sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The package is, as the Commissioner said, a response to the European Parliament, which is in turn responding to the very real fears and concerns of European citizens, as is our duty – my voice sounds rather similar to yours, Commissioner, I apologise: I too have a cold.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever one's views about the future of nuclear power, mine are considerably less optimistic than those of others who have spoken. I believe that market liberalisation means there is practically no future for nuclear power without a huge change in the ability of states to promote it. I believe that technical advancement in other forms of energy, including perhaps nuclear fusion, make the future very unsure. We are talking about the present, namely the present dangers of nuclear accidents and the present uncertainty surrounding the disposal of existing radioactive waste. I regret very much that the changes which the Convention could have made to the Euratom Treaty were not seized upon – in great cowardice – by Member States and by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as radioactive waste is concerned, there is no agreed solution. The Royal Society in the United Kingdom pointed out that the so-called solution of deep geological burial has many uncertain points which need to be solved technically. There is no public acceptance either in my country or in many others of deep-level storage. We must look at other possibilities, including partition and transmutation. The issue of decommissioning funds is one that has been rightly raised and is of great concern. I am glad that has been tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk of accidents, with which Mr Seppänen's report and your draft directive are concerned, has also been strengthened because of 11 September, as has the even more serious security question which is now facing us. I read today that Germany has come up with a somewhat bizarre solution which appears to be to cover nuclear power stations with artificial fog! Frankly, we need to be a little bit more constructive than that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some doubts about the capability of the European Commission to have the resources and rigour which our citizens demand. Therefore, my Group, although it supports the two reports, wants a lot more from you, Commissioner, and from our Member States. I hope that will be forthcoming. Citizens really worry about these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather than opting for the energies of the future – by which I mean renewable energies – you are trying to revive the nuclear energy industry, using artificial means to breathe new life into an industrial sector that is already dead. This shows what close links you have with the nuclear lobby. What you, Commissioner, have put forward under the pretext of standardising safety norms in the enlarged EU is actually a massive programme of support for the European nuclear industry, which cannot pay its own way. Instead of imposing real standards of safety, what you are basically doing with these soft and undefined basic standards is, I believe, trying to give the public a tranquillising pill. What your nuclear package actually lacks is any hint of any drastic tightening-up of the safety provisions; on top of that, you are trying to impose the burden of monitoring the nuclear installations on the Member States. We know that you have no solution to the problem of disposal, so it does not help when you try to set really unrealistic deadlines for individual sites, and I find it even more scandalous that you are, indirectly, inviting the Member States to shuffle off onto Eastern Europe the problems with disposal that they have not been able to resolve. Especially in terms of the illegal dispersal and discharge of radioactivity into the environment, I regard that as enormously risky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to comment on two things. The first concerns waste. Considering how Sweden, with its model project in Oskarhamn, has shown how highly radioactive nuclear waste can be got rid of, I would recommend those who are in doubt to go over there and see how it is done. You take a bus, travel five kilometres into the mountain, and you can see what they are doing. It is public and easily accessible. The method appears to be clearly delineated. It is well accepted, and the sites designated for possible final storage are well accepted in the municipalities, where more than 70% of citizens have agreed to have them.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider the problem of waste to have been solved in technical terms. If anyone wants to carry on a smear campaign against nuclear waste, they are welcome to do so. We are all entitled to our opinions. I am pleased about the option of being allowed to export nuclear waste. In Denmark, we have 230 kilos from our experimental reactor and elsewhere which, under the current rules, we apparently have to store ourselves at an additional cost of approximately, or more than, EUR 100 million. If we are not permitted to place it with the very many tons that exist in other countries, we shall acquire an additional expense to no purpose. We are therefore pleased about being able to export waste to countries that will accept it, that fulfil the EU’s safety requirements and in which we are certain that inspection and such like guarantees that the waste is being constantly monitored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, I wish Mrs de Palacio an excellent year and, above all, very good health. That being said, our Parliament must not be led astray by the Commission on nuclear matters. I am adamant that what we have here is a concerted campaign to misinform and brainwash our populations, who are more and more sceptical about the nuclear issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to convey the impression that, with the wave of a magic wand, it is settling the issue of the management of nuclear waste, whereas thirty years of research have ended in failure. Nuclear safety in the power stations of the new Member States would be better guaranteed without putting some new standard in place or by proposing to grant loans to the nuclear industry, thereby giving it an advantage over clean, renewable energy sources which have difficulty gaining a foothold. Whereas all opinion polls show that the problem of nuclear waste, some of which – it must be remembered – has a life span of millions of years, is our fellow citizens’ main worry in environmental matters, the Commission considers, in view of its project, that burying nuclear waste is apparently the solution, and this without scientific proof. If, by any chance, the European Parliament were to come out in favour of burying radioactive waste, this would be a disastrous political signal for the inhabitants of Bure in Lorraine, the prime site for carving out in a deep clayey stratum a laboratory designed for testing the reaction of highly radioactive nuclear waste. Without any comparative study and without any democratic European debate on the future of nuclear waste, this decision would give the Bure site its one-way ticket for burying European nuclear waste and would turn it into the nuclear dustbin of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still time to respond by asking the Commission to try to come up with something better regarding waste management, both by proposing that waste be stored underground within the power stations and, above all, by putting in place new, demanding standards where nuclear safety is concerned. Finally, a last question, if you would allow me: how does the Commission intend to set about asking France to provide the public with wide-ranging information on the transport of nuclear material, when this issue has been classified as a top-secret defence matter since last August. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is just too bad. Such is life.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe issues such as nuclear power are very serious indeed. It is not appropriate to tackle them from a religious standpoint. In my view it is important to make an effort to be rational. Account should be taken of the current state of technological development, the current state of the European Union, the current state of international and European institutions and of current energy needs. Problems such as meeting the Kyoto objectives should also be borne in mind. There is no scope for rabble rousing in dealing with such issues. Nonetheless, I do appreciate that concern might be felt. I also appreciate that the views of others might differ from my own. I can even appreciate that it is possible to hold a view running counter to the Commission’s proposals for solving these problems. After all, these are the very problems we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">I fail to understand, however, how plainly irrational positions can be adopted on this issue. It is an issue which is unfortunately very important for the future of the European Union and for the safety and well-being of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate concerns initiatives regarding the safety of nuclear power stations. It also concerns the treatment of radioactive waste. Nuclear power stations are not the only source of radioactive waste. I would remind the House radioactive waste results from a whole range of industrial activities other than the generation of electricity. Medical procedures produce waste of this kind too. I am sure honourable Members are not opposed to medical applications. I am sure too that the House does not wish to put a stop to scientific advances resulting from progress made thanks to this technology. The fight against cancer is one example. I suggest all these aspects are discussed. It is essential to guard against seeing everything in black and white in a completely irrational way.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand all the approaches to this issue. What I cannot understand, however, is not making even the slightest effort to have a rational debate on such serious matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the second point, it is claimed that what is on the table today serves no purpose whatsoever. May I enquire how these critics think the Union has been working with the candidate countries all these years? It is alleged that the International Atomic Energy Agency alone is sufficient. Allow me to pose a further question. If that is the case, what is the Union trying to negotiate with Russia, for instance, with a view to improving the safety of its nuclear facilities? It should be remembered that the candidate countries have all been members of the International Atomic Energy Agency from its creation. If there were no added value to the measures under negotiation and on the table today, none of them would have been necessary. Quite simply, all that would have been required would be to allow the candidate countries to continue abiding by their interpretation of the IAEA’s rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the argument adduced by those who maintain that all this means nothing just does not stand up. All this actually means a great deal. It means equivalent safety standards will apply to all facilities. Candidate countries have been required to strengthen and improve measures. In some cases they have been required to shut down their reactors. What is on the table today means these same standards can be required everywhere and can be imposed in future. Ladies and gentlemen, this therefore amounts to guarantees. I find it impossible to understand the stance adopted by some individuals. It would seem they are opposed to the proposals and would actually like there to be an accident to blow everything sky-high. That attitude beggars belief.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply cannot understand how it can be argued that strengthening safety means pandering to the nuclear industry. That amounts to saying it is best to leave things be and run major risks.</p>
<p class="contents">This package is set to have significant impact on the safety of nuclear power stations. It will impact on waste management also. With regard to the latter, I grant that the dates set in the original text were over-ambitious. Nonetheless, cut-off dates will be set. Countries will therefore be forced to take decisions. It is important to bear in mind at the outset that there is no question of deep geological repositories being perceived as the only solution, to the exclusion of all others. Quite the opposite is the case. Research into waste disposal is being financed. In particular, this is true of all the research into transmutation. The latter is one of the most promising options for the future. This does not mean it is not appropriate to take certain measures here and now. I certainly agree with Mrs Isler Beguin regarding temporary geological storage. Finland has opted for this. The decision was taken to set up geological storage for fifty years. This is not a permanent facility. There is therefore scope for other solutions in the future. That is what is being suggested as a way forward. All Member States of the Union would do well to learn from the Finnish approach. Decisions should not be evaded and left for later governments to take. It is essential to assume responsibility and move forward on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the kind of issue the companies can deal with. It calls for decisions at the level of the governments and competent authorities in each of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal also has significant implications for funding. Such is the proposal prepared and endorsed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It may prove necessary to agree on a less radical approach than the one in the proposal. That would be something quite different. I should state that it could only come about in the context of a global agreement with the Council. In any case the outcome would be far greater transparency regarding the nature and management of funds. I could quote a case where bankruptcy was declared. Subsequently, when funds where needed, none were available, because funds for decommissioning had been allocated to the bankruptcy fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I am bound to say that work is under way within the Council. The outgoing Italian Presidency presented a number of proposals. I trust they will be taken forward by the incoming Irish Presidency, as they should facilitate progress on this crucial issue. They will also allow work to continue in this sector as it has in others.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a challenge for certain honourable Members. I would like them to identify any directives predating the present Commission and providing genuine support and backing for renewable energy in Europe. I challenge the honourable Members to come up with any. I mean specific measures, not mere declarations. By contrast, I am certainly in a position to circulate directives prepared and adopted during the present Commission’s term of office. Further, I challenge anyone to come up with specific measures on energy efficiency predating this Commission’s term. There was hardly anything at all, other than declarations. On the other hand, I am indeed able to list the achievements of the last four years.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say that the Commission has not adopted an ideological stance with regard to energy. The Commission works on the basis of objectives and criteria. Its objectives are to guarantee the safety of the population, to provide maximum transparency for the citizens and to guarantee a safe and reliable supply of energy for the European Union. Consequently, the Commission works consistently in the interests of the citizens, employing a range of instruments. The Commission is constantly striving to promote energy efficiency and to support renewable energy. It also strives to ensure safety in the nuclear industry and the safety of radioactive waste. It should be remembered that as I mentioned earlier, nuclear power stations are not the only source of radioactive waste.</p>
