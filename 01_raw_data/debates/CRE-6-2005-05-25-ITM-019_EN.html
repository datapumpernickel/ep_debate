<p class="contents">This accident, in which five schoolchildren were killed and 46 injured, shows once again that we need to do all we can to mitigate the consequences of such accidents for passengers. The proposals being debated today seek to do precisely that. Three of the proposals concern the safety of passengers in commercial vehicles, in particular on buses. The fourth proposal concerns the safety of particularly vulnerable road users in the case of collisions with vehicles that are fitted with so<span class="bold">–</span>called bull bars.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention at this point that I have set up a high<span class="bold">–</span>level group under the name of ‘CARS 21’, which, by the end of this year, will be making recommendations on the shape of future legislation in the automobile sector. This will include an overview of those measures that should be taken on vehicle safety in the course of the next ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the three directives on the safety belt are concerned, I should like to thank Mr Costa and Mr Koch for their reports and for their efforts at getting these three proposals for directives adopted at the second reading. All three directives ultimately seek to make it compulsory for safety belts to be installed in all vehicles apart from passenger cars, where, as you know, this has already been the case for several years. This extension primarily concerns coaches. In the event of an accident, this provision should prevent passengers from being hurled out of the bus, which is precisely how the most serious injuries occur. This is only possible if safety belts are fitted and there is a requirement to wear them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stresses once again that it is all the more urgent for these three directives to be adopted, given that the installation of safety belts in new vehicles must of course be made mandatory before we can introduce a requirement to wear them.</p>
<p class="contents">The only difference of opinion between the Council and the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerns seat arrangements. If we wish to make it mandatory for seat belts to be installed in all seats, then we find ourselves obliged to ban side<span class="bold">–</span>facing seats in coaches, because the types of belts currently available for such seats do not offer passengers optimal protection. However, if we were to ban them straight away, the market segment of so<span class="bold">–</span>called conference buses would be condemned to extinction. The proposed transitional period of five years will undoubtedly enable the industry to develop technical solutions that are better adapted to the various different accident scenarios.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that the two rapporteurs, Mr Costa and Mr Koch, have managed to reach a compromise with the other bodies. The Commission can accept the amendments that have been proposed in their current form. This will, I hope, make it possible for the package to be adopted at the second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of frontal protection systems on motor vehicles – the so<span class="bold">–</span>called bull bars – I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Petersen, and the draftsman of the opinion of the second committee to which the proposal was referred, Mr Harbour, for their efforts to carry out a thorough and coordinated examination of this proposal. I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur for successfully building a broad consensus in favour of this proposal at an early stage within the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Some years ago, the Commission sent Parliament a communication on pedestrian protection. It contained the voluntary commitment of European, Japanese and Korean car manufacturers, on the one hand to carry out a series of checks on new cars to make them more pedestrian<span class="bold">–</span>friendly, and on the other to stop fitting them with rigid frontal protection systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution on this voluntary agreement, Parliament called for legislation to be introduced to regulate the use of these frontal protection systems. The Commission’s proposal of October 2003 complied with Parliament’s demand, and I am delighted to note that the report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism comes to the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept all of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I am therefore confident that this proposal can also be adopted, and at the first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Renate Sommer (PPE–DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am standing in today for our colleague, Dr Koch, who, as chairman of the European Movement in Thuringia, is chairing an international symposium on the Constitutional Treaty there, which is of course also an important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The first part of my contribution to this debate will be concerned with three closely connected proposals for directives, for which Dr Koch and Mr Costa are the rapporteurs. At issue, as the Commissioner has already explained, are seats, safety belts and head restraints, with their respective anchorages in vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second part, I should like to address the issue of frontal protection systems, or bull bars, on passenger cars, again on behalf of Dr Koch, but this time in his capacity as shadow rapporteur. This is important for protecting pedestrians, and in particular children, cyclists and wheelchair users.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first part: tomorrow, when we adopt the Koch report, we will take a major step towards improving road safety. In so doing we will also help to reduce bureaucracy and secure jobs. We know that a properly fitted safety belt can reduce the severity of injuries and save lives, which is why it is right to require all seats in vehicles to be equipped with safety belts. It will therefore become mandatory for seat belts to be fitted, not only in passenger cars, as has been the case up until now, but also in other categories of vehicles, in particular minibuses and certain other buses, as well as light and heavy goods vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">The ban on the use of side<span class="bold">–</span>facing seats in passenger cars, goods vehicles and certain categories of buses is also to be welcomed. However, we should allow an exemption for such seats in large conference buses of category M3, and I am pleased that the Commission agrees. Nevertheless, these seats should only be permitted if they are fitted with suitable safety belts and are grouped together at the back of the vehicle, preferably in a U<span class="bold">–</span>shape, around a table. This arrangement should apply for at least five years. On the basis of the actual accident data available at that time and taking into account developments in safety<span class="bold">–</span>belt systems, this arrangement will then have to be extended, preferably as part of a Community type approval for all categories of vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Council and the Commission have revised their original opinion and now also see this as a workable basis for future type approvals. After all, neither the available accident statistics nor studies or tests suggest that passengers travelling in side<span class="bold">–</span>facing seats in large conference buses are at increased risk. This is due in part to different vehicles being susceptible to different types of accidents, which affect them in different ways. In the case of passenger cars and minibuses, a frontal impact is typical. This means that significant forwards forces are exerted on the passengers, but also of course on the seats and restraint systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Large buses are quite different: in the event of an accident they tend to overturn. The belts’ function in this case is not to absorb horizontal forces; instead they serve primarily to keep passengers in their seats and prevent them from being hurled out of the vehicle. These requirements can be met just as effectively – if not better – by belts fitted to side<span class="bold">–</span>facing seats as those fitted to forwards<span class="bold">– </span>or backwards<span class="bold">–</span>facing ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise that has been reached, with which the Commission and the Council have indicated that they can agree, will help to bring down bureaucratic barriers in the Member States. This is because national exemptions can already be granted today for buses produced in small series, with the bureaucratic effort that this entails. But this stands in contradiction to the internal market strategy and even allows side<span class="bold">–</span>facing seats without belts to be authorised.</p>
<p class="contents">In making this decision, we are therefore in any case contributing to improving safety, not only on the roads, but also in the internal market. In addition, we are determining the future viability of a typically European product in the tourism sector, the VIP or conference bus. This means that jobs in manufacturing and bus companies will be secured and passengers will continue to enjoy high, or even higher, standards of comfort. An agreement with the Council and the Commission makes it likely that the directive will be adopted quickly, even this year, and at the same time the Koch report of course also paves the way for the two Costa reports to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to thank Mr Costa and the other shadow rapporteurs, as well as Mrs Hedkvist Petersen for her skilful negotiating as rapporteur on the frontal protection systems on passenger cars, which really do pose a huge danger in accidents involving unprotected road users, principally in urban areas. We are now ensuring that rigid frontal protection systems are banned on new vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States may also subject existing vehicles to these rules and authorise flexible frontal protection systems, but only if they have passed a harmonised test procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this will improve pedestrian protection and benefit all of those who, particularly in cities, really are the weakest on our roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ewa Hedkvist Petersen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to thank all those fellow MEPs of mine who have been involved in these matters and, in particular, the matter for which I myself am responsible, namely bull bars. These two reports are important because they are about ensuring that vehicles in Europe are improved. This is an area in which we can genuinely do something at European level because vehicles are sold throughout Europe and not only within individual countries. European measures are therefore required.</p>
<p class="contents">Bull bars, which are my area of responsibility, are dangerous at present, especially in urban areas if a child, pedestrian or cyclist is collided with. That is why this matter has come to the fore. Why do we need legislation? There is an agreement between Japanese, European and Korean car manufacturers not to fit rigid bull bars. That agreement is not enough, however. Firstly, it does not apply to bull bars in the aftermarket, that is to say those that are fitted subsequently to cars. Nor does it define what is meant by rigid bull bars. We must therefore have tests.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure involving a directive creates legal certainty, then, both for the motor trade and for manufacturers of accessories. Everyone will know what applies when we obtain this directive. Why, then, should we not completely ban bull bars? Discussions along those lines are of course being conducted in a number of countries. Bull bars can be valuable in wild landscapes. We no longer have very much in the way of wilderness, but bull bars can be of value in such landscapes, and it is of course for just such conditions that they are intended. They are of no value in cities, however. We do not wish to ban them completely because they can, in actual fact, make the fronts of cars softer and therefore safer. What is more, I am convinced that we should not have the support of the European public if we were completely to ban all bull bars at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain’s Transport Research Laboratory<span class="italic"> </span>(TRL) has published a report that in actual fact shows that what are known as smart bars<span class="italic"> </span>do exist, that is to say bull bars or frontal protection systems that are flexible and that also protect pedestrians in collisions with cars equipped with this type of frontal protection system.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee, we looked, of course, at the Commission’s proposal, debated it and, in time, had an informal tripartite discussion with a view to reaching agreement. We have of course heard the Commissioner comment on the matter and say that he is satisfied with the informal tripartite discussion. During the discussions, we said something that was controversial but on which we eventually agreed and compromised, namely that, in our view, the four tests proposed by the Commission to begin with were too far<span class="bold">–</span>reaching. Our view was based on our knowledge that rapid technological development was taking place whereby we may perhaps, in the future, devise new forms of bull bar and frontal protection systems, as well as new tests. That is why the tests we initially propose will be rather less stringent than those originally proposed by the Commission. In this area, we are now in complete agreement with the Commission, however. After a number of years, the Commission will, moreover, review the technical regulations and other tests that might be used.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive applies to the new bull bars of the future, both those already in place on cars and those that are fitted subsequently. They are to be approved as part of a type<span class="bold">–</span>approval procedure. Broadly speaking, this means a type approval as from a certain date for those frontal protection systems that comply with the new requirements and which, alone, it will be permitted to market. Bull bars put on the market before the date concerned come under the responsibility of the Member States. Specifically on this issue of the old bull bars on the market, we have together proposed a new article of legislation whereby the Member States would be allowed to decide what they wanted to do with these. This is something on which we now have an agreement, a fact I am extremely pleased about. This is an important road safety measure, and I would thank everyone for their work and for the agreement we have reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another subject that I think is very important and that was dealt with in the Koch and Costa reports: that of seat belts in buses and in vehicles other than cars. I agree with what the Commissioner and Mrs Sommer said. I wish to emphasise that it is important for everyone that we obtain, and use, seat belts in buses. Seat belts in buses are of benefit to me if I make use of mine; but they are also of benefit to me if my neighbours use theirs. Anyone who, in a bus accident, does not have their seat belt fastened, with the result that they are thrown around the bus, will also injure their fellow passengers. That is something we do not often think about, which is why it is important for us now to obtain this directive whereby seat belts must be fitted in buses and lorries too. We must have them in all vehicles, and they must be used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are few of us in the House this evening and we are debating issues that are of an apparently minor nature, but I am convinced that Europe is built on details, and these are important details.</p>
<p class="contents">The two reports on which I have worked, and which are linked to Mr Koch’s report, fundamentally address small aspects: the issue of safety belts, in the case of Mr Koch’s report, and, in my case, the technical implications of anchorages and head restraint systems for bus passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem to be a very simple matter, and in essence it is, because we have finally decided to follow the Commission’s proposal, which consists of no longer allowing the installation of side<span class="bold">–</span>facing seats in buses since their safety belts cannot be fixed with the same standards of certainty and safety as those of front<span class="bold">–</span>facing bus seats.</p>
<p class="contents">We came across a small problem, however, which relates to innovation. In some countries, particularly in Germany, the concept of conference buses is actually gaining ground. In other words, people can sit around a table even inside a bus. That posed the twin problem of safety, which must nevertheless be guaranteed, and of possibly allowing an alternative service. The solution reached was to allow a trial, permitting the use of these conference buses for five years. At the end of this period, we will carry out an assessment of the percentage of accidents – which we hope will be as low as possible – as already assessed by the Commission, but in relation to a Swiss experiment, in order to roll it out throughout the EU. Such a process will enable us, in a few years from now, to decide whether – and how – we must scrap side<span class="bold">–</span>facing seats in instances where speeds are greater than those normally reached in town centres, or whether, in contrast, this new service can continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it was more difficult than we had imagined, I believe that the compromise reached with the Council on the Commission’s proposal is a good solution, and that tomorrow it can allow us to vote on the reports presented positively and with peace of mind. I hope that my fellow Members do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reflecting on the recommendations made by my Committee, I realise that almost all of these were taken up, which is an unusual situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We worked together on this proposal for over a year, beginning in the last Parliament. One of the things that triggered my interest was that the original proposal presented by your predecessor, Mr Liikanen, was significantly flawed. I want to pay tribute to your team for having fundamentally reshaped it.</p>
<p class="contents">The flaw lay in the approach to the soft bull bar. I would like to present you with a little souvenir, Commissioner, in the form of a sample which I took to committee meetings to convince colleagues the proposal needed to be fundamentally revised. The original proposal would have seen such bull bars taken off the market. The testing standards were unrealistic and there were no separate provisions, as Mrs Hedkvist Petersen pointed out, for a separate test enabling these bars to be made available on the aftermarket. As you can see, Commissioner, this is a custom<span class="bold">–</span>designed soft bull bar far more resilient than the old type of bull bar. It is thanks to you that these new bars can be kept on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to pay tribute to a small company in my constituency called Concept Mouldings, which employs 100 people making these bars and which you have kept in business. I wish to thank you on their behalf. I also want to thank you on behalf of other accessory manufacturers and on behalf of road users, who will now be able to benefit from these bars – though not too often, we hope, as we want to eliminate pedestrian collisions. It is thanks to you that this type of resilient device will now be available on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">This overall proposal is an excellent example of how Parliament can make a real contribution to practical legislative improvements when it works together with a Commission that is open and sympathetic. The bulk of the work was done by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, with me simply acting as a catalyst, and I pay tribute to her persistence in working with your services, Commissioner, to secure a first reading agreement that I am delighted to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have discovered that in Austria, the number of off<span class="bold">–</span>road vehicles has increased from 117 000 to 170 000 since the year 2000. In 2004, every 14th new car purchased in Europe was an off<span class="bold">–</span>road vehicle. On top of that, these all<span class="bold">–</span>wheel<span class="bold">–</span>drive vehicles are actually hardly ever used off<span class="bold">–</span>road any more, but rather, for various reasons, mainly on the streets of our cities. It was therefore high time for the European legislator to respond to this trend, because accidents involving off<span class="bold">–</span>road vehicles put other road users at far greater risk than accidents involving other, smaller vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Accidents involving these kinds of vehicles prove fatal in more than twice as many cases as accidents involving standard motor vehicles. We should also bear in mind that one in 22 accidents involving standard passenger cars proves fatal, whereas for off<span class="bold">–</span>road vehicles fitted with this kind of frontal protection system, it is one in every eight accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution that has now been found is a very good one. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur very warmly and reiterate my strong support for higher safety standards being adopted across Europe in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to suggest that, as we take this issue forward, we might perhaps reconsider whether in the long term it makes sense for such frontal protection systems to continue to be used at all, particularly in urban areas. However, I also understand the arguments put forward by another Member, which at the moment undoubtedly still speak in their favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
