<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, both my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and myself are going to give you full information on the broad guidelines for economic and employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon, the Commission has just decided to adopt its recommendation for the employment guidelines for 2003-2005. It focuses on the contribution economic policies can make to the Union's strategic objective established in Lisbon. The economic policy guidelines form part of a coordinated package of guidelines, together with the employment guidelines, which will be presented by my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the context of rationalisation, and in response to the request from the Spring European Council in Brussels, the economic policy guidelines have experienced a series of changes. They are more concise and they focus on the key questions of economic policy; their general section has been drastically reduced, as well as the number of guidelines they contain, but, nevertheless, they are still exhaustive and they still deal with all the economic problems, though in a more condensed manner.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the guidelines by country, these are now clearly structured in accordance with the great specific economic policy challenges of each country. This also allows greater attention to be paid to the essential issues of economic policy. Furthermore, the specific guidelines are explicitly linked to the general guidelines, from which they stem. Finally, a specific section is added on the euro zone and the challenges it is faced with.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach, however, does not represent a radical break with the past, since the basic strategy implemented over recent years, particularly since Lisbon, is still valid. While confirming these strategies, the economic policy guidelines insist on the need for macroeconomic policies to maintain stability and support growth in order to decisively achieve economic reforms and in order to guarantee that growth is sustainable in the face of economic, environmental and social changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not deal with these three issues in detail. I will restrict myself to making a few comments on each of them. With regard to macroeconomic policies, the current uncertain economic situation makes it essential that policies inspire confidence. Macroeconomic policies must be geared towards the need to promote short-term growth and at the same time preserve macroeconomic stability. In relation to budgetary policy, this means that flexibility must be combined with a credible adjustment. Wherever possible, automatic stabilisers will have to operate fully, but we must also continue to make progress on reducing deficits. These guiding principles respond to the agreement on the strengthening of the coordination of budgetary policies laid down in the Commission's Communication last November. In particular, the need to reduce, where necessary, structural deficits by at least half a point of GDP is included in it. Furthermore, it is important that wage evolution is compatible with price stability and increases in productivity, in order to re-establish the profit margins needed to promote the expansion of employment-generating investment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second point – promoting growth potential – the economic policy guidelines duly recognise the need for structural reforms. If one thing demonstrates the Union's weakness in the face of a global slowdown, it is undoubtedly the need to further strengthen our economy’s capacity for growth and its resistance to shocks. In order to stimulate job creation, the Member States must improve the combined effect of social security taxes, acting both by means of tax rates and of criteria for the provision of social security services. They must promote a more flexible organisation of work, revise labour legislation and make appropriate efforts on education and training. We must also facilitate the mobility of the workforce by promoting the recognition of pension and social security rights. Naturally, these measures must be supplemented with active labour market measures in order to assist in job-finding. The broad guidelines also propose measures to promote competition in the products and capital markets, which stimulate entrepreneurial spirit as well as the transition to a knowledge-based economy. In order to improve the funding conditions and, in particular, access to funding for small and medium-sized businesses, the capital risk action plan must be fully applied before the end of the year. Furthermore, recent events have demonstrated the need for better rules on the management of companies and for appropriate financial supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to sustainability, the guidelines deal with long-term sustainability of public funds bearing in mind, above all, the problem of the ageing of the population. Pension reform must be aimed at improving financial sustainability, promoting longer working lives and removing the incentives for early retirements, in order to make more flexible models for professional and employment development possible. In accordance with November's Communication, the guidelines reflect the consensus that we must do more to deal with public debt and to guarantee that it continues to decrease. In relation to environmental sustainability, the guidelines maintain that economic growth must not be at the expense of the environment. It is therefore necessary to combine the legislative instruments with others based on the market. To this end, the Member States will have to reduce subsidies, tax exemptions and other incentives which have a negative impact on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it also deals with economic policies’ contribution to social sustainability. Employment is the best means of protection against poverty and exclusion, and job creation depends on there being favourable conditions for activity and investment in the private sector. The Member States must take the necessary measures to improve the functioning of the labour market and to allow salaries to reflect differences in productivity. The Commission has established this strategy in a clear way. By doing this we are attempting to be as firm as possible with regard to compliance, placing more emphasis on this element. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, a month ago I presented the revised Employment Strategy to Parliament. I think that today, with the joint presentation of the two packages, we are taking an important step and making an important contribution to improved and faster implementation of the Lisbon objectives, while at the same time taking account of the needs and problems of an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The indicators and forecasts for the period of time in question, with fairly worrying economic growth indicators, show that employment maintained a low rate of growth in 2002. The increase in employment was around 1.1%, which means 500 000 new jobs, although we must of course assume that the poor growth forecasts for next year will also have repercussions on employment. It is therefore very important for us to coordinate and step up our efforts so that we can fire growth and help create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are presenting has a fundamental change in comparison with the past. This is the result of broad consultations with Parliament, the social partners and the Member States; it is the result of a thorough analysis and evaluation of the previous five years and, when it was presented for the first time in January, it really did have broad support from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment guidelines are being presented this year together with the economic guidelines. It is significant that we have taken an important step this year as far as the timing is concerned. This will avoid the confusion which has arisen in previous years, when there was six months' difference between the two packages. We have also taken an important step as far as the substance is concerned, because we have achieved a considerable degree of cohesion and compatibility between the two packages of guidelines, which will be conducive to better coordination and more efficient cooperation with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are fewer guidelines and they are simpler and, of course, they are very clear as regards the results they must achieve. The guidelines are not particularly analytical, because employment policies have a strong national dimension and there are questions of subsidiarity, so that every country must, to some degree, select the means it will use. However, they have clear political guidelines and we do, of course, elucidate specific results which must be achieved in each sector, linked in several cases to quantitative targets.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the new structure? What is the new conception of the employment package? The political basis is the interaction needed between economic policies, employment policies and social policies. So there are three objectives: more jobs, better jobs and a labour market which does not exclude anyone. These three objectives underpin ten priorities which basically cover a broad range of reforms. These reforms relate to people's needs. Specifically, they relate to lifelong learning and the services which need to be provided to the unemployed; they refer to education systems, and of course they refer to companies, for example the problem of bureaucracy in companies and the question of supporting companies and promoting entrepreneurship. They also refer to a very broad range of reforms such as reforms in social security and protection systems, the question of pensions, the question of taxation, especially when it refers to low wages. And finally, they refer to the question of equality of the two sexes and the participation of women in the labour market, which is mainstreamed in all the policies, although there is, of course, a specific priority which relates to equality of the sexes and all groups subject to discrimination. They do, of course, follow on from the previous guidelines, but the new factors mainly refer to the question of the ageing population, the need for policies which will keep older workers in the labour market and the question of mobility. One interesting new factor is undeclared work, which is also a priority of the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer to the quantitative targets. The Employment Strategy is based on the method of open cooperation. Consequently, there are no sanctions and there are no binding measures. This means that, if this is to be more than an exposé of ideas, we need to agree and commit to specific results, to specific quantitative targets. We therefore propose a series of quantitative targets. Most of them are of a national character; in other words, they are set by the Member States, although there are indicators for all of them, and there is just one exception, undeclared work and the serious analysis on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are guidelines relating to the intergovernmental model as far as the participation of the social partners and reform of employment services are concerned and, finally, there is the question of recommendations, with specific recommendations for each Member State. We have taken account of the analysis of the labour market in each Member State and we have looked at the recommendations in the light and from the point of view of the new guidelines. There are 57 recommendations to the Member States this year and, of course, I must reiterate the compatibility and cohesion which exists with the timing guidelines to which Mr Solbes referred.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that Parliament will be pressed for time this year in order to give its opinion on the employment package. I would like to assure you that the Commission will do whatever it can to help Parliament work through this in a short space of time and as efficiently as possible, and I hope that, from next year, there will be better and, from the time point of view, more relaxed communication between us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, it is an insistence on more of the same. The consequences are proving disastrous, particularly in the country I come from, Portugal, where we have entered a technical recession, where we are falling farther behind European Union averages, where unemployment is growing faster than in the European Union as a whole and where we have the highest rate of poverty, including persistent poverty. A change of policy is therefore needed. My question is: when will the stability pact be reviewed, so that we can be sure of public investment, job creation, improved purchasing power and effective measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Can we afford, Commissioner, to continue to suffocate ourselves with a dogmatic policy of stability, which is seen as an end in itself? Of course stability is a public good! But economic policy cannot be restricted solely to combating public deficits. At present, the United States, paradoxically, has a much more pragmatic economic and fiscal policy than Europe. The American public deficit, calculated in accordance with the Maastricht criteria, would now be in excess of 5%. Should not the Stability and Growth Pact be supplemented, Commissioner, with a pact to coordinate economic policy, which would give a boost to growth and employment and would seek to stimulate public and private investment in research on infrastructure and regional development, and in training and the labour market? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is extremely unhappy about the exceptionally short time span. Mrs Diamantopoulou has already pointed this out. You could almost say that it is undemocratic that the rapporteur from our committee has to provide a report as early as next week – this coming Friday, to be precise. We could go on to discuss it further, but, of course, time is much too short.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is serious enough as it is, but what is even worse is that it will be repeated next year, no doubt in a more serious form. On the subject of an open coordination method, I, too, along with a great many others, also wish to be taken seriously. Those procedures must therefore be changed in one way or another, in spite of all the mediation that has taken place in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am afraid that two subjects are missing from the guidelines for employment, but we shall shortly be speaking about these further in our committees. The first is that we are concentrating too much and too emphatically on short-term problems in particular countries – which has just been mentioned. The second is the non-cyclical nature of these guidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the other hand, it has not so far been demonstrated that the countries with expansive fiscal policies achieve better results in terms of growth. In fact, I would say that the correlation is the opposite: countries with more healthy tax policies are those with the highest growth levels.</p>

<p class="contents">I would insist, and I believe Parliament generally supports this, on the degree of compliance and fulfilment of the Member States’ commitments, since, as the current situation demonstrates, unfortunately there are certain very important States which, rather than moving closer, are moving further away in terms of providing credibility and solvency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first question concerns the demographic challenge, which will be one of the most important issues, and perhaps the most important of all, for the future of the EU. What initiatives are the Commissioners prepared to take to create a more family- and child-friendly policy, enabling family life and childcare to be combined with working life?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns what Commissioner Diamantopoulou mentioned regarding older workers. In the United States, it is unconstitutional to force older people to retire. Should the issue of the compulsory retirement of older people be looked into in the European Union too, and ought older people to be given the option of continuing in work voluntarily for longer than they are at present?</p>
<p class="contents">Last of all, I just want to emphasise that it is important for the Stability and Growth Pact to be clear and not to concern itself with politics without there being clear criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the analysis of the labour market in Portugal and the recommendations for this country make interesting reading. You can see that there is a very serious productivity problem, which has to do with investment in human resources, with large numbers of students dropping out of school and with a very large number of people who have not attended secondary school. The lack of qualifications, the lack of manpower with special skills impacts on the field of small and medium-sized enterprises and the field of innovation and high technology.</p>
<p class="contents">If you go further, you will see that there is a particular problem in the field of women where, although there is a high proportion of women in work compared with other countries, if you analyse the female labour market, you will see that it is centred entirely around very low paid jobs and part-time jobs, again due to lack of skills among women. Therefore, the policies which need to be applied and on which the Portuguese Government has, of course, made a great deal of progress, relate to structural changes which have to do with manpower. Of course, no one believes that it is just a question of structural changes, rather than of the overall development of a country, but we cannot ignore these important policies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second question raised by Mr Bouwman, I believe that the very close cooperation we had since November at all stages of processing the proposals prepared the parliamentary committee in question, so that it was able to give an adequate response in an efficient manner within this short space of time. We shall try next year to make full use of the margins available within the framework of synchronisation, so that Parliament can play an active part.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of older workers and how they can stay in the labour market, early retirement schemes have been used by companies in Europe as a restructuring tool for a great many years. In both the public and private sectors, every major restructuring has been linked with privileges or a pension scheme at a very young age for workers. As a result, we have a large number of relatively young pensioners, who are under 55 years of age, and of course it has to be said that this has reached its limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the economic situation is such, especially in the pension systems in both the public and private sectors, that it would find it very hard to tolerate this sort of solution. Therefore, first of all, early retirement cannot be seen as a solution either for companies or for workers, who retire at an active age and find it hard not to be involved in economic life, given that there has been a considerable rise in life expectancy. Of course, we cannot talk about abolishing early retirement schemes, unless this is accompanied by a decision with policies to keep these people in the labour market. In this respect, the guidelines we are proposing also contain policies and specific targets for training, for investing in these people so that they can make a career change, for supporting them so that they can break into the field of small and medium-sized enterprises and set up their own businesses; policies which will keep them active. I repeat that, in the 22 quantitative targets you will see in the texts, there are targets relating to workers over 55 and, of course, one of these targets was agreed last year at the Barcelona Council.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly are we proposing on the question of investment in human resources? Within the ten priorities we refer to, there is the question of lifelong learning and a proposal for a quantitative target for each country's investment in lifelong learning in relation to total labour costs. We must say that, at the moment, the numbers in Europe are very, very small. 2.4% of labour costs is being invested in workers in the private sector; there are guidelines and specific targets for the education system and there is the target of 80% of the population to have undergone training equivalent to secondary education by 2010, so that they can stay in the job market and so that they are employable. And I think that, if these quantitative targets are ultimately accepted at national level, it will be an important political strength for the national governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quality dimension is crucial but, at the same time, there is a pressure to reduce labour costs that has nothing to do with quality.

That would result in a significant amount of pressure on national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards extending working life I would like to say to both Commissioners that many workers are concerned that they will not end up with lifelong learning, but rather with lifelong working.
