I only have enough speaking time to raise two issues. The first is that of Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights organisations and the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Human Rights defenders have expressed regret at the EU position on Colombia taken at the recent donors' meeting at Cartagena. The EU has a special responsibility in negotiating on the Chair's Statement, and I hope the Council will confirm today that it will postpone producing a draft text until the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has produced recommendations for this year. I hope that we in the EU will back those recommendations in full.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, last year's deferral for further consideration of the draft UN norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations must genuinely lead to action this year which will ensure that companies observe human rights obligations. In this year, the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, minimum standards for companies are required which will reduce the number of victims of abuse across the world in future years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the European Union is committed to ensuring that respect for human rights is given the necessary priority, whether this is in the context of relations with China, Russia, Syria, Iran or North Korea, a list that is, of course, by no means exhaustive.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the problems in this debate is that definitions are sometimes blurred and can be manipulated for ideological reasons. As regards the European Parliament's human rights resolution, it must not become a back door for a general liberalisation of abortion under the pretext of reproductive health; here, the protection of human life and dignity is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on just one case which is especially important as it concerns a country with which accession negotiations are scheduled to begin, namely Turkey. However, this is not the main reason why I am raising this particular case. Nor is it because it involves an Austrian citizen who was arrested and whose release may – thanks to the intervention of the Austrian authorities – be imminent. The fact is that it could just as easily have been a citizen of another country.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries me, firstly, is that in Turkey, even today, the mere allegation of membership of a terrorist organisation is enough for an arrest warrant to be issued, even if the individual concerned has not committed any criminal act. Secondly, I am also very concerned that arrest warrants issued by the State Security Court are still being executed, even though Turkey claims to fulfil the Copenhagen political criterion. We all know that arrest warrants issued by this Court violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. If this case is symptomatic of legal practice in Turkey, neither the Commission nor the Council should proceed to the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all I apologise for being a few minutes late.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of human rights, I believe that the views emphasised by the various speakers here in Parliament are to a large extent shared by the Council. I would simply like to consider a few points and try to comment on them.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all agree that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is not perfect, and that there are many criticisms that can be levelled at it. Nevertheless, it has to be said that in the final analysis it is the only multilateral forum where human rights can be discussed on a truly worldwide scale, even if difficulties sometimes arise. It is obvious, then, that the European Union should apply itself to improving the way in which the UN Commission operates. We should play an active role in reforming its operation, and I believe that this is an extremely important point, in the context of the reform of the United Nations and of the multilateral system in general. We are also aware that the handling of human rights issues in various countries sometimes forms part of a long-drawn process. It is not possible to obtain rapid results, and that is why we need diversified approaches, working on different aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall mention three examples, which have been commented on in detail in this House. Firstly, there is Iran. Of course, we could have a policy of confrontation with Iran over human rights issues, but the outcome of such a policy is still extremely uncertain. However, in the general negotiating process – and heaven knows we are discussing highly sensitive and important issues with Iran – human rights have not been left out of the equation. On the contrary, they occupy an important place.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I had the opportunity to meet Iran’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, and we talked about human rights in a very specific way. We clearly called for the reactivation of the group discussing human rights in Iran, and for the resumption of the dialogue with Iran on human rights in the context of the general relations which we wish to establish with that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some hopes that Iran will agree to reactivate that group. For example, Iran has tried to obtain, in exchange, an assurance that there will not be any initiatives within the ECHR. I do not believe that we can agree to that request: a deal is not possible. However, what is important is that we have a dialogue with a country like Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">China was also mentioned. I believe that the human rights dialogue with China is an extremely important aspect of our relations with that country. As recently as this very afternoon, a meeting with China took place in Luxembourg on the subject of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we are not going to modify, change or overthrow the Chinese system from one day to the next. We have a long job ahead of us, but if we look for a moment at the situation in other parts of the world, we can see that this relentless, gradual but constant work on human rights can prove successful and produce results, and there are plenty of examples to demonstrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">The final example I should like to mention is Zimbabwe. It is a very sad and tragic story, and it is not the only one in Africa – there are others. However, in the case of Zimbabwe we have imposed sanctions which I would not describe as too lax, as someone did just now. These are real sanctions. We have even gone so far as to cancel an EU-Africa summit because of Zimbabwe, since we did not want the President of Zimbabwe to take part in that meeting. We do not, therefore, have a weak and accommodating attitude towards that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made Zimbabwe the subject of strict observation as regards the elections which are due to be held there. I do not think that we really have much hope that those elections will follow proper democratic procedures. We shall therefore have to decide how we are going to continue our relations with this important country, and there are other countries in Africa which would be worth mentioning in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus has also been mentioned. We have imposed sanctions on Belarus, a country which has to some extent isolated itself. The question remains of whether, where human rights are concerned, we should isolate a country or seek to keep a minimum of dialogue open, especially in order to help those who are the first victims of restrictions on freedoms and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that Europe is making real, constant, active, but also diversified progress in the area of human rights, and we are not making this area a secondary priority as some people have said. I believe that we want to play an important role and adopt a more global approach towards human rights. Certain more specific rights have been mentioned, particularly in connection with multinational companies. That is why I believe that we should have a more innovative, yet multilateralist, conception of human rights. I believe that Europe should show the way, working with others of course, but we must do so in order to achieve progress in this cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, ladies and gentlemen, this is true at every summit or meeting which we hold with various countries. Thus, on the occasion of the meeting with China in December last, we spoke a great deal about the human rights issue, and we are hopeful that China will ratify the international pact on civil and political rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is also very important that these issues should always be on the agenda at our bilateral meetings too. As Mr Schmit has already said, this does in fact happen. The same is true of our new neighbourhood policy, about which President Yushchenko expressed a certain reticence today. I have to tell you that I do not agree, and I said as much to him in Ukraine. Although the neighbourhood policy we have designed is a gradual policy, it is also a policy which can bring countries together. Ukraine is much closer to the European Union in the area of human rights and also in many other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the Members of the European Parliament for the interest that they have shown. I am also delighted to hear that a delegation of MEPs will be going to Geneva for the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights next month, with the aim of facilitating various contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">The position expressed by Mrs Flautre, to the effect that our dialogue with a country is not incompatible with action within the United Nations, is a position entirely shared by the Commission and the Council. This is why we have always clearly said that we would oppose any motions seeking to prevent a vote on any resolution, and have in fact done so. This is the case with China. The no motion vote forms part of the procedures of the Commission on Human Rights, but sometimes, unfortunately, it prevents us from working together. </p>
<p class="contents"> I wish to continue in English. I have listened with great interest to the comments about the situation of women, journalists and others in several countries. It is very important that the Commission is active on human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that the issue of human rights at the United Nations was also mentioned in the debate today. We must look at the new ideas proposed by the different experts to the UN Panel. There are some very interesting ideas. One concerns the universalisation of membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights or, in the longer term, even the creation of a fully-fledged human rights council. This is a very interesting idea and I feel we should support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is contributing to the internal reflection on all these issues. It is still rather early in the process, as we are waiting for the report by the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, which will be submitted sometime around March. However, I am convinced that the creation of a new human rights council would reinforce the credibility of the UN as regards human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must ensure that any UN reform process promotes respect for human rights, the promotion of humanitarian law, the rule of law and democracy, all of which are at the core of our peace-building response of the United Nations. If we think of Iraq, we know that this is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important that we improve the efficiency of the whole human rights machinery. The first speaker in the debate today, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, mentioned the broad scope of threats we face - for example, terrorism, organised international crime, trafficking, etc. I want to tell him that he is absolutely right that we must tackle these threats. He has our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">I see these threats and the countermeasures to tackle them as a part of the human security concept. This is a comprehensive concept of understanding of individual security, where, importantly, there are hard and soft threats. The idea of freedom from need and freedom from fear are also important and both have to be eliminated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder whether a higher turnover for a few European arms manufacturers should mean that Europe has to give up its values and its ambitions to uphold human rights effectively in the world. I believe that the Council of Ministers will take Parliament’s stance to heart, and that it will abandon its pragmatic approach. I would warn that Europe will otherwise lose its capacity to bring about positive developments in Asia and Africa. What political tools will remain to Europe for the enforcement of human rights and social, ecological and trading standards? Independent organisations have given evidence of the murder, persecution and abduction of ideological opponents in China. This affects not only Falun Gong, but also Christians, Buddhists and others.</p>
<p class="contents">What credit will be due to an EU which breaks embargos, even though the reasons for which they were imposed are still valid? The Union has still not carried out its own investigations into changes in access to human rights in China. Is it also blind to the obvious infringement of rules on international trade and intellectual property?</p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about here is also a safety hazard, after all; I can say this on the basis of my own experiences in the Czech Republic a couple of years ago. Journalists revealed how arms were being exported to Congo, on which Europe had imposed an embargo. This was due to a failure of politicians, who facilitated sales through the unreliable Zimbabwe, with the latter being happy to accept falsified end-user certificates. We should remember that countries in which public control is not working - ...</p>
