<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, this evening I should like to present my latest impressions of the situation in the Middle East in relation to the three aspects I consider to be the most important: the situation on the ground, future security and reconstruction and the political prospects that can be achieved in the forthcoming months, either through an international conference or through some other means. We shall be working ceaselessly throughout May in an attempt to ensure that some type of political initiative that will bring us closer to a definitive peace can be set in motion at the beginning of June.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time I spoke in this House, we were facing various problems, some of them extremely serious, such as the action of the Israeli armed forces in the Palestinian territories and, in particular, in what are known as the ‘A’ zones. Secondly we were facing two specific types of problem to which it was hard to find a solution: the first was the situation of President Arafat, who was confined to the Mukata and the second was the serious and problematic situation of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that today we can say with some satisfaction that these two major problems, which could have brought the entire process to a standstill, have been resolved. The first, that of the Mukata, was resolved following negotiations that began on 24 April with my visit to President Arafat. The solution – as you know – has a European component, because it was finally agreed that the four people who were tried and sentenced for the murder of the Israeli Minister for Tourism would be placed in the custody of a European and North American team in a prison in Palestine. These people are now in Jericho, under the guard of British and US soldiers. The European Union, therefore, did important work in terms of resolving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the second problem, that of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, took longer to resolve. Fortunately, we can also be pleased that it has been resolved, that the Israeli army has left Bethlehem and that – as you saw last night and the night before – a mass was even held by Cardinal Echegaray, the Pope’s representative, who wanted, as a symbolic act, a mass to be held in the Church of the Nativity. Similar events were held for the other denominations sharing the Church.</p>
<p class="contents">How was this matter resolved? As you know, it was not easy, because the State of Israel was demanding that thirteen of the people holed up in the church should be tried and sentenced in Israel having had a fair trial, and refused to consider any other option. A lengthy process of negotiation took place, over long days and nights, with highs and lows, and which finally resulted – as you know – in the decision to move twenty or so people from the West Bank to Gaza and for thirteen people to be taken in by Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The last-minute difficulty was to ensure that no time was lost in distributing these people amongst the various countries. Fortunately, Cyprus, in an act of great solidarity and generosity on the part of its President, allowed them to leave the Church immediately for Cyprus, so that troops could immediately withdraw from the city of Bethlehem. This was made possible, I repeat, by some extremely intense diplomatic activity, lasting whole days and nights and I should very much like to express my gratitude to all those who very directly, on the ground, participated in these negotiations. I am referring both to the Europeans, our fellow citizens who concluded very difficult and important negotiations in situ and to those who worked on the matter from Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pay special tribute to those who were present on the ground, such as Miguel Moratinos, for example, who, in cooperation with the Palestinians and with Israel’s leaders played a very direct role in the negotiations which, as I have stated, were extremely tough.</p>
<p class="contents">This very morning, following the meeting of the General Affairs Council, Coreper is putting together the final touches to ensure that, in accordance with current EU legislation, a solution can be found to the second part of the problem, which is the distribution of the Palestinian citizens now in Cyprus, so that they can be distributed amongst various Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not envisage any problems at the Coreper meeting, which began a short while ago, or with the positions that we have presented for a solution to be found to the problem. Therefore, perhaps the most important message to this Parliament, following our last part-session, during which many of you expressed a degree of frustration with Europe’s role in resolving these two problems, I can assure you and I believe you can all be proud of this, that the European Union has played a major role in resolving these two extremely serious problems: that of the Mukata, to ensure freedom of movement for Mr Arafat and that of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is now almost in the past. The important thing now is for us to focus on the future. What can we do now, in the unfortunately small window of opportunity that now exists, to try to move ahead in the right direction?</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we are working within what is known as the ‘Quartet’, which is made up of the European Union, the United States, the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Russian Federation. Every day we are working on the ground and in the capitals too, almost on a daily basis. To give you an idea, yesterday morning, I met the US Secretary of State, Mr Powell and Mr Ivanov, in Reykjavik in order to continue working on taking the process forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">This month, we intend to work on three separate areas. Firstly, we shall try to reconstitute the security forces in the Palestinian Authority. This will not be easy, but we are going to devote all our efforts to reconstituting and to returning legitimacy to the Palestinian Authority’s security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to do all that we can to ensure that the Palestinian Authority, taking advantage – if I might put it this way – of the disaster it has been through, can be revitalised in a new way, with new impetus and having undergone a reform. We, not only the Quartet, but also the institutions of other countries, such as Canada and Japan, are devoting all our efforts to this process of reforming the Palestinian Authority. We would very much like to come out of this situation with a Palestinian Authority that is reformed, more democratic, and better able to face the challenges of constructing a Palestinian State.</p>
<p class="contents">The clear message that we, together with our friends, have conveyed to President Arafat, is that it is now time seriously to prepare the new Palestinian Authority for the moment of truth, which will come when there is a democratic Palestinian State, which has in place all the economic, police, security and other bodies, with which we would feel comfortable working. These are the three things we are working on.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a word or two about the conference and the opportunity provided by the new political initiative. With regard to the conference, I would say that there is now a sufficiently broad consensus for an international conference to be held, and by this I mean a conference in which the members of the Quartet, that is, the European Union, the United States, the Russian Federation and the Secretary General of the United Nations will, of course, participate as well as the countries of the Arab world that are willing to cooperate in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know a very significant, very important meeting was held on Saturday, once again in Sharm-el-Sheikh, attended by the Egyptian President, Mr Mubarak, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the King of Jordan and the President of Syria. These four held a meeting which, according to the impressions and information that I have received from these individuals themselves was very positive and I would say that, in one way or another, these countries must be actively involved, not only in the conference, but also in its preparations throughout this month. To this end, we are already holding talks with them, practically on a daily basis, with the four presidents and with their teams, to ensure that we work as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the building blocks on which the conference should be based? We should try to achieve a consensus, although this will not be easy. The basis for this conference should essentially be the factors that underpinned the Madrid Conference: peace for the territories and the Security Council resolutions, with which we are all familiar. Perhaps, as something positive and new, we could also add to the achievements of the Madrid Conference and the Oslo process the initiative taken in Beirut by the Arabs, at the initiative of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. In other words, today we have – to use the terminology created in Helsinki – two baskets: that of the bilateral problems that still exist in the regions, such as the relationship between Palestine and Israel and the relationship between Israel and Syria. The second basket consists of reaching a regional formula with all the countries of the region which, in a way that is solid and binding, gives the State of Israel the opportunity to establish permanent peaceful relationships, I repeat, in a way that is contractually binding.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, with these elements I think – or at least I hope – we could have an international conference that could give a new boost to the process. And this new dynamic – in the words of President Arafat, who said this to me this morning in a telephone call – must lead us to move from the debate on security – which must now become a debate of the past, because we need to do whatever we can to ensure that security is not the focus of the debate – to a debate on policy and, now that we are debating policy, all these ideas on the conference on which we are working could be useful. In saying this I am by no means implying that the debate on security is over or that security is now fully guaranteed. This is, unfortunately, not yet the case and, therefore, a great deal of attention and passion will have to be applied to the matter if we are to resolve security relations between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention the debate that has opened up in Israeli society. The debate which has opened up, particularly within the national council of Likud, the majority party, has been responded to by Israeli society. As you have seen in this morning’s opinion polls, 65% to 70% of Israel’s citizens – who do not necessarily belong to any particular party – believe that the only possible solution is the creation of two States. It is true that a majority on Likud’s executive council has rejected this premise, but it is also true that the majority of Israel’s citizens think – as we and as the international community do – that the only solution possible requires two democratic States, with guaranteed and viable borders.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issues of reform, I should like to make a few brief comments, which are still at an embryonic stage but which I wish to share with you, about a long conversation I had on Saturday evening with an envoy from Mr Arafat, who spent more than three hours with me, on the fundamental aspects that President Arafat, or at least the Palestinians, see as possible decisions for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The first idea that I should like to get across to you was expressed by President Arafat this morning in his speech and to me in private by telephone. I would say that President Arafat’s speech this morning, although it has been given a frosty reception by some sources in Israel, is important. It contains a clear commitment to reform and to some fundamental aspects of this. Firstly, security. I believe that President Arafat and the most important people surrounding him are aware that the security forces cannot be dispersed amongst an almost infinite number of people. A State’s security forces must be in the hands of the State’s leaders and cannot be shared out between different factions. What President Arafat needs to do – and he is fully aware of this – is to get as close as possible, in the structures that he must start setting in motion, to what constitutes a State. The Palestinians are today living in a sort of pre-State; their reforms and their political, social and other structures must get gradually closer to those required by a State. Therefore, the security forces, which are still crucial also to giving credibility to the other party involved – Israel – must be steered, little by little, towards a structure similar to those existing in the other countries in the region and, therefore, a much more concentrated and less dispersed structure that the current one, in the occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Palestine must have something that is as close as possible to a government. Unfortunately, President Arafat’s system of government, of management, does not yet sufficiently resemble what we would call a government. I think that gradually, if we are to achieve what we would like to see from the European perspective, which is reconstruction, help in re-establishing legitimacy, rebuilding the security apparatus, and even physically rebuilding structures, when we can be sure that these structures are not going to be destroyed, Palestine must have a government with clear responsibilities and in which the people with whom we are today discussing the economy, security, transport or trade are still present in future. President Arafat has clearly stated – in private and in public – that this is the approach he wishes to follow, in other words, gradually building a system of government.</p>
<p class="contents">A third element that I consider to be very important is democratic legitimacy. President Arafat informed me, at least – I am not sure if this is what he said on the radio this morning – that he is aiming to hold a double set of elections as soon as possible. As soon as possible means in late summer or early autumn. He wants to set a process of legislative elections in motion since, as you know, the legislative Council’s mandate ran out a considerable while ago and, due to circumstances, it has not been possible to renew this and he wishes to see the legislative Council given a new mandate as soon as possible – as well as municipal elections. Changes to the legislative Council and to the municipal Council, particularly if this could be achieved in a reasonable amount of time, would give a boost and a breath of fresh air to democratic life in the Palestinian structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Now this must be a bottom-up process and not a process that is imposed from above. We shall see if we can achieve this, so that it turns out in the best way possible, thereby ensuring that it is a thorough and genuine process, not a superficial one, but one which will ultimately provide us with what we want to see: the possibility of political, social, cultural and other structures, as close as possible to those a State would have. A State is what the Palestinian people want and what we want them to have and, therefore, helping them to put together the structures that will enable them to have a viable, democratic and properly working State, is, without the slightest doubt, the best contribution we could make to the cause of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I was about to conclude but I hope you will allow me to make a very brief comment on our recent visit to the United States. I shall return to the United States on Sunday night and will spend Monday and Tuesday there holding further talks on these matters with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ivanov. I think it is only fair to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, something that you already know: the atmosphere in the United States of America, with regard to the European position on Israel, is not encouraging. There is no shortage of articles in the newspapers – and there have also been intelligent replies by Commissioner Patten – but there is a feeling of incomprehension towards Europe’s positions. And there is a more serious feeling than this, which verges on accusing Europe of anti-Semitism. We must make a major effort in two directions. First, we must be perfectly clear and resolute at times like these when an anti-Semitic act – and I believe that these are not at all common – might occur in Europe. Governments, Parliament and civil society must respond in a way that is crystal clear and forceful. At the same time, we must be understanding and make people see that criticising a government is not the same as criticising ideas that have other agendas and other dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly legitimate to criticise a government when one does not agree with it, on the basis of the legitimacy provided by the friendship that we enjoy with that country. My good friend Shimon Peres issued some very tough and lively statements this morning, criticising the position of the executive Council of the Likud party and said: “Unless we create two States, Israel will no longer match our aspirations. What are our aspirations? These are to have a democratic Israel which is a Jewish State. Unless we have two States, unless the Palestinians have their own State, we would either have to occupy them and, therefore, we would not be democratic, or demographics would mean that we would not be a Jewish State”. If I said this, I would probably be accused of anti-Semitism. I must clearly not be anti-Semitic and nor must Shimon Peres. We must be able to create an atmosphere of tolerance in which mature countries, such as Israel, and the mature countries of the European Union can discuss matters with common sense, to be able to criticise and to give praise when things go well. And this is how things must work between friends.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all I wished to say to you to update you on<span class="italic"> </span>the current situation and so that we do all we can to ensure that this misunderstanding can be resolved as quickly as possible. We Europeans have fought anti-Semitism as a crime against humanity, our fathers fought to prevent it and the sons and daughters of these fathers are ready to continue the fight.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I should like to follow very directly what the High Representative has just said, but note at the outset that once again we are faced with reciprocated terror in the Middle East. Israeli civilians were brutally murdered again last week when a suicide bomber blew himself up in Rishon-Le-Zion. I know we all condemn this wholeheartedly. There is no possible justification for such acts. I am glad that Arab leaders are now publicly condemning these terrible suicide bombings. They must end, and Palestinian leaders must, as we have said repeatedly, do all in their power to control and prevent terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against civilians can never be justified as an expression of political aspirations or frustrations. We continue to demand that the Palestinians should dismantle terrorist networks and end the armed intifada.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no settlement in the Middle East without the creation of a viable Palestinian state and an Israel that can live securely within recognised borders with the assurance that it will not be overwhelmed by returning refugees. We should also be clear that a Palestinian state will require a return to the 1967 borders, or something very close to them, and it cannot be divided up into parcels of land separated by settlements. Without the creation of such a viable Palestinian state and a State of Israel that is recognised by the entire international community, the madness will continue, children will be murdered, blood will flow. Sunday's decision by Likud against the very idea of a Palestinian state – to which the High Representative referred and which has also been condemned by Mr Peres and others – if maintained against the wish of the whole international community, including the United States Administration, would bring us, in the words of the Israeli Labour Party Chairman Benjamin Ben-Eliezer “to an era of continuing confrontation and bloody battles".</p>
<p class="contents">Let me focus for a moment on the Palestinian Authority, as the High Representative did. The Palestinian Administration that rises from the ashes of the old, must be more open, more democratic and more transparent. We have been saying this for a long time and we have actively worked for it together with many Palestinians and the international community. I commend to the House an article in today's <span class="italic">International Herald Tribune</span> by a Palestinian academic now at Cambridge University in which he sets out the case for reform of the Palestinian Authority extremely clearly. We know that reform is difficult. Look at the brave decisions and periods of hardship that the candidate countries and our Balkan neighbours have endured. But reform there must be. I have no doubt that it can be achieved if the Palestinians can be confident that their institution-building efforts will be rewarded with a state and not with destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as Parliament knows, has been funding a project on these reform issues under the chairmanship of Michel Rocard – who is a distinguished Member of this House – and with Henry Siegman as Project Director. That work has already informed the Commission’s efforts to apply strict conditionality to European Union budgetary support. We have been one of the only donors which has attached clear, concrete and tangible conditions to its assistance, obliging the Palestinian Authority to carry out concrete reform measures. For example, firstly, we reinforced transparency in the Palestinian Authority's public finances. Secondly, we helped to consolidate all sources of Palestinian Authority revenue in a single treasury account, which was closely monitored by the International Monetary Fund. Thirdly, we insisted that the Finance Ministry should take full responsibility for managing the Palestinian Authority payroll. We demanded as well a freeze on public sector hiring and a strict ceiling for expenditures under an austerity budget.</p>
<p class="contents">|</p>
<p class="contents">We are already doing a great deal, in other words. But we must redouble those efforts, in order to drive forward a fundamental reform process. I repeat that no one has done more than us in trying to establish reformed, viable and transparent institutions in the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see the rapid establishment of a body responsible for the reform process. We want to see the financial control mechanism strengthened. We want to see Palestinian Authority auditors who are answerable to the legislature. We want more detailed reporting on Palestinian Authority budget execution and public debts. We want the development of a unified pension system covering all public employees and we want the integration of the Palestinian Authority’s donor-funded investment budget into the overall budget for 2003, bringing the investment budget under the direct control of the Ministry of Finance. What the High Representative said is absolutely right: the Palestinian Authority has to look and act more like a government, and that covers not only the ordinary areas of government activity but also the security services in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see a reform of the Palestinian judiciary system. The overdue promulgation of the Law on the Independence of the Judiciary is a condition for further European Union budget support. If this Law is promulgated, we will contribute with technical advice and support for a judicial reform programme helping to instil good governance and respect for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the World Bank, the physical damage caused by Israeli military operations to Palestinian infrastructure and institutions amounts to roughly USD 300 million, increasing emergency needs this year to a total of USD 2 billion. The gap between the support already pledged and estimated needs is now approximately USD 800 million.</p>
<p class="contents">With the rest of the international donor community, including the United States, we are committed to supporting the Palestinian Authority in its reform and reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">A team from the Commission is currently conducting an infrastructure damage assessment, and assessing the institutional capacity of the Palestinian authorities and of the municipalities. This report will guide us in our repair and reconstruction efforts. In the short term we need to work on a quick-start package to get administrative services running again. There is a very simple reason for that: with the destruction of computers, records, payrolls and simple accountancy information, unless we are able to put something very quickly in place, I will not be able to come before this House and say that the money we invest in the future of the people of Palestine is money that is being properly spent. So we need something and something quickly in order to establish the bare bones of decent government in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">In this work we face a serious dilemma. Not just the Palestinians, but the Israelis too, want us to reconstruct infrastructures and institutions which have already been paid for by the international community and destroyed by the Israeli defence forces. How can we be sure that this will not happen again? The answer is that we cannot give that guarantee. However, it is equally the case that I do not believe that we can renege on our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, our resources are stretched to the limit. We are already providing EUR 230 million this year to the Palestinians through the Palestinian Authority, through UNRWA, and in humanitarian assistance. Once the needs assessment is completed, we will come back to inform the House and the Council of the full financial implications and to ask for your help in providing an appropriate European Union response. I want to make this point: reconstruction will not be cheap, and it is not going to be cheap for us to live up to the rhetoric that we have used with passion, eloquence and, I am sure, good intentions. If we are going to live up to what we have promised, it is going to cost money.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few weeks there have been allegations of misuse of European Union monies by the Palestinian Authority. The Israeli Government has prepared a dossier claiming that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority secretly used budgetary support provided by the Arab states, Norway and the European Union to finance supporters of terrorism or even directly to fund acts of terrorism. Similar charges have been made about the CIA – so we are in interesting company. These are extremely serious allegations. We are obviously examining them very thoroughly. So far we have found no new evidence of European Union funds being used for purposes other than those agreed between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority. At this stage, the allegations appear to be groundless – rather like the allegations that were made a short while ago about textbooks. </p>
<p class="contents">This has been reflected in the tone of media reporting. The first headlines in the European and Israeli press were: "EU finances terror". Now the news stories say only that "EU funds may have been misused inadvertently". These allegations should be seen in the context of efforts to delegitimise President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority and to weaken donors’ support at a time when the international community is putting pressure on Israel to engage in serious negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We nevertheless take the Israeli allegations extremely seriously, and as I have said, we shall continue thoroughly to examine any evidence of misuse of European Union funds. Such misuse could not be condoned, any more than we can condone Israel’s destruction of EUR 20 million worth of EU-funded projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We will ask the Palestinian Authority to cooperate fully in clearing up any allegations regarding the use of European Union funds. We need to be confident that funds are properly used. That is my responsibility to this Parliament, and it is both my responsibility and our responsibility to all European Union taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed now is a strong and concerted effort by the international community to reform and rebuild the Palestinian Authority as the legitimate governing body in the Palestinian territories, and as the only valid interlocutor in the forthcoming peace talks, about which the High Representative has spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been so many debates on the Middle East when we have all expressed our horror at the descent into the abyss and our shared approach to political recovery and the building of a durable peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, rather than repeat what has been said so often before, and what is widely reported in the media, I thought it right to focus on a practical role that the European Union can and must play as effectively or even more effectively than any one else in constructing a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">I just hope that we get the chance to rise to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to associate myself wholeheartedly with the remarks the High Representative made at the end of his speech. Any act of anti-Semitism is intolerable, any act of anti-Semitism should be condemned out of hand in democratic pluralist societies, just as any act of racism anywhere should be condemned. But it is not anti-Semitic to find oneself in disagreement with Mr Ariel Sharon, or with Likud Party resolutions, or with some of the things done by an existing government. I am sure that, like other Members of this House, we all want to see a viable, secure Israeli State living in peace with its neighbours. I find it perverse to suggest that it is anti-Semitic to argue that.</p>

There are enormous restrictions on the Palestinian people, military action is persisting, terrorist actions are persisting and, as has been said here, last week another fifteen civilians were murdered and more than fifty were wounded.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take account of the fact that no democratic society can endure weekly terrorist actions without demanding that its leaders act. In addition, on a political level, we have witnessed the regrettable resolution approved by Likud, the importance of which we should not overestimate since luckily it is a minority view within the Knesset and also within Israeli society, as indicated by the opinion polls mentioned by Mr Solana, just as the statements by the leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas do not naturally represent the views of the Palestinian National Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some hopeful signs. The huge demonstration by citizens in Israel calling for an end to the occupation, President Arafat’s statements against terrorist actions, ordering police action and indicating his willingness to accept co-existence with a Jewish State, which coincide with the statements made in Sharm-el-Sheikh by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Libya, and also the end of the confinement of Mr Arafat and the siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, are naturally extremely positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The hand of the European Union is clearly evident in some of these hopeful signals – and we should bear this in mind since we often tend to underestimate our own capacities. The mediation of the European Union is crucial and we must therefore roundly reject the unfair and unfounded accusations that Community contributions are being misused. I am happy with the speedy and thorough explanation by Commissioner Patten, but, as he himself has said, we must be very scrupulous. On previous occasions my group has expressed its concern about the destination of certain aid for education.</p>
<p class="contents">The parties in the conflict recognise that the participation of the international community is essential. We must contribute to consolidating the existence of the Quartet so that it may ensure the staging of an international conference, which of course incorporates the Arab countries, and let there be no doubt that the European Union will play a prominent role in that conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the information presented today by the High Representative gives us hope despite the gravity of the situation. It is true that attacks are still taking place and it is also true that there are still summary executions, but there has been a change over the last month: there is the Mukata Agreement, the issue of the solution to the problem of the Church of the Nativity, and there are other important issues. One of them, which has been mentioned by the High Representative, is the vote in the Likud Congress. We must remember that Mr Netanyahu, who makes Mr Sharon look like a moderate, and Mr Sharon signed the Wye Plantation Agreements as executives of the State of Israel and that brings responsibilities. Something else has happened, and that is the demonstration by more than one hundred thousand people in Tel Aviv asking for immediate peace and, finally, a fact that is not usually mentioned, and that is that the Israeli Government has demobilised the reservists it had called up to punish Gaza, which I believe to be an important shift in approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing as we do that our action, the action of the High Representative and of our representatives in the region, is more effective in terms of its content than in terms of publicity – where the United States are ahead of us – I believe we must encourage them to continue along this road even if they do not appear in the European Parliament. I believe that the absence of Mr Solana on 24 April was fully justified; we have not asked him to explain it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe we agree that we must speed up the creation of a Palestinian State, and I refer to the resolutions which began in 1948, at the time of the creation of the State of Israel. The High Representative said during his last appearance that, surely, on the basis of the Mitchell and Tenet plans, what we had to do was speed up and create a Palestinian State. And as he has said that we must ensure that the Palestinian State – or the Palestinian Authority – increasingly comes to resemble a State, I believe that the process needs to be speeded up, because one of the consequences of what is happening is that the identity and sense of responsibility of the Palestinian people has been strengthened enormously. I therefore believe that we must try to ensure that this process is as quick as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the possible Peace Conference, Mr President, I believe that it must take place under the auspices of the UN – we must never forget that Israel was born as a result of a UN decision. On behalf of my group, I regret that there has been no follow-up to what happened in Jenin and that the International Commission of the United Nations has not been allowed to investigate events; if there has not really been a genocide, I believe that that investigation would even have helped Israel to present and justify its action.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I believe we have to continue working with the Quartet and with the Arab League in order to stage this Conference without excluding anybody. I believe that the Israeli Prime Minister’s insistence that he wants to decide who to negotiate with is completely unacceptable: everybody has to represent themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, with regard to the accusations which have been made in certain sections of the media in the United States and also in the US congress – and we have just approved our resolution on transatlantic relations – branding us as anti-Semites, I would like to refer to the resolution we approved last month which reiterates our condemnation of anti-Jewish attacks in Europe. But I believe we should also tell those sections of the media and congressmen that they should reread the Bible and that both peoples are Semitic, they descend from Shem, son of Noah, and they also have a common ancestor in Abraham; both Arabs and Israelis are therefore Semitic. I am speaking on the basis of one fact, and that is that I feel more Semitic than anything else since, as I said in the Knesset, we Spaniards say that we have traces of Moorish and of Jewish blood. Therefore in reality the anti-Semites are the ones who really want to monopolise this issue. We believe that we have to try to ensure that these two peoples who have been brothers for five thousand years find a solution which allows them to live together, and therefore I believe that to make this type of accusation is not only unjustified, but also it makes absolutely no contribution to the necessary peace process in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I congratulate you on your successes in Reykjavik. As a Swede, I can only deplore the fact that Russia now has greater influence over NATO than does Sweden. That is not, however, what we are here to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">My Israeli and Palestinian friends and those who want peace wonder why we in Europe only talk and do nothing. Of course, we are powerless to stop the violence and bloodshed. Yet the accusation is extremely unfair. I am convinced that the commitment, travelling, money and resources invested by Mr Solana, Mr Patten and all the institutions will have long-term benefits, both in providing a solution to the Church of the Nativity problem and, in the longer term, in bolstering the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, of course, talk violence away, but not many other options are on offer. Negotiation, discussion, dialogue and compromise are the tools we have used to build our European cooperation. I really would like to believe that they might work in the Middle East, too. Violence is no solution. The terrible suicide attacks must cease. Killing innocent people can never be justified. There can be no peace as long as they continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are the Israeli attacks justifiable. They have not put an end to the suicide attacks. The current internal debate in the Likud Party and the potential leadership crisis must not be used as an excuse to kill more innocent Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also deeply tragic that the independent UN investigation into the events in Jenin did not go ahead. If Israel had nothing to hide, then it had an opportunity to show the world that no massacre had taken place. No serious observer has said that there has been a massacre. However, <span class="italic">if</span> injustices have taken place, then they must be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, as Commissioner Patten says, Israel must provide evidence for the very serious accusations that the EU has funded terrorism. It is clear that corruption – on an enormous scale – exists within the Palestinian Authority. We have discussed this on several occasions. Doubtless, some resources have ended up in the wrong pockets, but to say that we are funding terrorism is a very, very serious accusation. I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for taking the matter seriously, and for attempting to find out what is happening and report back to us.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words about the conference. It is good that a conference is to take place. It is good that the international community is involved, but also that the Arab League is to take part. This is not the first conference. There is a certain conference-weariness, but some knots can perhaps be unravelled. The Palestinians must, of course, be allowed to send their representatives. It is unacceptable that Mr Sharon has vetoed the presence of Mr Arafat, since he is their spokesman.</p>
<p class="contents">What should actually be on the agenda, then? Should we try to solve all the issues, or should we just take one step at a time? What should our point of departure be? Those I have spoken to on both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides give different answers: Oslo, Camp David, Mitchell, Taba, the Saudi proposal or the various UN resolutions. There is no agreement here. Yet it is important to try to draw up a common basic agenda. It would be very helpful if Mr Solana could clarify what he realistically believes will be on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We failed to note that the weapons used by the Israeli army are weapons paid for by US taxpayers and that they have been used to destroy buildings and institutions belonging to the Palestinian Authority which are financed by European taxpayers. This is also an established fact of transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the time has come to stop complaining and I agree that we should try to define how far we can move forward. The International Conference must have an aim, namely to prepare the ground so that, before the end of the year, the UN General Assembly can make a formal declaration on establishing a Palestinian State, following the same model used establishing the Israeli State. It is the United Nations, therefore, which is assuming responsibility just as it assumed this responsibility for the Israeli State, which proved to be fair for some and unfair for others. All that has been said regarding the need to help establish a Palestinian Government is based on straightforward common sense, because a State needs a government.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this context, I feel that the statement by the Likud is to be welcomed, for the simple reason that it at last requires Israeli society and the Israeli leaders to shoulder their responsibilities. Israeli political leaders have been saying for years that they support a Palestinian State whilst doing everything they can to thwart it. In this context, I believe that the statement by the Likud will stimulate the debate, because peace, one of the keys to peace, is to be found in Israeli society; the 70% of Israelis who say that they are in favour of the Palestinian State must take political action! This action is urgently needed so that those Palestinians who support the recognition of the Israeli State stop the massacres against Israeli nationals. If we achieve this, the UN declaration will be perfectly acceptable, because it creates a political framework which forces everyone to decide to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like the political representatives of the European Union, who are paid by the European taxpayer, to say firmly to the American and Russian representatives that the problem can be resolved by the UN making a formal declaration on establishing the Palestinian State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For some Members, it was their first visit.</p>
<p class="contents">When one is on the ground and is able to listen to the evidence of the long-suffering populations, to assess the scale of the physical destruction and to guess how deeply the moral scars run, one can gain a better understanding of the meaning of the news that is now coming from the region. One can also grasp the significance of the vast demonstration that took place in Tel Aviv at the end of last week. Once again, ten of thousands of people assembled, which, given the size of the entire population of Israel, is an impressive gathering. They put forward very firm demands relating to conditions that must be met, namely the end of military occupation, of colonisation and of the despicable crimes committed by an army of a country that aspires to be a great democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of April, we met the representatives of most of these movements in Tel Aviv. I feel that their work does Israel great credit. These groups, like the Israeli political leaders taking part in the coalition for peace led by the former Labour minister Mr Beilin, in conjunction with the Palestinian minister Mr Rabbo, embody the hope that things may in future change in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The renewed strength of this current is, without doubt, the manifestation of some more profound changes which are surfacing within a section of Israeli society that seems to have strong misgivings about using the policy of force as a method of promoting Israeli security. There seems to be a greater degree of questioning, especially after the terrible revelations in relation to Jenin, about the consequences of the military offensive against Palestinian towns and camps in terms of Israel’s image around the world, and even about the possibility of international legal proceedings against Israeli leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is great interest in favour of the historic proposal from neighbouring Arab countries to return to good relations with Israel in exchange for a withdrawal from the occupied territories. It is most certainly in response to these signs that the extreme Israeli right wing members are behaving increasingly aggressively in order to reaffirm, in a deliberately provocative manner, their opposition to any prospect of a Palestinian State. This extremely dangerous policy is one that the Likud is stating in its resolutions and one that Sharon is exercising on the ground. His staunch opposition towards the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat, his decision to systematically destroy the infrastructure and assets of the embryonic State established by the Oslo Accords, the construction, according to Peace Now, of 35 new settlements and the organised dividing up of Palestinian territories leave no doubt whatsoever as to the strategy being pursued, unfortunately with complete impunity. It is in this context that the European Union is gambling its credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Fifteen to consider this appeal from a young girl living in the Jenin refugee camp to a visitor who came to express his solidarity. ‘I do not want aid’, she said to him, ‘can you give me justice?’ Justice, of course, means reconstruction but it also means the end of impunity by the occupier and the end of the occupation, respect for international law, recognition of the two States and the guarantee of security of both peoples. This is the clear message that, on behalf of our peoples and the majority of the House, an official delegation made up of Members from Parliament’s highest level, should now take to Israel and Palestine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the EU is now being accused of helping to finance terrorism. That is the explanation for going in and destroying villages and all the Palestinian structures. We must be careful not to fall into the same trap by saying that whoever governs the state must be responsible for security, for it is obvious that Arafat wishes to do all he can to combat terrorism but uncertain whether he can control it. We must therefore take care not to reproach him if the terrorist attacks continue.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to see a Palestinian state established that resembles other democratic structures as closely as possible, I should like to hear what we in the EU intend to do to ensure that the leaders concerned are able to meet each other. In the last year and a half, the Palestinian Authority has not had the opportunity to meet physically. How is it intended to put pressure on Sharon to make that possible? A government that cannot meet will not of course be able to start operating properly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that, in the international conference, we associate ourselves as closely as is humanly possible with the Saudi peace proposal, for it is this that will secure peace for Israel. It will secure recognition for Israel, and that is what Israel has been working towards for very many years. I believe it is absolutely crucial for us to do everything in our power to support that initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have the utmost consideration for the personal problems of its chairman, but I feel that it might have been preferable for the delegation to have met and been able to debate during these extremely difficult and sensitive months for Israel and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative, this House has always condemned the unilateral vision of the majority of the European political groupings, which are unable to distinguish between democratic countries committed to respecting human and civil rights against all odds, and corrupt, despotic regimes. Europe has, to date, been almost unilaterally condemning outright the actions of the Israelis to control and eliminate terrorism while voicing only mild, routine criticism of the actions of the suicide bombers striking in Israel, who were under the same clear, cynical orders as those who struck in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Even with regard to Jenin, High Representative, Commissioner, Europe stirred itself up into a fury and lynched Israel, accusing it of mass slaughter without any actual evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, at last, it is becoming clear that there can be no peace without freedom or democracy. Mr Solana, you have assured us that Europe will continue to call for a more democratic Palestinian Authority which shows greater respect for the rights of the Palestinians. Indeed, we can delete the word ‘greater’. However, this means acknowledging that the principle cause of the tragedy we have witnessed in recent months and years was the denial of freedom and democracy to the Palestinian people and all the other peoples who live in that region under the yoke of tyrannical regimes, satrapies and dictatorships.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not be racist. We must be cautious but it would be wrong to forget that the Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian citizens are entitled to freedom and democracy; we must condemn the fact that it is often precisely those States that foster terrorism which refuse to contemplate the idea of freedom and democracy in their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, when Binyamin Netanyahu wonders what our opinion is on the Likud motion, when he raises the question of the nature of the Palestinian State<span class="bold"> </span>– whether it is a free, democratic State or a State full of unlawful activity and terror which, as a result, breeds terror – he might be asking us, asking you too a valid question.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the launch of an electoral process in Palestine. However, we are mindful of the fact that Yasser Arafat should have been re-elected in 1999 but that no elections were held, and that was before the start of the intifada. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Leila Shahid, the Palestinian representative, Mrs Dayan, Mr Vilan, who are both members of the Knesset, met to remind us, as if it were necessary, that the European Union should, firstly, continue to condemn all forms of terrorism, whatever their origin, and, secondly, should encourage the search for a solution, which they believe involves the implementation of both the Mitchell Plan, which, in my view, has not yet been exhausted, and the Saudi Arabian initiative adopted at Sharm-el-Sheikh.</p>
<p class="contents">The Likud talks that are currently underway do not appear to support the application of either plan. I have before me the initial conclusions adopted two days ago by the European Union’s General Affairs Council. I condemn the fact that the Member States have not yet managed to deliver an opinion on the possibility of the international conference, the urgency and importance of which Mr Solana has just emphasised. In any case, I regret that, the day after Likud announced its position, the Council did not reiterate the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and call for them their application. Lastly, I am concerned that Likud will push ahead regardless, even against the advice of Ariel Sharon, and I would like to know, Mr Solana, taking into account your knowledge of the situation on the ground, how you see the situation in Israel unfolding, were the coalition that is currently in power in Israel to collapse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I include among the positive developments the resolution of the crisis of the Church of the Nativity, although I do feel that we must clarify the status of the 13 Palestinians and the European legal framework for receiving them. I also include among the positive developments President Arafat’s daily statements before the Palestinian Legislative Council and the efforts to bring about reform and relegitimisation of the Palestinian Authority, as well as the launch of the electoral process, the condemnation of the attacks against civilians and the opposition to terrorism. We must, of course, monitor and support this desire for reform. In all this, we agree with Commissioner Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the negative developments I would include the disturbing decision of Likud. We must remember, Mr Galeote Quecedo, that Likud is expressing the position of Israel’s Head of Government here, which is certainly not something to be played down and which, moreover, I am sure is likely to generate more terrorism; terrorism is not on the wane, for Hamas is still voicing its intention to continue with the attacks. In any case, we have become familiar in recent months with the unhealthy relationship between the Israeli right and terrorism, in which each fuels the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like General Morillon, would urge you to express your opinion of the Israeli government now, for it is important that Shimon Peres has made the statements you quoted, Mr Solana, but Shimon Peres must also tell us the position of the government of which he is currently part.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say that the resolution of the incident of the Church of the Nativity should encourage Europe in its role. On that occasion, Europe’s role was that of negotiator. It is therefore apparent that there is a useful role for Europe to play, subject to certain conditions. We therefore call unequivocally on the Council to be more courageous and more consistent in its actions, for Europe does have a genuine role to play and is capable of discharging it successfully.</p>

We met the Israeli and Palestinian political leaders as well as NGOs. Words cannot, of course, express the atrocity of the massacres, but I would prefer to pass on to you the message that they gave to us.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wishes to remain true to the values that it defends, it must urgently demand the withdrawal from the occupied territories and the recognition of Palestinian State, reaffirming the 1967 borders, which requires the breaking up of settlements, the boycotting of products from these settlements and sending an international peacekeeping force to guarantee the protection of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">On Saturday 11 May, more than 70 000 Israeli citizens gathered in Tel Aviv to show their support for peace. This gathering shows us that we need to go further than humanitarian discussions and to start to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament shouldered its responsibilities by adopting resolutions. These are not designed to give it a clear conscience and they must not be forgotten. It is now up to the Council, as it alone can give force and vigour to our resolution, to agree to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European citizens working on the ground form an effective force for peace. They have been a constant presence by willingly forming a human shield. I formally appeal to you to be worthy of these citizens: would the international conference not give us the opportunity to recognise the Palestinian State alongside the Israeli State? This recognition would give confidence to the Palestinians and could set in motion genuine reform of the institutions of the Palestinian Authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The prospect of peace in the Middle East began to fade when the two cornerstones that are equally necessary for a political agreement to be reached were called into question. These are the legitimacy and the security of the Israeli State and the need for the Palestinian people to own a State.</p>
<p class="contents">These two cornerstones have recently been subject to particularly formidable attacks, however. By adopting a strategy of terror in the form of the second uprising, which sees suicide bombers blowing themselves up in order to slaughter civilians, the Palestinians have plumbed new depths in their pursuit of anti-Israeli violence. This violence now serves to take them one step further away from the Palestinian State. The greater part of the majority party in Israel has just declared itself against a Palestinian State, thus undermining one of the bases of a political resolution. We must, on both counts, find a way out of this dead end.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, you spoke – and this is the key to the resumption of the peace process – of the urgent need to reform the Palestinian Authority, which will involve exercising a genuine sense of responsibility and the rejection of terrorism. Only the Palestinian people can take this step, but our aid must be strictly linked to these changes. European taxpayers, Mr President, will no longer agree to continue to provide ambiguous aid to an ambiguous Authority; they will only agree to grant justified aid to an Authority which behaves like a constantly evolving State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, without doubt, because of the unanimity of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, for many weeks now, the International Red Cross, Amnesty International, Médecins sans Frontières, the United Nations agencies, as well as the Israeli and European NGOs that are present on the ground have all been telling us and telling you, Mr Solana, that serious breaches of human rights and humanitarian law have been committed in occupied Palestine and that the conduct of the Israeli army is unacceptable. In a sickening act of vandalism, human excrement was smeared and urine was poured over the shredded files and ransacked offices of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture in Ramallah.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this outbreak of brutalities, the Council has not taken into consideration our resolution of 10 April which calls for the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel. The Council has not yet ordered the embargo on arms exports to Israel, which is a flagrant breach of the 1998 Code of Conduct, in which the Member States banned arms exports to regions in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">What is worse, unlike the President of the Commission, who clearly explained his views on this subject, the Council has not formally protested against the UN Secretary-General’s withdrawal of the investigation team into the Jenin massacre. This is a dark moment in the history of the United Nations, which is unacceptable in law, unacceptable in actual fact. MEPs would have preferred to see their ministers on the front line making Mr Sharon give in to the requirements of international law.</p>

It is true that the 100 000 peace demonstrators in Tel Aviv on 11 May offered the hope of a social reaction to the barbarity of Sharon. The slogan of that demonstration was meaningful enough: "For the sake of Israel’s salvation, we must withdraw from the occupied territories".</p>
<p class="contents">However, other forces of a different kind are working hard to eliminate not just the process, but also the spirit of Oslo. It is true that Netanyahu took it upon himself to create a Likud central committee according to his own wishes before losing power in 1999. Perhaps this puts the recent vote of that body against the creation of a Palestinian States into perspective, but the resolution exists.</p>
<p class="contents">As if that were not enough, Netanyahu has just said: A state, with all the rights of a State [a Palestinian State, that is], is not possible. Not with Arafat; not with any other leader; not today and not tomorrow. Likud has acted just hours after the Heads of State of Egypt, Jordan and Syria – Syria, no less, and I stress this – said literally: we reject all forms of violence; we confirm our desire for a genuine peace with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the Israeli Parliament yesterday agreed that Israel would not reopen political negotiations with the Palestinians until two requirements are met: a complete end to violence – I stress the adjective ‘complete’ – and a thorough reform of the Palestinian administration. Sharon stresses this: there will be no peace with a dictatorial, corrupt and tyrannical regime. There must be another Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">A few hours ago, President Arafat made some excellent comments: accepting external involvement, he told his Parliament that the time has come for changes, reforms and elections and he condemned suicide attacks. Sharon – of course – has just said that Arafat has said nothing new. Since we can expect him soon to invent a new pretext for preventing the creation of a Palestinian State and the onset of peace, I believe that the famous Quartet should take precisely the opposite stance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree completely with what Mr Galeote has said and I believe it is absolutely essential to take advantage of a window of opportunity which is not large but rather small. I believe that all the comments by Parliament’s very worthy representatives have indicated this in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some reasons to be hopeful, but there are still huge reasons to feel frustrated and hopeless. What we have to do is to take advantage of this moment, this window of opportunity – and I believe that is what the international community is trying to do – to make progress. Circumstances like the current ones, which have been pointed out by Mr Patten, many Members, and myself are not going to come about again. Let us therefore get to work. That is what we are trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do everything we can to prevent the peace process being hijacked. We have spent too much time living with the consequences of the great political error of the famous seven days of total peace. That decision of the seven days of total peace, with no doubt whatsoever, delayed the process and prevented decision making. I believe that we should now do everything possible to prevent conduct which could stop us from making a rapid, and parallel, start on work in three directions: security, the new composition of the Palestinian Authority and the new legitimisation of the Palestinian Authority and of the peace process. These three elements – in my judgement – should move forward in parallel and neither one of them should hijack another.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue I wanted to mention – as I have said many times and I repeat today, since I am convinced of it, though I could be mistaken, but I know that even in the European Parliament people can make mistakes – is that I believe we have had a lot of experience of peace processes since the Madrid Conference, including the Oslo Conference until the present time; however, what we have not had, unfortunately, is actual peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the time has come for a short process and a long peace. We have had long peace processes but no peace. The time has come for a short and quick process which brings us as quickly as possible to peace and, from then on, to rebuild the Middle East, a process in which the offers made by the countries of the region can be measured in real terms. What we are offering today are commitments which, for the first time, are of a contractual nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one thing which has not been said and which I would like to repeat. President Arafat said something yesterday on television which he had never said or which, at least, I had never heard: he spoke of the State of Israel as a Jewish State. I believe that President Arafat had never spoken in these terms before. That short phrase of three words contains a very large part of the solution to one of the most difficult problems: the problem of the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore carefully weigh up every word uttered by anybody, and not only one person, because sometimes we find, in certain phrases which we do not analyse in depth, thoughts which may have significant consequences for the solution of the problem and there is no doubt that the problem of the refugees will continue to be a fundamental problem in terms of a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">If you ask me what the most realistic agenda for the Conference should be, I would reply in all honesty that at the moment I do not know. I believe that the agenda must be based on basic principles, that is, peace for territories, the Security Council resolutions and that, as I said before, it should include an essential element which is new: the Beirut Initiative, which does not only also offer a framework for the traditional Madrid lines of negotiation, but also introduces a regional aspect which could be of fundamental use in terms of resolving the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that the Palestinian State must be recognised as soon as possible. I agree, but it must not be before the Palestinians want it to happen. If you came with me to ask Mr Arafat, at this moment, if he would like, this very afternoon, the Palestinian State to be declared, he would certainly reply: "do not be in such a hurry and wait a bit". This is not the moment therefore and we should do things in accordance with the rhythm that the Palestinians themselves want.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinians know that if the Palestinian State were established today, they would not be in a position to operate as effectively as we would like and therefore we must give them the opportunity to prepare themselves adequately and to have the guarantee that the Palestinian State is a State that functions, that is viable and that defends the values which we all, and above all they all, or the majority of them, wish to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to terrorism, I believe that we must continue to say over and over again that it is not possible to achieve peace while there are suicide bombers who do not only kill themselves but who also kill others. We must state and recognise this, both in this House and in any other.</p>
<p class="contents">The other day I said to President Arafat that he needs ‘the best’ – his young people – in order to build a future, and the future will not be built if ‘the best’ are killing and being killed. The best he can do is to convince those young people to support and participate in the construction of a Palestinian State. They will all be necessary. And that teacher of mathematics or that teacher of literature who are killing or being killed would have been essential in order to teach literature in the university when the Palestinian State is functioning or to be a good mathematician. That is what the leaders of Palestine must say clearly to their citizens: you are all necessary! We need all of you in order to build a great country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cohn-Bendit suggested that we allow a year for the creation of a Palestinian State and for the United Nations to declare its existence. I do not want to argue about that timescale: I do not know whether one year is better than nine months or twenty-two months. That is a decision which does not fall to us, but to the Palestinians, but it is true that the sooner it is and the sooner they are ready the better. A resolution by the Security Council of the United Nations would be the most logical and appropriate way to recognise the existence of a State.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poos said some very sensible things and I completely agree with many of them, I would differ slightly in relation to certain others but in general I believe that we are on the same wavelength in terms of the solutions we are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to my good friend, Jacques Poos, that I believe some people here may have been sitting back and doing nothing. The honourable Members are well aware that this speaker has never sat back and done nothing, neither when he was a Minister representing his country – when I was a colleague of yours and we had many opportunities to speak; we must therefore be respectful in the words we use. If you believe that I have been sitting back in relation to this conflict, I think you are wrong and, if you will allow me, I could look back and recall moments when the European Council has been sitting back.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mr Emilio Menéndez del Valle, once again I respect what he says and I appreciate the passion with which he has defended the peace process for a long time, but I believe that we must not be naive – which he is not, but many other are, in general: I believe that the Likud Party will continue to say what it has always said and we cannot expect it to change its position at the moment. We cannot expect the Likud Party to applaud the immediate creation of a Palestinian State. It is not going to do so. However, it is very possible that, very shortly, that party’s position may not be the same as the one expressed by the Council the other day, as our experience over many years suggests.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Menéndez del Valle, who knows the issue well, is well aware of the mark made by Mr Netanyahu when he was Prime Minister, which the previous President of the Government was unable to do. We have therefore seen many changes of position – I will not mention opportunism – over the years and, in the Middle East, we have yet to see many more. The important thing is that the ones we see should lead to a peaceful and just future.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely believe that the European Union is fulfilling its obligations. We cannot solve the problem on our own, but nobody can solve it without us and that is where our strength, and the road we must take, lies.</p>
