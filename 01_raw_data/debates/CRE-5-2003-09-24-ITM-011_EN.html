We also had very high levels of ozone concentrations all over Europe and the two phenomena are unfortunately linked. Ground-level ozone, or photochemical smog as it is also called, is the result of three components: VOCs – volatile organic compounds – NOx – nitrogen oxide – and sunshine.</p>
<p class="contents">Ozone is an aggressive gas which attacks our respiratory systems and damages plants, even at relatively low concentrations. Member States have committed themselves to achieving significant reductions in VOC emissions in 2010 in order to meet the so-called national emissions ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">As requested by Member States, this proposal for a directive targets a group of products which contributes significantly to total VOC emissions in Europe, namely paints and varnishes for buildings and products for vehicle refinishing. Limiting the solvent content in these products is considered to be the only practicable way to help reduce VOC emissions and, consequently, air pollution from this major source.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of clarity, I also want to emphasise what this proposal does not aim to do. The purpose is not to establish or harmonise measures for the protection of the health of workers or human health in general. Although national or Community measures for these purposes obviously have to respect the general requirements under the Treaty, they clearly fall outside the scope of this proposal and are therefore not restricted or modified by this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has the simpler and broader aim of improving the quality of the air we all breathe, by reducing emissions of VOCs, thereby reducing the formation of ozone.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to act now if we want summer sunshine and fine weather to be experienced as sources of pleasure, rather than sources of air pollution and threats to human health and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal can therefore be considered to be one of the measures necessary for the global improvement of the quality of the air which we, ourselves, breathe, and we cannot fail to give this measure our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because we believe firmly in this goal which – as the Commissioner pointed out – has been brought so tragically to our attention this summer, we know that it is in our interest and in the interest of future generations to ensure effective environmental protection. For these reasons, I have taken a very simple line on this report right from the beginning of the legislative process: the achievement of the goal of this directive is closely linked to guaranteeing the quality of the products covered by the directive, in other words paints. The logic is, indeed, very simple. There is a threshold below which the quality of the products available on the market will inevitably fall and, if the quality – not forgetting that, more often than not, these are paints which are used as protective films, particularly against atmospheric agents – drops below an acceptable threshold, the effect will be the opposite to that which we desire. In the medium- and long-terms, there would, indeed, be an increase in the applications of the paint necessary and, therefore, inevitably, an increase in emissions. I have therefore attempted to strike a balance between what it is possible to do technically, without going too far below an acceptable level of quality, and what needs to be done, for precisely the reasons just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now briefly review the key points of the directive. As regards the objective of the directive as such, there were different reactions from the Members, particularly in respect of workers’ health and certain national laws protecting workers. Just this evening, the Commission explained that the goal of the directive is to protect the environment, and to do so without prejudicing or affecting existing measures taken at Community or national level to protect the health of workers, as, moreover, is stated in recital 14.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the Members have retabled amendments to this effect in plenary but, after the Commission’s comments, I reiterate that we must reject this proposal for expansion and vote against the amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 2, 10, 16, 49, 54, 80 and 82. However, I support Amendment No 84, which helps us to define and specify the purpose of the directive more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is an issue of labelling. Personally, I support the Commission’s proposal to entrust the labelling requirements for the products in question to a committee, first and foremost because, in the light of the manifold efforts on the part of industry to provide consumers with clear information, the committee can benefit from looking at existing best practice. I do not feel it would be appropriate to lay down further requirements, and that is why I call upon the House to vote against Amendment No 20.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what is known as the substitution approach, set out in Amendment No 23, I do not believe it is applicable in this context, for the companies and the industrial system we are addressing need facts and certainties – which we are providing in this directive – precisely in order to be able to invest in research and develop the formulas necessary to achieve the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are many amendments relating to the thresholds, in other words the percentages proposed by the Commission and changed by Parliament in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I will not go into them all. These are proposals which take us below the acceptable threshold I mentioned just now and must, therefore, be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to mention other points relating to minor derogations for vehicles and historic buildings, monuments and such like, which the Commission has accepted and which I call upon the House to adopt, and a few amendments relating to the definition of solvents and their boiling points, which I believe are going to be covered in this evening’s debate too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking all my colleagues for their extremely valuable contributions in committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report very sensibly complements the Commission’s proposal in many areas, especially when it comes to the sensitive interfaces between economics, ecology, consumer protection and safety in the work place. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in this case hydrocarbons, have a considerable part to play in the formation of ground-level ozone. Emissions are also formed from components of products containing solvents. In many Member States, health problems in connection with ground-level ozone and smog have increased considerably in recent years. In the case of sensitive population groups, ozone pollution may lead to irritation of the eyes, sore throats and breathing problems. In the environment, account is to be taken of effects upon photosynthesis.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission’s initiative to introduce Community-wide measures for reducing VOC emissions. I consider the product-related approach selected here to be basically sensible. The fact is also to be welcomed that 70% of decorative paints are now water-based. I also expressly support the extension of the directive, agreed to by a significant majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to include dangerous substances in addition to volatile organic compounds present in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products. This approach would combine necessary measures in a single directive and prevent unnecessary bureaucratic expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">If the dangerous substances are, however, incorporated into the directive, it must also still be possible realistically and sustainably to apply the required minimum standards, that is to say the minimum and maximum values. What, then, we are talking about is optimum environmental and consumer protection without, in the process, endangering the competitiveness of our European paint industry, as well as the painting trade that is closely bound up with it. That being said, jobs would also be endangered by the attempt, which goes far beyond the Commission’s proposal, to replace dangerous substances, either fully or to a greater extent, by the year 2010 Europe-wide. That is a threat to the entire paint industry, and first and foremost to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as a severe setback for our European economic area.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to protecting the health of users and consumers, volatile organic solvents and dissolvents should not, however, be replaced by substances that are dangerous to health. Injury to consumers’ health due to problematic new ingredients such as allergens, or long-lasting damage to interiors due to heavily volatile components of decorative paints, must, in any case, be prevented. Environmental and consumer protection have the highest priority. The quality and usability of products ought not, however, to suffer in the process. If the principle of rapid and complete replacement were really to be put into practice, we should have to accept some crucial losses of quality, especially in the cases of paints and varnishes. I personally would not expect either myself or anyone else in the European Union to accept a situation in which the varnish on the door of a private house soon flakes just as quickly as the paints on the wall of the house fade. We need a reduction in solvents and dangerous substances in paints and varnishes, but we need a plan that can be put into practice. It is technically impossible to reduce the proportion of volatile organic solvents to below 300 grams per litre by 2007 and still further by 2010, but it is technically possible and sensible to reduce the proportion of these substances to 400 grams per litre by 2007 and to a permissible maximum value of 300 grams per litre by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, reasonable maximum values need to be applied to limit the side effects caused by the inhalation of paints and varnishes by tradesmen and handymen. The purpose of the directive must be to employ practicable measures in order, in the medium term, to reduce the proportion of paint and varnish solvents in emissions Europe-wide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to say a word of thanks to the rapporteur for his work on the Directive on paint. It is an important environmental directive. Solvents are one of the main causes of ozone formation, and this has serious consequences, first of all for public health: respiratory diseases and breathing problems can be ascribed to emissions of volatile organic compounds. Vegetation and agricultural crops are also damaged. We are right to now impose limits on solvents, and, as far as my group is concerned, those limits could be tightened up further. The study carried out by the Commission reveals that the environmental gain could be increased further by imposing rather more ambitious limit values. For this reason, our group advocates lowering the limit values in line with the study carried out by the Commission. We by no means agree with the view of the rapporteur and the previous speaker that a reduction in solvents would also entail a drop in quality. Experience in a number of countries has shown that Europe can still have beautiful, good-quality colours even with fewer solvents. Precisely because of the imposition of limits, the paint industry has undergone a period of intensive innovation, the end of which is still a long way off. It is my firm opinion that innovation is also the basis of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists also has an objection of principle, however. The Directive on paint does not say a single word about ‘painters’ disease’: as if there were no one working with paint; as if there were not painters clutching a brush day in, day out. Painters’ disease is a disorder of the nervous system. Exposure to solvents can have serious consequences, such as memory loss, loss of concentration and premature dementia. Some countries have taken measures to protect painters against this disease by permitting solvents and promoting sensible use of paint. These measures have produced good results. Not one single Member State should be deprived of this possibility, either now or in the future. The Directive on paint is a harmonisation directive and will without a doubt be a good thing for the industry, which would like to see clear, unambiguous rules in the internal market. Harmonisation must not be at the expense of social achievements, however. This Directive would result in those Member States who wish to pursue their national policies no longer being able to do so, and that is absolutely unacceptable to my group. We have therefore submitted proposals to right this wrong. Let me put it very clearly: if the internal market means that the trade unions are deprived of the right and the opportunity to champion better working conditions, then my group will say ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I find it rather surprising that we have to discuss this here at all. For years now, the European Union has been advocating sustainable development. The point of departure for sustainable development is reconciling economic, environmental and social aspects with each other. Since Johannesburg, the whole world agrees on the necessity of sustainable development and on the necessity of expressing this in the form of tangible policy. Sadly, on this, the first – the best – opportunity of bringing together economics, social objectives and environment, social objectives are not being given their due. I call on the rapporteur, therefore, to have another good look at the various amendments that strengthen the social aspects of the Directive, and to support these. I am joined by a number of fellow Members from various groups in finding this internal market Directive too one-sided by half. The veneer of social varnish is really far too thin to offer genuine protection. Much greater stress should be laid on working conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Two years ago we approved the National Emissions Ceilings Directive and the Ozone in Ambient Air Directive, for which I was rapporteur. The former, in particular, set ambitious and legally binding targets for reductions in pollution and improvements in air quality. Before us now is a measure requiring the paint industry to make changes in its production methods which will help ensure that these targets are met, at least with regard to the reduction in volatile organic compounds – one of the precursors of ozone pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, as far as I am concerned – and I agree with the Commissioner – very definitely a measure that should address primarily the issue of air pollution rather than that of health problems associated with those who use paints.</p>
<p class="contents">MEPs have been lobbied extensively by industry which, for the most part, wants less stringent restrictions on the use of VOCs than are proposed, and by environmentalists who argue the opposite case. I am pleased that in committee we had 110 votes and the Liberal Democrats were on the winning side in 103 of these, striking the balance between the two alternative views. In judging the conflicting amendments- I as a mere politician have in general put my trust in the Commission's air quality experts. I have been criticised by allegedly greener Members for doing this and for not being sufficiently ambitious by supporting the target limits proposed in the Annex. I have worked with the Commission's air quality experts on the ozone matter and I can assure the House that I did not find them unambitious – quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">On reflection, I have decided not to support amendments to raise the boiling point defining VOCs to 280°C, but to stick with the ecolabel standards. However, if the Commission can propose a modification or a derogation that allows the continuation of the rather good B&amp;Q labelling scheme in Britain, I would welcome some proposals along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, some of those environmentalists within the NGOs, who have called in effect for the complete abolition of solvent-based paints within just a couple of years, should go and spend a little time working in industry and return with a more balanced perspective. Environmentally speaking, I want us to move forward quickly but I am conscious that lemmings can move forward quickly and I do not want European industry to have to emulate them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission is right to propose a revision of the existing Directive, which aims to restrict this air pollution. One striking feature of this is that the deadlines for the achievement of the standards are very long. Economic arguments, in particular, seem to have been decisive in this. It became clear during the preparation of this revised Directive that there is a conflict of interests. The trade union movement, especially the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers, has experience of the ‘painters’ disease’ Organic Psycho Syndrome (OPS), which is caused by solvents attacking the central nervous system. For example, in the Netherlands – a small country – where the use of volatile organic compounds has been severely restricted by law since 1 January 2000, a few thousand workers are still suffering from this serious disease contracted in the past. If no new victims emerge there now, it will be thanks to the low limit values that set the standard at a maximum of 100 grams of solvent per litre of paint for a large number of products, and to the compulsory replacement with alternative products. The fear is that harmonised regulations at EU level that are not as strict as those in force in the Netherlands will contribute to a renewed growth in the number of victims in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to stop us from making protection in all the countries of the EU just as good as in the Member State with the most far-reaching measures, so that those who work with paint may stay healthy everywhere? Tightening up the regulations in this way is opposed by the countries that have not yet taken these health-protection measures, and in particular by the industry producing chemical raw materials and the paint industry. The chief concerns of the industry are harmonisation and stability. International companies want to be free of the obligation to take separate measures for each Member State. In their view, the existing rules are not being controlled and complied with as it is, and they use that as an argument for rejecting stricter rules. In addition, they want the standards that are to be complied with to be laid down for many years and not constantly tightened up. In their view, the use of aggressive substances would actually benefit the environment, as these reduce the frequency with which it is necessary to re-paint. They also refer to assurances given by the European Commission and its officials all along that this Directive would exclusively concern emissions into the environment and not the protection of the health and safety of people at work. Following on from my contribution to the consideration by the committee, I am concerned with two matters in plenary, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned firstly with the retention of national protective measures for workers while EU standards are not as strict, and secondly with the improvement of the EU standards now being proposed. In a number of amendments, I propose at least following the standards in the Decopaint study. That study was carried out at the request of the European Commission, but, sadly, was not then incorporated into the proposals. There is still time to correct that mistake now. In addition, we should not wait until 2010 to lower limit values, but do it as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an extremely sound proposal which will entail a considerable improvement where such emissions are concerned. We just heard Commissioner Wallström describe the necessity for improving air quality. Better air also means a better environment, which in turn means better health. The health aspect automatically has a role to play in this connection, then.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mr Lisi for the groundwork he has done. Thank you, too, to my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We had an extremely good vote in the committee, which improved the proposal for a directive. I am, for example, pleased that we adopted an amendment to the effect that paints and varnishes should not contain substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction. As it is, as many as 84 amendments have been tabled in the Chamber, and I myself take responsibility for a number of them. Together with Mr Meijer from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I have, for example, tabled Amendments Nos 62-77, dealing with limit values. We think that the Commission has settled for too low a level when it comes to achieving these reduction targets. According to the Decopaint report, to which the Commission too refers, there are two alternatives. I wonder why the Commission chose to settle for limit values higher than those in both these alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">My Amendments Nos 79 and 81 are based upon the assumption that we shall see a continued trend towards paints with ever lower contents of volatile organic compounds. This directive should also, therefore, be reviewed in 2008 in order for it to be possible to reduce the limit values further.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to mention the issue of the boiling point. I believe that the discussions conducted by the industry in recent days really do not serve their purpose. We think that the definition based upon a boiling point of 280 degrees – and which is also clearly recommended in the Decopaint report – should apply, because it gives consumers a precise definition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I and my colleagues were therefore staggered that the Commission largely disregards the conclusions of that report. Without any statement of reasons, newer, higher limit values are proposed, which are not based on any research. What they <span class="italic">are</span> based on cannot be determined. I should like to hear an explanation of this point from Commissioner Wallström; for it is unacceptable for the Commission to simply brush aside the conclusions of the Decopaint report. I have therefore submitted amendments to rectify this, and shall also be supporting other amendments that have the same objective.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, we are talking here about substances that pose a risk not only to the environment, but also to public health. Exposure to these substances can result in damage to brain functioning and ultimately to disablement. Several Member States have therefore taken legal measures to curb this risk. It is important that this protection continue, including in the new Directive. The current Commission proposal does not provide for that possibility, and should therefore be amended on that point. Surely it cannot be the aim of the Commission to offer less protection to workers than is currently the case. It is extremely important that these measures remain permissible now and in the future. I also support the amendments with this purpose, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to add that this dossier is further proof that the environment and public health are closely related to each other, and that it is therefore sensible for these subjects to be dealt with by the same committee in the coming term, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am quite sure we can carry on with this work and make sure that we have a good result in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to start by congratulating the Commission – yes, I do mean it! When we started to look at this proposal we had to bear in mind that it came out of the original discussions on the control of VOC emissions from some years ago when we first looked at the problem: the emission of VOCs from large industrial plants, from large garages, from large petrol stations and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">At that point we recognised there was a serious problem. Yes, we could take action to control large-point sources – and we did. We asked the Commission to come forward with some proposals to solve the other problem we had identified at that time, which was the hundreds of thousands of small-point sources across the Union in different places, largely associated with the use of paints, but many other issues as well. Sometimes it was small garage paint-shops, sometimes it was domestic use of paint, sometimes it was other substances in other places. I wish to thank and congratulate the Commission. It has actually tackled this issue as we asked it to do. It has brought forward a proposal which is very good, not quite perfect – but nothing ever is – and is taking a proposal from this Parliament seriously and acting on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also recognised that this proposal to reduce VOC emissions is going to have an important effect on the environment. It is going to reduce ground-level ozone. It is going to make sure that we reduce the incidence of asthma caused by ground-level ozone. It is going to cut plant damage. It is going to reduce other environmental effects. It has not been easy to come forward with this proposal. It has disclosed a large number of technical issues that we had not originally foreseen. We thank the Commission for tackling those complex issues we did not at first expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Davies has already mentioned that there are some technical issues that we still have to tackle. We cannot ignore, for example, some of these issues which are still left on the table. I appeal to the Commission to accept the amendments proposed by some of my colleagues on the question of occupational health and the impact upon the health of workers in these circumstances. This is an issue we cannot ignore. We have to go forward with it.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also mention the importance of maintaining a degree of choice and competition in the marketplace for consumers. We should therefore continue to uphold the equal technical criteria for all paints and not give an unfair advantage to water-based paints. Let us have those options available to people. Let the market be free. Let us have some competition. Let us stay inside the equal label criteria we already have.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have to recognise the real difficulties of applying these new proposals in every circumstance and on every application that we find in the vast array of options inside the European Union. I would ask the Commission to think carefully about some of the exceptions we have looked at here: small quantities of paints prepared in traditional ways, often for traditional uses, whether it be for old cars or for buildings. There are many old buildings in Britain. It is a place where we perhaps have too many old buildings which in some cases require specialist, old fashioned, old-style paints to maintain their fabric.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to you to have some respect, not just for the present environment that we live in, not just for public health, but for the old environment, the built environment, the one we are trying to preserve. It would not hurt too much to accept amendments on those questions as well and to give us a rounded proposal we can all be proud of, that we might even get a second-reading agreement on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do it now instead and hope he will forgive me for not doing so earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to return to the question of the purpose and the scope of the proposal. A number of the amendments adopted by Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are motivated by concern for the protection of the health of workers. Some of these amendments – 10, 16 and 26 – aim to emphasise that the present proposal will not restrict or prejudice national or Community measures established in order to protect the health of workers from exposure to solvents in paints and varnishes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the principle underlying these amendments. Measures for the protection of the health of workers fall outside the purpose and scope of this proposal, and the proposal therefore does not prejudice such measures in any way. The Commission also agrees that it may be useful to clarify and emphasise this point directly in one of the paragraphs of the proposal. However, and for exactly the same reason, the Commission cannot agree to include a number of amendments which directly or indirectly aim to enhance the protection of workers' and consumers' health from exposure to solvents in the paints and other products covered by the proposals – Amendments Nos 17, 20 and 23. The Commission finds that these amendments, rather than reducing the risk for human health, might inadvertently serve to create confusion about the scope of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the amendments voted by the committee – Amendments Nos 11, 13, 14, 32, 33 and 34 – contain useful technical clarifications with which the Commission can agree to a greater or lesser degree. As an example let me just mention the proposal that the part of the VOCs in the paint which reacts to form the coating film remaining on the painted surface should not be included when assessing compliance with the VOC content limit value. That is Amendment No 11. This makes sense from an environmental point of view, as it is the part of the VOCs that evaporates into the atmosphere we want to reduce. However, there is a practical sticking point: for the time being we do not have any recognised standard or method for calculating the weight of those VOCs which remain bound in the film. Such a standard has to be developed in order to allow for this deduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also finds it reasonable to accept that Member States, under strict conditions and in limited quantities, may grant derogations for special paints, as you mentioned, for the restoration and maintenance of vintage cars and historic buildings. That concerns Amendments Nos 6, 19 and 22.</p>
<p class="contents">In total, the Commission can, to a greater or lesser degree, accept 20 of the 83 amendments tabled for the vote in plenary tomorrow. Of the remaining 63 amendments, which the Commission cannot accept for different reasons, most are of a fairly technical nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make only a few comments on these amendments and our reasons for rejecting them. Four amendments – 5, 27, 81 and 83 – aim to oblige the Commission to present tighter limit values and/or enlarge the scope of the present values at some later date. Quite apart from the question of principle concerning the Commission's right of initiative, we firmly believe that it would be unwise to guess at what we should do in four or five years in order to improve air quality. When we have the results of the Clean Air For Europe programme in a couple of years, we will be in a much better position to assess if, where and what action might be needed in order to improve air quality in a scientifically and economically justified manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 proposes enlarging the scope of the directive by including VOCs with a boiling point – as several Members have mentioned – up to 280°C rather than the 250°C proposed by the Commission. This is not acceptable to the Commission. Firstly, because organic compounds with a boiling point above 250°C have a very low volatility: it takes several days for them to dry out and they have a very limited ozone formation potential. In other words, they are of little environmental concern. Secondly, because 250°C is the boiling point chosen to define VOCs in the EU eco-labelling scheme. It would be both inconsistent and bizarre to choose a stricter definition for this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Davies, B&amp;Q/Kingfisher will be able to continue to use their labelling scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">No less than 36 amendments – 36 to 53, 55 to 57, 59 to 63, 65, and 67 to 77 – aim to change the limit values proposed by the Commission. The Commission is aware that intense lobbying activities have been going on, both from industry and from environmental organisations, with a view to either softening or tightening the limit values proposed by the Commission. However, so far the Commission has not been presented with convincing evidence that the values of the proposal are not well balanced, economically justified and technically achievable within the deadlines proposed. Therefore the Commission, at this time, finds that it should stand by the limit values, procedures and deadlines proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps you can provide us with a better explanation of how you interpret them as contradicting each other.
