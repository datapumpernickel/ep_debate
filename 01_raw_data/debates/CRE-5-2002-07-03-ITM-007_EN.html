<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Draft law on the media in Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Government plans to adopt a controversial draft law on the media which is contrary to the country's constitution and Turkey's commitments to the EU. EU officials, Member States' diplomats and the Commission's representative in Ankara have already voiced their concerns about the content of the draft law.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft law extends the ban on broadcasting radio and television programmes in the Kurdish language, which Turkey had pledged it would lift at the end of the previous month, thereby jeopardising the fundamental democratic principle of freedom of expression and paving the way for the creation of an uncontrolled monopoly. Does the Council, therefore, consider that adoption of the draft law is politically and legally consistent with the Copenhagen accession criteria and the EU-Turkey customs union? Will the Council intervene to safeguard the democratic rules and human rights enshrined in international law? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might say that Mr Gallagher’s absence from the House and my own presence here are both due to our each having become ministers. That is the way it is sometimes.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the question, I would say that the controversial law on the media to which the honourable Member refers was adopted by the Turkish parliament on 15 May of this year. The Council is of the view that, if it were to be implemented in practice, this law on the media would clearly be a retrograde step and would mean further tightening of the restrictions upon the freedom of radio and television broadcasting in Turkey. The Council would draw attention to the fact that on 13 June, after the matter had been introduced by the Turkish President, Mr Sezer, the Turkish constitutional court suspended five articles of this law, including the article concerning the appointment of members and that concerning economic sanctions in the event of infringements. I would also point out that the constitutional court is still investigating the substance of the rest of the text. The Council would remind the House that the European Commission reacted immediately to this law partly on the grounds that it was not consistent with the politically based Copenhagen criteria and partly on the grounds that it conflicted with the accession partnership, a necessary prerequisite of which is that all legal stipulations prohibiting Turkish citizens from using their mother tongues in TV and radio broadcasts are to be cancelled without delay. The EU has emphasised this precondition quite unambiguously in its discussion meetings with Turkey and did so most recently at the political directors’ meeting on 17 May in Madrid immediately after the Turkish parliament had adopted the law. The Council will monitor the situation carefully, since we are concerned here with absolutely crucial principles. The Council and Mr Papayannakis are therefore agreed on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the last ministerial meeting on 14 May in Reykjavik, the EU and NATO repeated their promise to develop close and transparent links between the two organisations and stated that progress had been made on a number of points concerning the arrangement in relation to NATO support for EU-led operations. They also observed, however, that the decisions made at the NATO Summit in Washington in 1999 and subsequently by the Council of Ministers and the Nice European Council mean that there are a number of points requiring further discussion. As is well known, further progress could not be made because one NATO member had expressed misgivings. What is termed the Ankara text constitutes a non-binding attempt to define guidelines which, at the same time as taking account of these misgivings, can prepare the way for being able as quickly as possible to fulfil the promise of developing close and transparent links between the EU and NATO. In Barcelona, the European Council emphasised how important it is for a permanent arrangement to be reached as soon as possible between the EU and NATO. The Presidency was therefore requested to make relevant high-level contacts, in conjunction with the High Representative, Mr Solana, in order to ensure a positive outcome. The Presidency and the High Representative are doing their utmost to find an acceptable solution for all EU and NATO members, a solution which is, in all respects, in accordance with the decisions made by the Nice European Council and which can facilitate rapid progress towards the goal confirmed in Reykjavik by all the ministers from the EU and NATO countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, between 21 and 22 June of this year in Seville, the European Council expressed its satisfaction with the progress made by the Spanish Presidency in implementing the Nice provisions with regard to involving those European allies which are not EU members. In Seville, the next Presidency – which is to say the Danish Presidency – was, moreover, given the task of furthering this cooperation in conjunction with the Secretary-General, that is to say the High Representative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to ask, if I may, for a few more details on what happens now, following the decisions taken in Seville.

Is there any news since Seville? Do we know how this text is to be improved and what the alternatives are? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to add that, in common with the majority of the Danish parliament, the Danish Government would like to see these derogations removed as soon as possible. Until, however, they are removed following a referendum, we shall respect them. It is a democratic decision we are respecting, and I am pleased that Mr Papayannakis is sympathetic to our doing so. We are, moreover, very pleased that the Greek Government is so helpful and that there has been such splendid cooperation in connection with drawing up the Danish Presidency’s programme, for which Greece has written the section relating to defence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 4 by Olivier Dupuis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0371_EN.html">H-0371/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Georgia</span></p>
<p class="contents">At its fourth meeting, which took place in Tbilisi on 29 and 30 April 2002, the EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee adopted a final document in which (point 14) it ‘calls on the Georgian and EU authorities to fulfil, as soon as possible, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), in order to create the basis for starting negotiations for an Association Agreement’.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council provide a comprehensive list of points of the Cooperation Agreement which have not yet been implemented and the reasons why this is case, together with a statement of strategy and the timetable prepared by the Council so that the Agreement as a whole can be implemented as soon as possible?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, does the Council not consider that the PCA, or even a possible Association Agreement, is not a suitable EU response for Georgia to be able to face the challenges arising out of the region’s extremely problematic situation? Does the Council not consider that the issue of Georgia’s accession to the EU should no longer be evaded, and that therefore, without further delay, Georgia should be included in the list of candidate countries, on the understanding that its membership will depend on its ability to integrate the acquis communautaire into its national legislation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Georgia came into effect on 1 July 1999. It was initially to last for ten years, whereupon it was to be automatically extended each year. The same condition exists in all the partnership and cooperation agreements entered into by the EU. It has therefore always been clear that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Georgia was a long-term commitment for both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">When the purpose of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is considered, it is clear that it has created a solid basis for closer links between the EU and Georgia. It has created a framework for political dialogue that has contributed to the development of the links between us, and it has also helped promote the economic ties between the parties. On the other hand, there is clearly still a long way to go, namely in connection with the need to support Georgia’s efforts to consolidate its democracy and develop its economy. There is also a lot to be done within the fields of legislative, administrative, economic, social, financial, civic, technological and cultural cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, it has been clear that our cooperation under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will take some time. Moreover, Georgia has also had to struggle with some quite special problems. Since 1991, one million people have left Georgia, the gross national product per inhabitant has fallen by 70% and now 60% of the population are living under the poverty threshold. Two unresolved internal conflicts have meant that there are now almost 300 000 displaced persons within the country’s borders. Georgia is in a very difficult situation where regional security is concerned, and the fight against corruption has come up against considerable resistance from various quarters. It is a genuinely tragic situation. We support Georgia’s aspirations to become further integrated into the European models and structures. The EU has provided EUR 350 million by way of aid since independence in 1991 but, in the Council’s view, it would not at this stage be responsible to consider further steps that are subject to agreement. We are convinced that we must concentrate on the full implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. This is also apparent from a recent letter from President Shevardnadze to Mr Solana, in which he talks about the need for further progress in the implementation of this agreement. That depends of course upon political, social and economic reforms, as well as upon the resolution of two internal conflicts for which Georgia itself must assume full responsibility. In that connection, the Council wishes to emphasise that the two internal conflicts in Georgia and the conflict between the other countries in the Southern Caucasus mean that conditions in the area are far from stable. The lack of stability leads to problems involving terrorism, poverty, corruption, weak political institutions, illicit trade, emigration and the risk of ethnic conflicts. Conflict resolution must therefore be our first priority. It demands effort and good will on the part of all the countries in the Southern Caucasus, as well as on the part of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">We cooperate with Georgia in frequent meetings of our Cooperation Council and Cooperation Committee. There are still, however, measures which Georgia itself can take in order to help itself. Failure to implement existing legislation impedes progress and limits the impact of EU aid. The commitment Georgia entered into in October 2000 to adopt a national programme for the implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement has still not been fulfilled. We look forward to progress in this area. Finally, I wish to thank Mr Dupuis for his considerable commitment to this issue. I hope my answer has shown that the Council is monitoring the situation very carefully and that we share Mr Dupuis's regret concerning the situation. We believe we are doing what we can. We are also obliged to ask Georgia to make an effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also concur entirely with what you said and with what Mr Rasmussen told us this morning about the importance of the enlargement process as a means of consigning the division of Europe to history once and for all. We are also aware of the major role that the prospect of accession has played for all the countries of Central Europe in resolving the enormous problems that have faced them and continue to face them.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are proposing is no different to what we have offered and given to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, namely the prospect of accession. A prospect of accession does not mean accession tomorrow, but it is the guarantee of a framework within which Georgia will be able to resolve its problems. We know today that Georgia has no such framework; we know of the pressure exerted by Russia, and we are familiar with the role of Russia in the internal conflicts of which you spoke.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is my question: would your Government, as the incumbent of the presidency of the Union, agree to propose to the Council that it consider the possibility of entering the name of Georgia in the list of applicant countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For certain European countries, the obvious solution is membership; for others, that is completely unrealistic. We must be realistic about the hopes we awaken in the leaders of those countries with which we cooperate.

As it is in this case, the tunnel can, of course, be so long that the hope is too faint and might be said to be in danger of actually distracting Georgia’s attention from the eminently here and now demands upon it that it is not complying with, including certain agreements we have with Georgia. I do not believe that encouraging Georgia to work towards membership would be good advice. The Council must be much more up-front and say: fulfil the existing agreements and solve the immediate problems. As I am well aware, Georgia is, however, a part of Europe, and there is of course a theoretical possibility, which probably cannot be excluded, that Georgia might at some time or another be able to become a member of the EU. That is not, however, something that should play any role at all in the present depressing situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this conference, a declaration was adopted, together with an action programme, confirming the intention of improving the least developed countries’ preferential access to markets, while making progress towards the goal of giving all products from the least developed countries duty-free and quota-free access to the developed countries’ markets. On 26 February of last year, the General Affairs Council adopted its ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative and, during the preparations for the ministerial meeting of the WTO in Doha in November of last year, the EU called upon other developed countries to implement corresponding initiatives and so comply with the multinational undertaking – which is part of the WTO’s action plan, adopted in Singapore in 1996 – to give products from the less developed countries duty-free access. The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has also entreated them to do this. Right now, none of the measures implemented by the large countries are in any way comparable with the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative. New Zealand’s initiative is the one that comes closest to the EU’s example. Canada, Japan and the United States have also made progress, but they are still behind in relation to the initiative taken by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">An investigation recently undertaken by UNCTAD looks at the effects of the proposal. It concludes that the proposal will be to the advantage of all the least developed countries. The advantages would, however, be much greater if the other countries in the quartet of participants in the meeting – Canada, Japan and the United States – were to follow the EU’s example because, at the moment, duty is imposed on half of these countries’ exports in Canada, Japan and the United States. The recent G8 summit in Alberta, Canada, provided a new opportunity to discuss these issues. The summit focused particularly upon Africa, where the majority of these poor countries are situated. The matter is therefore evolving, and we in the European Union can be proud of the fact that we have taken the strongest global initiative in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the conclusions of 27 September 2001, to which Mr Sterckx referred, the Council took note of the Commission’s report on the application of the regulation on the free movement of goods – what is termed the strawberry regulation. The Commission’s report contained, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, a number of proposals for possible changes to the regulation with a view to enlarging its scope and expediting the procedures. The report was not, however, a formal proposal from the Commission on which the Council was to adopt a position. The Council and Parliament were merely called upon to take note of the report. Nonetheless, the Council chose to respond to the Commission’s report by adopting formal conclusions at the ‘internal market’ meeting on the day in question. The Council decided that the Member States and the Commission should closely cooperate in using the regulation in a more dynamic way so that account is taken of the need to protect basic civic rights, including the right or freedom to strike. Even though there was still limited experience of applying the regulation, the Council welcomed some of the Commission’s initiatives designed to facilitate its practical application, for example a handbook on the procedures to be followed if obstacles are placed in the way of the free movement of goods. The Council is still fully committed to protecting the free movement of goods between the Member States. That is a central feature of the internal market. The Council resolution of 7 December 1998, which was adopted at the same time as the regulation, and the conclusions of 27 September 2001 are expressions of this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Sterckx’s question concerning the arrangements made by the Member States for implementing the Council conclusions of 27 September, it has to be said that it is not the Council’s task to monitor what arrangements are made by the Member States in this area. Nor does the Council receive information from the Member States about such arrangements, so I regret to say that I cannot, unfortunately, answer that part of the question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is really about a barrier to the free movement of goods in the Channel Tunnel which, since November of last year, has been working at 40% of its capacity. This is therefore very unfortunate for a number of companies, and is a huge problem for the railways in general, which is, after all, an environmentally-friendly mode of transport. I should therefore like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that, in the Council meetings, the presidency exerts pressure on the Member States so that they make every effort in order to maintain the free movement of goods. </p>
<p class="contents">My question is: what do you, as President, intend to do about this? At the moment, the strawberry regulation is too lightweight and should, in my view, be improved. In response to a question, Mr Bolkestein replies that the Council rejects this way of proceeding. Has Mr Bolkestein perhaps misread the situation? My question is: what can you do about this in practice to ensure that free movement is also guaranteed in the Channel Tunnel?

The Council has debated the effect of fishing for industrial purposes upon the environment on several occasions since then, but it has not at any time adopted a common position on this subject. On 28 May of this year, the Commission submitted a communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy in which it proposed that fishing with a view to producing fishmeal should be targeted at fish for which there is no commercial consumer market and that this type of fishing should continue to be monitored carefully. The Council has not yet debated this communication from the Commission. Council Decision 2000/766/EC applies only to fishmeal feed for ruminants, and then only if the feed fulfils the conditions in the Commission decision. That is what I can offer by way of a reply, and I recognise that it is not particularly satisfactory, but the Council has not yet debated the Commission communication.

Such a system is laid down in the Cuban constitution but has not been put into effect. That is the main reason why Cuba is now the only country in Latin America with which the EU has not entered into a cooperation agreement. Since 1996, the EU’s links with Cuba have been defined by the EU’s common position on Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the common position, the objective of the links with Cuba is to promote the transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human and civic rights, as well as sustainable economic recovery and an improvement in the Cuban population’s standard of living. We believe that a results-oriented dialogue and humanitarian aid are the best means of achieving that objective. The dialogue with Cuba, which was broken off by the Cuban authorities in April 2000, was officially resumed on 1 and 2 December of last year when the EU Troika, consisting of high-ranking officials, travelled to Havana. The Troika met the Cuban delegation led by foreign minister Felipe Perez Roque. Its experts also met experts from the Cuban delegation when the UN Commission on Human Rights held a meeting in April of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 17 June of this year in Luxembourg, the General Affairs Council approved the eleventh review of the EU’s common position on Cuba. The Council again confirmed that the objectives are still valid. The Council thought it was important to continue the dialogue with Cuba so that practical results might be achieved, and it also let it be known that it is awaiting clear signals from the Cuban Government that the latter is fulfilling the objectives laid down in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 May of this year, when the Varela Project was presented to Cuba’s National Assembly, the Presidency submitted a declaration on behalf of the European Union in which it welcomed the Varela initiative. We believe that the Varela Project is an important initiative which, with the strong support of Cuban civil society, can pave the way for the changes which the country needs and which Cuban society is calling for. The purpose of the initiative, which is warranted by the Cuban constitution, is to introduce a system of civic and other rights which are laid down in the constitution itself but which have not been put into effect. In the declaration, the EU expresses the hope that the National Assembly will adopt the initiative being considered and that the Varela Project will be the jumping-off point for a debate that will be able to promote a peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy and a Cuban society at peace with itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council took note of this eleventh review of the EU’s common position on Cuba at the meeting on 17 June in Luxembourg. It was confirmed that the common position continues to form the basis of the EU’s policy towards Cuba, and it was noted that this policy still applies. The Council observed certain positive signs, such as greater religious freedom, fewer political prisoners, no use of the death penalty for the last two and a half years and the ratification of several UN instruments concerning human rights. It observed that there have recently been signs of greater openness on the part of the Cuban authorities. This was seen as a start, and the Cuban Government was expected to take positive steps that could lead to practical reforms in preparation for a political system based on democratic values. In that connection, the Council is following with interest developments in the project referred to, which is warranted by the constitution. The Council is calling upon the Cuban Government to regard it as a legitimate initiative, since it represents a significant effort to introduce the reforms in question. The conclusion, therefore, is that the Council should give maximum attention to Cuba, follow developments there and persist in making demands upon the country but, at the same time, note the modest forms of progress which have taken place in spite of everything and which the Council hopes may lead to more such progress in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a pleasure to see you. I thank you very much for your reply and I would like to point out that new events have taken place since I submitted my question. Tomorrow, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is holding a seminar on the democratisation of Cuba. We had invited four Cuban citizens to take part in the meeting, but they were refused exit visas by the Cuban authorities. A quarter of an hour ago, I received a fax from the Cuban Ambassador, stating that the seminar was an affront to the people of Cuba. As you know, the Cuban regime has also pushed through an amendment to the constitution which gives Socialism a permanent place in the constitution. What is happening in Cuba is naturally an extreme provocation for the Communist regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether the Danish Presidency is preparing to bring further pressure to bear now that so many different initiatives in favour of democratisation are to be seen. The tentative improvements we saw appear not to be leading anywhere. The EU has a vital role to play in this matter, and the Cuban opposition desperately needs us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My answer is that it sounds like an exciting and positive initiative. What it has shown, unfortunately, is that there is still a long way to go before quite basic human rights are respected in Cuba. That must not cause us to give up, and I am pleased to have received the information provided by Mrs Malmström in this House. It is instructive, and we must of course take it into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will not happen again. In fact, I am used to people putting the wrong emphasis on my own name.</p>
<p class="contents">I think my choice of words was very well balanced. I agree that the presence of both a father and a mother normally offers the best basis for bringing up a child, but it is not, of course, always the case that matters work out so well. On the other hand, there are children who grow up without either a father or mother but who can nonetheless have a happy childhood and a good life, and I therefore think it important for us not to have too narrow a definition of the concept of the family.</p>
<p class="contents">The demographic challenge constituted by the falling population can be discussed at length. I do not believe that the problem is as dramatic as some people make out, but it is not my task, here on behalf of the Council, to adopt a position on the ongoing discussion I think we should have concerning this issue. We are also concerned here with the issue of immigration in our countries, and I think it would be too much of a digression to begin a discussion on that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In spite of the president’s assurances that human rights are respected, the EU has expressed its concern about procedural irregularities during the court case, as well as about the allegations of torture and maltreatment suffered by the accused. There continue to be serious doubts about the legality of the detentions.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday 10 June, straight after the judgments had been pronounced, the Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the EU in which it appealed to the relevant authorities in Equatorial Guinea to make the necessary arrangements to have the judgements quashed in order to ensure that the basic rights of the accused were respected. In the EU’s view, the evidence against the accused politicians is flimsy, in sharp contrast to the severity of the judgments. Hence, our demand that the cases be re-examined.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU expressed serious doubts about the authorities’ willingness to defend the principle of the Rule of Law and to fulfil its human rights obligations, recently entered into in connection with the 58th meeting of the UN’s Commission on Human Rights. The EU also referred to Equatorial Guinea’s obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment – the convention recently signed by Equatorial Guinea. The EU has therefore been prompt, consistent and firm and, as can be seen, it has a considerable lack of confidence in the court decisions in Equatorial Guinea to which I have referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would call attention to a resolution on energy efficiency in the European Community, adopted in 1998, as well as to the conclusions adopted by the Council on, respectively, 30 May 2000 and 5 December 2000 in response to the Commission’s action plan for energy efficiency, calling for special arrangements in the construction sector. The Council has also recognised the importance of energy efficiency in the conclusions adopted on 10 October 2000 on common and coordinated policies and arrangements in the EU for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, designed to help achieve the objectives of the European Climate Change Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific arrangements proposed in the action plan are concerned, the Commission has since presented the Council with a proposal for a directive on the energy efficiency of buildings. On the basis of Parliament’s statement, the Council submitted its common position to Parliament in advance of last month’s part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second question, it must be remembered that matters such as the EU institutions’ seats are regulated by the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, the ECSC Treaty and the Euratom Treaty, on the location of the seats of the institutions and of certain bodies and departments of the European Communities and of Europol. This protocol may only be amended in accordance with the procedure described in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union. The issue must therefore be raised in another forum, as I believe Mr Newton Dunn will fully agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like <span class="italic">UNAMA</span> and other international observers, the Council is generally satisfied with the outcome of the extraordinary meeting held in Kabul in the middle of June. In general, the <span class="italic">Loya Jirga</span> process has successfully fulfilled the objectives set in the Bonn Agreement, that is to say of choosing a Head of State and approving the structure of the transitional administration, together with its key personalities. The most important political forces in the country have supported this <span class="italic">Loya Jirga</span>, and there has been unusually strong popular support throughout the process. This <span class="italic">Loya Jirga </span>was apparently the most representative the country has ever had. It had a good ethnic balance and there was a significant number of women among the delegates. That is a noteworthy achievement in view of the difficult political and security environment and the tight timetable, a partially displaced population and the lack of reliable infrastructure and statistics. The Council is, however, also clear about the difficulties and problems there have been in the period leading up to the <span class="italic">Loya Jirga.</span> In a number of cases, the election of delegates was disrupted by organisational problems and also by attempts to harass, bribe, intimidate or kill candidates. That being said, these episodes were rare and did not alter the structure and timetable of the process. Nor were they able to undermine its legitimacy. The Council remains convinced that the extraordinary meeting has paved the way for further reconciliation between the various ethnic groups and for its now being possible to create a stable political structure, something which is essential for the further reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the Council would once again emphasise that the reconstruction aid from the EU, pledged in Tokyo, is still conditional upon all the Afghan parties’ making a positive contribution to the process and the objectives established in the Bonn Agreement. With regard to further stabilisation of the country, the EU has confirmed many times since the beginning of the Bonn process that it is firmly resolved to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan. In the future too, the Member States will supply most of the ISAF forces in Kabul. The Community and the Member States will continue to supply the reconstruction aid pledged at the international donor conference held in Tokyo in January of this year. The Community and the Member States have pledged to donate EUR 600 million in this year alone, and EUR 2.3 billion in the subsequent years up until 2006. As one of the four leaders of the steering group for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, the EU will continue to play an active role in the country’s reconstruction. The EU will also go on providing the much needed humanitarian aid and will therefore continue to be by far the largest donor of aid to Afghanistan. I might add that it was stated in the declaration in Seville that repatriation aid will be provided to Afghanistan, as requested by the UNHCR.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, a good many projects designed rapidly to take effect have been implemented on the spot, and ever more medium and long-term reconstruction and development projects are in the process of getting under way. The EU will continue to be heavily involved in the necessary reform of the security sector, where a number of Member States will continue to play a leading role in the training of the army, border guards, police forces, anti-drugs squads and so on. High-level visits by quite a few EU delegations have deepened political contacts with the Afghan leaders, and these contacts will continue. Last but not least, they will also form a sound basis for a continued dialogue on matters of substance with the Afghan authorities. They will also increase the visibility of the EU and raise its profile in the country, as well as help channel future EU aid to Afghanistan. That is why it is important for the EU to have a special representative in Kabul, for the Member States to open embassies there and for the Commission to open a representation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think we should focus on two points, and would therefore like to ask you this.

With regard to Mr Posselt’s observation that the <span class="italic">Loya Jirga</span> has deeply offended the Pashtuns, I would go on to say that nothing is perfect and that I did not maintain that the <span class="italic">Loya Jirga</span> is the expression of a perfect democracy. Nor have I heard the European media say that. In view, however, of the mediaeval nature of what preceded this, it is rather impressive and, in any case, promising in terms of the future, that things have, in spite of everything, progressed as far as they have. The fact that Czech social democracy is apparently not perfect, either, might be considered comforting in the circumstances. I do not know whether the two situations have very much in common with each other, but I shall leave it entirely to Mr Posselt, who has a better understanding of the Czech Republic than I do, to decide about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What immediate steps does the Council intend to take to ensure that Turkey shows due respect for the fundamental rights of the Kurdish people in accordance with the large number of international instruments dealing with human rights and the rights of peoples?

<p class="contents">Since 2 May 2002, the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) has been regarded throughout the European Union as a terrorist organisation. However, by its own admission, the PKK abandoned its armed struggle against the Turkish army when it declared a cease-fire in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In April 2002, the PKK was dissolved. In that same month, the Congress for Freedom and Democracy in Kurdistan (KADEK) was founded. By its own admission, KADEK is seeking a solution to the Kurdish question through peaceful, democratic and political means.</p>

<p class="contents">The inclusion of the now dissolved PKK on the official list of terrorist organisations is not helping the peace process in Turkey and serves only to increase the oppression of the Kurdish population by the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Council clarify on what criteria they based the decision to include the PKK on the list of 2 May 2002, bearing in mind that this organisation dissolved itself in April 2002?</p>

The Council would like to emphasise that reviews are regularly carried out of the list of groups and entities included in the annex to the Council’s common position on the application of specific arrangements for combating terrorism. The recent review led to the PKK’s being added to the list. This happened following a careful assessment on the basis of the provisions in Article 1 of the common position I have just mentioned. The Council does not share the view that inclusion of the PKK on the list will lead to increased oppression of the Kurdish population of Turkey. Attention should be paid to the recent recommendation by Turkey’s National Security Council that the state of emergency which still applies in four predominantly Kurdish provinces in the south-eastern part of the country be lifted. The Council is fully aware that there are still significant and regrettable restrictions upon basic freedoms, human rights and, especially, cultural rights, particularly in those areas in which the state of emergency is still in force. These circumstances are naturally covered by the political Copenhagen criteria, and it goes without saying that accession negotiations cannot be initiated until these criteria have been fulfilled to the letter. The EU uses all the political discussion meetings with Turkey to press for further progress in terms of democratic reforms. It is made clear on these occasions that human rights and principles of the Rule of Law must be fully observed in the fight against terrorism and that the latter may in no way be used as an excuse for introducing or maintaining restrictions upon these rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absurd to have included the PKK on the list of terrorists, particularly in view of these recent events that I have mentioned, and this will encourage Turkey to be even more cruel towards the Kurds; it will prevent any further peace agreement and will exacerbate the situation. I must emphasise the fact that the PKK was included on this list at the moment when it had unilaterally started to respect the human rights of the Turkish people far more than Turkey itself. I therefore believe that the Council should reconsider its decision and remove the PKK from the terrorist list, particularly because its members are no longer terrorists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This action has not been taken by accident. Consideration has been given to it. It can, of course, always be hoped that there will be developments as a result of which it will be possible at some time or another to remove the PKK from the list. Now, however, that the PKK <span class="italic">is</span> on the list, it is not without reason. The matter has been carefully investigated. There is no question of a subjective decision’s having been made. It is objective criteria that have formed the basis for the decision. Precisely because they are objective criteria, however, it might of course subsequently be possible to remove the PKK from the list on the basis of the same objective criteria. Finally, I should like to contest or contradict the reasoning according to which Turkey will now engage in worse behaviour – or whatever one wishes to call it – towards the Kurds in Turkey. There is nothing to suggest that it will. In my answer, I gave an example of events in actual fact taking the opposite course.

<p class="contents">As regards the other point, I would like to point out once again that if we are going to discuss the list of terrorist organisations, we should look at the situation from the Kurdish perspective as well. More than four thousand Kurdish villages have been completely destroyed. Who will take action here and protect the Kurdish people? Surely terrorists are at work here too? Or let's take the case of Leyla Zana. The European Parliament honoured Leyla Zana with its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. She was sentenced to imprisonment in Turkey for supporting the PKK. According to the new list published in Turkey, Leyla Zana is a terrorist. The question is this: what terrorist act did Leyla Zana, a Member of the Turkish Parliament, commit to warrant her being classed as a terrorist? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I perfectly understand Mrs Maes’s being able to cite Northern Ireland and other places where compromises have ended up being made with former terrorist organisations. We must hope that this can also happen in the future, for it is often the way in which terrorist organisations can stop being terrorist organisations. In the light, however, of what has happened and of the threat clearly facing our countries, the international community has reached a broad agreement about the need to take action against possible terrorist organisations. Hence, these criteria and this list. I find it hard to see what else could be done, and it does not of course exclude the possibility of former PKK members’ being able to play a role in a future arrangement designed to secure the rights for which Kurdish organisations have fought and of which I have as great an appreciation, I believe, as Mrs Maes.

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 25 by Konstantinos Alyssandrakis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0420_EN.html">H-0420/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Attempt to criminalise political beliefs in Slovakia</span></p>
<p class="contents">A proposal has been tabled in Slovakia's parliament to amend the Criminal Code (Law 140/1961), to make provision for prison sentences for anyone expressing sympathy with communist ideas. This attempt to criminalise political activity is being made with a view to the parliamentary elections in September 2002, at which it is forecast that the Communist Party of Slovakia could reach the 5% threshold required to obtain parliamentary representation. The aim is to terrorise voters and to criminalise their political views, by providing the sanction of a prison term ranging from six months to three years for anyone expressing merely 'sympathy for communism' or 'doubt regarding its crimes', and thus to prevent citizens from expressing themselves democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council condemn this unacceptable and deeply undemocratic move, and does it intend to approach the Slovakian authorities to ensure that moves of this kind do not have any effect, at the very least in a country which is on the threshold of membership of the EU?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was decided that these criteria should be met before accession negotiations could be begun. The negotiations with Slovakia were not, therefore, begun until the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999 was able to state that the criteria had now been met. In its 2001 report on the future of Slovakia, the Commission concluded that the country continued to fulfil the political Copenhagen criteria. The Commission also observed that, since 1999, Slovakia had done a lot in order further to consolidate and firmly establish the stability of its institutions and so strengthen democracy, the Rule of Law and human rights. With regard to the specific question raised by the honourable Member, the bill in question is, according to what we have been told, being debated right now by the Slovakian parliament. The second reading, which should have taken place in the middle of June, may possibly be deferred because there are a lot of other bills to be debated. The Council is not at the present time able to assess the content of this bill. It would be inappropriate for the EU to interfere in the democratic process in a third country. If the bill is adopted, the EU will no doubt adopt a position on the content and, should it prove that the fundamental democratic principles, and particularly the Copenhagen criteria, have been violated, the EU will of course not hesitate to raise the issue at every available opportunity, and specifically in those bodies set up under the terms of the Europe Agreement. The Council is therefore carefully monitoring developments in relation to the bill in question and is awaiting more detailed information about the debate in Slovakia’s legislative assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bill in question has already affected political life in Slovakia, especially in the run up to the elections due to be held in September, in which the Communist party is expected to exceed the 5% threshold and obtain seats in parliament. Unless, of course, the Council is comfortable with this and does not consider that a bill which criminalizes political beliefs and threatens anything from six months to three years in prison for anyone who even expresses sympathy with the Communists or doubts their crimes to be an infringement of human rights. What I should like to know is, does the Council see this sort of threat, this sort of criminalisation, as falling inside or outside respect for rudimentary political rights? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They constitute the preventive tool called for by this House. I have said – and this has been stated at every opportunity – that these criteria must be observed by every country which wishes to become a member of the European Union. It is still only a question of a bill, and one submitted in a third country. It must be up to the European Union to assess the situation if the bill is adopted with or without amendments. In that way, it will be determined whether it is in conflict with the Copenhagen criteria. I do not wish, on behalf of the Council, to pronounce any judgment here in this House today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
