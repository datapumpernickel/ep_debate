The Commission continues to attach the greatest importance to all measures aimed at ensuring better protection of workers’ health and safety, for these are factors essential to the quality of life in the work place.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest scientific data indicates that excessive exposure to optical radiation, whether the sources be natural or artificial, may have serious consequences for health, particularly for the health of workers exposed to it in the course of their professional activities. Given that the harm caused by exposure to optical radiation does not depend upon whether the source of that radiation is artificial or natural, the proposal includes all cases of professional exposure to optical radiation. Nonetheless, the Commission has accepted the approach adopted in the Council common position, which consists of introducing differential treatment to reduce the risks arising from exposure to natural sources such as the sun or to artificial sources such as lasers or ultraviolet lamps.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding exposure to artificial sources, the proposal lays down exposure limit values and provides for a series of preventative measures, including risk assessment carried out in advance with a view to removing the risks or reducing them to a minimum. To avoid placing pointless burdens upon companies, the proposal also points out that the assessment may take account of data provided by the manufacturers of equipment that produces optical radiation when such equipment is covered by a relevant Community directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding exposure to natural sources whose presence and intensity are beyond man’s control, it has not been deemed appropriate to apply exposure limit values. In this case, the directive nonetheless emphasises the importance of informing and training workers, as well as of carrying out a prior assessment of the risks, taking account of simple protective measures adapted to the situation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall shortly have the opportunity to state the Commission’s position on the amendments, but I need to let the debate take place. I would also point out that I am dealing with this matter in the absence of Mr Špidla, who has gone to the EU-China Summit. I am well placed to deputise for my colleague, all the more so because the subject is that of working conditions, on which I myself have had plenty of opportunities to work. I would thank Parliament in anticipation of its letting us have all the information and observations available to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This obligation is set out, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, in Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome. A ‘framework directive’ of the European Economic Community, adopted in 1989, constitutes the basis of the legal environment. The provisions of this directive stipulate that, in order to ensure workers’ health and safety, employers have a general obligation to evaluate all possible risks that could have an adverse effect on workers’ health while carrying out their occupational activities. The framework directive, then, sets out this general obligation to ensure that workers can be protected from all adverse effects. Specific types of risks are not listed in this prescriptive text, because the range of risks constantly changes and expands depending on changes in the occupational environment. The employer, however, must be attentive to all risks, regardless of this.</p>
<p class="contents">As far back as 1989, the legislators already intended drafting appropriate legal provisions, tailor-made to fit the different risks, and this was the reason why a specific piece of legislation was drawn up concerning physical risks. Following its first reading in 1992, Parliament decided to divide it into four parts, thus giving rise to the different risk-related directives on noise, vibrations and electromagnetic fields. The last component, on optical radiation, is now on the agenda for its second reading. On issues relating to radiation from artificial sources, a fairly broad consensus was achieved in the course of Parliament’s work and the conciliation process that took place with representatives of the Commission and the Council. On the other hand, the question of solar radiation, in other words radiation from natural sources, proved controversial, so I would like to say a few words about it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fundamental principle that the employer is responsible for any harm arising to an employee from occupational activities. This is incontrovertible, and the earlier legislative provisions still in force today clearly stipulate this. Obviously, a distinction must be drawn between different countries, different circumstances and even in terms of radiation, and therefore a great deal of detailed and complicated consultation was necessary before we were able to arrive at a compromise with the majority of our fellow Members. The essence of this compromise is that, on account of the extremely varied circumstances prevailing in relation to solar radiation, it would make sense for detailed provisions and specific measures to be elaborated at the level of the Member States. In the spirit of subsidiarity, this compromise proposes that, in the case of radiation from natural sources, the task of setting out appropriate provisions should be the competence of the individual countries. It is obvious that the situation is very different in Sweden and in Greece, in Spain and in Germany. The traditions are different; the culture is different. It therefore makes sense to give individual countries the opportunity to define the obligations that employers will be expected to meet. At the same time, however, I also consider it an important achievement that broad agreement was reached on numerous issues relating to the report; for example, the Council indicated that it was willing to accept the proposal supported by all political groups in Parliament: to draw up a practical technical guide, which we are now awaiting from the Commission. This would help businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to understand, apply and simply to manage the often quite complex actions they must undertake, especially as regards radiation from artificial sources. It would be a great result if this guide were also part of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask my colleagues and Parliament to support the version of the directive, and those proposed amendments to it, that create a balance between European-level provisions laying down minimum obligations and the practical possibilities and responsibilities of the Member States. I therefore ask you to support these compromises. Lastly, I would like to thank the ‘shadow rapporteurs’ of all the political groups, my colleagues and the representatives of the Council and the Commission. We have worked very hard in recent weeks, and I think we have worked well together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have less appreciation for the Council and Commission representatives. I regret that you, Mr Barrot, are unable at the start of the debate to indicate the Commission’s position on this issue and that you are unable to say whether the Commission is prepared to defend the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Moreover, I do not appreciate the fact that the Council representatives have so far not been in contact, particularly because the politicians in the Member States say that we should actually take a different course in Europe, while the Commission’s bureaucrats who pore over this topic say that we must remain faithful to what we have.</p>
<p class="contents">That goes against the grain with me. What we have done is to take a decision about a first reading that dates back to 1992 – that is 13 years ago – and we have not reached second reading until now! A great deal has been written about this topic. As far as artificial radiation is concerned, we have to be strict when it comes to working conditions; after all, workers’ health is at stake. As for solar, or natural, radiation, we would like to take a different approach, which can be done by means of the subsidiarity clauses that we have at our disposal. The sun shines for varying lengths of time and with varying intensity from one location to another. We therefore consider minimum unit requirements in Europe to be taking matters too far.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ response to our amendments has been very positive. I believe that the report that is now before us will receive broad support in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we intend to tackle natural radiation? We admit that there is a danger, but Member States, along with employers in conjunction with the Member States, should decide for themselves whether, and when, measures should be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">This principle has been incorporated in the approved report and I would make an urgent appeal to all groups, including the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to give this report their backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He worked very closely with all the shadow rapporteurs, improved an already pretty good common position and produced a good draft report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. It is only a pity that that good work was put in jeopardy by the stance taken by his own group, the PPE-DE, and a faction in the Liberal Group on one aspect of the proposal: the provisions relating to the occupational risks arising from exposure to natural radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we have come to expect totally misleading and sensational press releases from the right, misrepresenting important pieces of health and safety legislation. When we worked on the issue of industrial noise, we were accused of trying to ban bagpipe playing in Scotland. Our work on the risks of whole body vibration was evidently to stop farmers from driving tractors after only three or four hours, even at the height of the harvest. Now our work on this proposal is presented as an attempt to force citizens to carry umbrellas. This is absolute nonsense. The Commissioner himself said that the original proposal envisaged a far lighter-touch approach to natural radiation than artificial sources.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this time I sense something more than an attempt to grab cheap tabloid headlines, something more ideologically driven. I believe that those sitting behind Mr Őry and trying to undermine his work think that, with the stalling of much of Europe's social agenda, they have a chance to push for deregulation and the renationalisation of important elements of the social legal base. If that is so, then let me tell them that they should think again. We will do all we can to stop them in their tracks and continue to improve, and not undermine, worker protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, our amendments on natural radiation have nothing to do with the ridiculous stories fed to the media. We are trying to do three positive things. First, to make explicit what is already implicit in the proposal. We are not talking about expensive duties being imposed on employers. Where the employer finds a risk associated with natural radiation, information will be provided to workers. In the vast majority of modern occupational settings there will be no risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, by taking the sentence from the Council, granting Member States a role in determining the criteria to apply to the risk assessment in the light of national circumstances, we are acknowledging the obvious fact that, as both speakers have already said, the risk from natural radiation is somewhat lower in Newcastle than it is in Naples.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are trying to provide greater legal certainty for employers. Although the right try to deny it, the 1999 Framework Directive clearly imposes a duty on employers to assess all occupational risks. The 1992 directive on construction sites certainly goes further and specifically mentions environmental considerations. We should use this proposal to introduce greater legal certainty. That is exactly what we are trying to do in our amendments, by seeking to highlight the provision of information to workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a very serious risk. According to Cancer Research UK, skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the UK. Cases of skin cancer there have more than doubled since the 1980s. The UK now has more cases of skin cancer than Australia. More than 69 000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year and over 2 000 people die each year in the UK from skin cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not specific to the UK. In Germany, skin cancer among agricultural workers has risen by between 15% and 20% over the last decade alone. Please take a look at the statistics in your own countries. This is a global, not a national, phenomenon. So let us use the EU-wide legal base we have to provide greater protection for all our workers.</p>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation on this directive. I now hope that all MEPs, including the Socialists, will see sense and either completely remove natural radiation from this directive, or at least pass the compromise that we voted for in committee and leave it up to Member States. It is absolutely ludicrous to keep it in. I thought it was a joke when I first read it. I did not believe that the Council and the Commission could actually be serious about this. It would bring the EU into further disrepute if we legislate against the sun in the workplace. Apart from that, this is a reasonably sensible directive, to protect people like welders from artificial radiation, but we should not include natural radiation from the sun. As the text stands at present, employers would be required to do a risk assessment every day, bringing in technical and organisational measures to protect workers. What does that mean? Keeping them in from the sun a lot of the time? Providing protective equipment, such as sunglasses, hats, or sun tan cream, and making sure that they wear them? It is no business of the EU to tell workers that they cannot be bare-chested or wear shorts. They are adults.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine the language if workers were told to cover up when they were trying to get a sun tan from their holiday. And how would you prove liability? If a worker gets skin cancer, was it in the workplace, was it on the beach, was it in the back garden? It would in my opinion be a legal nightmare. Yes, everyone should be warned about the dangers of the sun, but that should not be up to employers. Government campaigns should warn everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">If we pass this directive and include natural radiation, this would be taking the 'nanny state' mentality too far. I sincerely hope that all MEPs will either vote to remove natural radiation from the text, or vote for the compromise in committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only thing about the so-called minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation) – as the title puts it – to gain a firm hold on the public mind was that Brussels, in its mania for regulation, sought even to outlaw the rays of the sun, requiring barmaids to refrain from wearing low-cut dresses and even banning footballers from wearing shorts in future. I am sure that I do not need to point out to the House that this directive is solely concerned with prevention and with protective measures in the workplace and with improving precautions against skin cancers – not least as an occupational illness.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, we would have no need of rules and regulations if, for example, the old dress codes to deal with natural optical radiation were still in place, with it being taken for granted that someone working in the sun would wear a hat and clothing to protect the skin. Nor would we have much need of them if the sun’s ultra-violet rays were not constantly being made more dangerous by the depletion of the ozone layer. It is, alas, an established fact – and one to which a number of Members have referred – that incidences of skin cancer have multiplied over recent years, particularly among those working in construction and agriculture, neither of which can be regarded as privileged occupations.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that we have to answer today is whether or not we want to protect these workers better against optical radiation, just as we do against noise, vibration and electro-magnetic radiation, and do so, moreover, to an equal degree in every Member State, and whether or not we want to guarantee the recognition of skin cancer as an occupational illness throughout the EU. We must not shuffle off our own powers and responsibilities onto the Member States, who are responsible for implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">While health is a fundamental asset for every individual, it also has an economic dimension, so we should adopt the Council’s proposed minimum requirements – remembering that they are minimum requirements! – while rejecting Articles 4 and 5, which have been completely watered down. As a matter of principle, we Greens share the Socialist Group’s position and call for minimum standards for proper protection at work in all EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore incomprehensible that members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have voiced their opposition to the adoption of measures aimed at strengthening the protection of workers exposed to natural radiation. Under such measures, the onus will fall on employers to assess the health and safety risks, so that the steps needed to reduce those risks can be identified and implemented, for example by means of an action plan involving technical and/or organisational measures aimed at reducing health and safety risks to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what happened in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in respect of Articles 4(2) and 5(2), as mentioned previously, in an attempt to ensure that these proposals did not cover workers in relation to optical radiation. We naturally feel that workers’ health must be protected, and therefore have difficulty in accepting the Council Presidency’s compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Member States may take account of the nature of the activities undertaken and levels of exposure to the sun, and may lay down specific criteria for such a risk assessment to observe. What is important, however, is that minimum values be established that take account of the World Trade Organisation’s data, which show that thousands of people in Europe have died of skin cancer, a disease that is on the rise throughout the EU. Consequently, workers in sectors such as agriculture, construction, tourism, law enforcement – that is to say, anyone who works in the open air – must be protected. This is why we have tabled proposals aimed at reinstating at least basic levels of protection for all workers in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time-consuming programmes of action to deal with sunburn will be devised; lifeguards in open-air swimming pools will virtually have to wrap themselves up, and serving staff in hostelries with gardens will evidently have to carry not just trays but also a variable parasol or two.</p>
<p class="contents">What is put together here on – and let this be borne in mind! – 42 whole pages, is a burden on businesses, puts jobs at risk and is a cause of justified outrage on the part of the public. The rapporteur, Mr Őry, has done a very good job of work in presenting a compromise in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, where it gained a majority, albeit an extremely narrow one.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want to achieve is for the Member States themselves to decide what to do with this ‘sunshine directive’. By means of this proposal, we have run up the flag of realism and signalled our opposition to overweening bureaucracy. Surely, the failure of the referenda in some Member States – while others hesitate to move on with the decision-making process – shows that the public will accept the European Union only if we concentrate on the essentials, take the issues really seriously and make use of our powers and responsibilities. Mrs Lynne is right to say that we risk bringing the EU into disrepute.</p>
<p class="contents">Over ten years have passed since this document on optical radiation was given its first reading. The former version of it bears next to no relation to the present one. It is irrelevant – and cannot be anything else – to say that we are going to protect workers in the same way right across Europe when we are well aware that the climate zones in our countries differ enormously. Workers have themselves learned from years of experience what they can and must do about optical radiation. Some can cope with the sun extremely well and other cannot at all. They come to their own individual solutions, and in that we must not interfere.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is right to say that what we have seen here is a lack of willingness to compromise on the part of the Council, whose attitude, exemplified not least by this abstruse new proposal, really is far removed from reality. Needless to say, the Federal Government still in office in Germany has gone along with it. We, the MEPs belonging to the CDU and CSU, will be consistent and reject a Common Position that does not guarantee subsidiarity.

I do not believe, Mr Mann, that protecting workers’ health puts jobs at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Őry pointed out, this proposal for a directive is simply the fourth part of a set of laws on which Parliament and the Council have already expressed opinions and which is aimed, from a health and safety perspective, at protecting workers against the risks connected with exposure to physical agents. As you know, we have already adopted provisions relating to vibrations, noise and electromagnetic fields. In the present case, we are led to draw a distinction between radiation from artificial sources and that from natural sources. At the same time, however, there is an element of obscurity – if you will excuse the terminology – in your speeches and reasoning concerning health and, in particular, public health policies: you draw no distinction between the risk to which someone – in this instance, a worker – is exposed because of natural rays and that to which he or she is exposed because of artificial radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the provisions proposed in the common position do in fact take account of the difference between standing in front of a machine and being exposed to solar radiation due to outdoor work, we need specific policies for each eventuality, even if we do consider that, in the end, what has been implemented by the Community under Article 137 of the Single Act should be enough. In other words, we should take steps to ensure that health and safety measures are laid down for the purpose of protecting all EU workers in their work places. Not to do so would be to give up, and that is something we cannot do. There is a new risk. There is data that cannot be ignored from both the World Health Organisation and our national health bodies, showing that the number of cancers linked to exposure to the sun is on the increase. It is increasing, in particular, in occupations involving exposure to the sun, something that cannot be explained merely in terms, for example, of the variables of holidays and other free time. There is exposure to the sun in the construction, civil engineering and tourist industries. Police in charge of security are also very often out of doors. A much longer list of the occupations concerned could be drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a responsibility, and the proposal being made is reasonable inasmuch as it takes account of companies’ need to be able to meet this type of obligation at low cost. It is a question of information, training, assessment and prevention. It is, in actual fact, a question of laying down obligations for employers, because the fact is, workers are dependent upon their employers. Some people maintain that the proposal is too precise and that the Community and the European Union will make themselves look ridiculous. My own observation is that, in the economic field, legislation can never be too precise. When it comes to financial regulations, the internal market or the banking sphere, we are adept at voting in favour of precise standards. The point is, we need, I think, also to be capable of being precise when it comes to people’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not agree with the notion whereby European standards and rules have to be compulsory in the economic field but whereby subsidiarity and opt-out clauses need systematically to be invoked when it comes to social rights and to the protection of workers’ health. That is why we do not want the content of this legislation to be distorted and why, where prevention and the provision of information are concerned, we want all EU workers to be offered standards such as will help combat the development of skin cancer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Essentially, we need to strike a balance between the health and safety of workers and the temptation to over-legislate – to be too prescriptive – and to override the principle of subsidiarity and attempt a ‘one size fits all’ piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last session, when speaking on the Nitrates Directive, I stated that not even the European Parliament can legislate for weather across Europe and I have not changed my mind. Therefore, in this context, given the wide variation of climatic conditions across Europe, I consider it appropriate that decisions regarding the health and safety of workers from exposure to sunlight are best taken by the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no comparison between the health and safety concerns as a result of exposure to sunlight, for instance, between a Nigerian worker on an Irish building site and an Irish worker on a Greek building site. However, this is not an issue to be ignored, and employers have a real responsibility – primarily, I believe, by means of awareness raising – as regards practical preventative measures, whereby employees who work outdoors can make informed choices about their exposure to sunlight and the need to take practical precautions to protect themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The specialised directive with which we are concerned today does no more than lay down the framework for these measures, and does so in a balanced and appropriate manner, including in those situations in which we cannot keep tabs on the source, and so I cannot for the life of me understand why the employers’ associations are opposed to such legal certainty. After all, the only alternatives they have are to resort to simple actions such as the provision of notices or up-to-date information on health risks or else to run the risk of court rulings recognising occupational illnesses. I cannot understand why they do not go for the cheaper option, and so I regard the CSU amendment as making for greater legal uncertainty and as detrimental particularly to small businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt in my mind that the protection of workers from health risks arising from optical radiation is a matter that should be regulated at EU level. After all, such an approach also reflects the findings of the report which I tabled on health protection at work, and which the House adopted some time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">As one of the previous speakers noted, the World Health Organisation has reported that the number of people dying of skin cancer is in the thousands. This means that there is a clear need to afford greater protection to workers who are exposed to optical radiation, in particular from natural sources. I fail to understand the logic of those Members who wish to exclude natural radiation, and I am likewise opposed to those amendments aimed at allowing employers to decide for themselves whether or not to raise their employees’ awareness about optical radiation and to protect them from it. Protecting workers is not cheap, but it is indispensable if we genuinely wish to improve health protection at work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Which way do we want Europe to go? We are experiencing a constitutional crisis. We are going through a financial crisis. People no longer understand Europe. We have to make every effort to get the public back on board. The proposed rules on natural radiation in the Common Position will do the precise opposite, being a classic example of excessive regulation and the bureaucratic approach. They bear no relation to the European Union’s efforts at deregulation. The Commission and the Council are always talking about better lawmaking as a means towards more growth and job creation in the EU. My concept of ‘better regulation’, though, is a rather different one; it is that it is with regulations such as these that we must make a start. With their requirements for protection against the sun, the Council and the Commission are shooting well wide of the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">The mere fact that a variety of climate conditions prevail in the EU means that there are also many practical considerations militating against a Europe-wide regulation of this kind. I do not believe that protecting workers from the sun should be treated with the same importance in Finland as in Spain or Greece. We are taking responsibility away from the people of Europe; whatever happened to workers’ personal responsibility? How, moreover, can it be determined whether sunburn was sustained during leisure or at work? What about the problem of liability if employers carry out the comprehensive risk assessments in relation to the sun’s rays, which this directive will finally impose?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you another brief example. I had a discussion with a workplace safety and protection officer, who told me how he had stood beside a worker, next to whom was a metre-high jet of flame. He asked the worker why he did not put the flame out, to which the reply was: ‘you are the one who is responsible for safety in the workplace’. That is an example of why we need to give workers a sense of being responsible for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we in this House will be able to indicate our desire for the dismantlement of bureaucracy and for deregulation, and to send a message to the effect that we have learned something from the referenda in France and the Netherlands. Like Mr Mann, Mr Bushill-Matthews, and many other MEPs, I have tabled amendments aimed at removing the sun from the scope of the directive. I ask you to support our amendments or at least the compromise adopted in the Committee. We must regain the trust of the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendment tabled by Mr Ferber and Mr Nassauer, with its aim of rejecting the Common Position as a whole, now marks the climax of this campaign, and it is truly a sad sight. One might have expected an amendment like this from the British Tories, but not from the CDU/CSU; with it, these Members are expressing their opposition to workplace protection in the EU as a whole, and it has to be said that their putting it up for grabs also runs counter to their former position on workplace protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The CDU/CSU voted in favour of all three of the other workplace protection directives; it supported all of them. Can someone perhaps explain to me why they want to improve the protection of workers in the workplace from hazards arising from vibration, noise and electromagnetic radiation, but not from those resulting from optical radiation?</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Weisgerber I have to say that anyone who refers, in the title of their press release, to a ‘sunshine directive’, is consciously aiming to misinform. You are well aware, Mrs Weisgerber, that this directive is primarily concerned with protection from artificial radiation, but you have nothing to say about that; instead, you take natural radiation and fabricate a bogeyman, hypocritically prating about being close to the citizens. All this is obliging employers to inform their workers about the health risks associated with sunlight, a point reiterated with great clarity by our PSE Group’s two amendments. Whether – and, if so, how – the workers protect themselves again the sun’s rays in practice is still left to them alone to decide. The handing out of notice sheets is surely not too much to ask. In the past, doing that sort of thing got a lot done on the workplace protection front.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also want to allow the Member States to define their own specific criteria for how the risk assessment is to be carried out. That does indeed take proper account of subsidiarity, but what we Socialists cannot go along with is <span class="italic">à la carte</span> workplace protection in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No serious person would question the desirability of protecting workers from skin cancer. In Scotland, despite our northern latitude, this is a serious and pressing issue. The question for us is whether the inclusion of sunlight within this measure would achieve it. The inclusion of natural light renders, sadly, the sensible proposals within this package unworkable, legally difficult to enforce and practically difficult to manage. I am glad to hear the rapporteur mention subsidiarity. Hopefully, if all else fails it will allow a greater degree of common sense to be brought through in the application of this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scottish National Party is concerned that these measures, while laudable in aim, will not achieve the desired result. Rather, we fear that the inclusion of sunlight in this package will add to the burden upon farmers, fishermen, foresters, businesses in general and others, without necessarily achieving the desired health effects. We believe that there is a need to legislate in this area. We do not accept that this is the way to do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope the sun is shining upon him there and that he is being instructed to cover up well.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous part-session, in July, was the first attended by the UK as Presidency of the Council. We were promised many things: the new Presidency was going to simplify the burdens on business, reduce red tape and provide leadership to make the EU more relevant to the people. The whole House, including this side of the House, should support such an agenda if, indeed, it happens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first part-session since then, the first chance for all of us to judge the UK Presidency on whether it means what it says. Today the judgement is already becoming clear, because what we have on the agenda is more red tape, not less: we have a directive that calls for businesses to record how much the sun is shining. The UK Presidency is trying to downplay this whole directive, claiming that it is all very straightforward and that the fuss is far-fetched.</p>
<p class="contents">If that were true, why have I and my colleagues been getting increasingly frantic messages from organisations and individual companies of all sizes, in such major industries as agriculture, horticulture, construction, tourism and hospitality? They have not taken their information from so-called 'misleading press releases' – despite the predictable spin from Mr Hughes and his Socialist colleagues – but straight from the directive. They are not just imagining problems for the sake of it; they are detailing specific problems in the common position that the Council simply did not foresee when it nodded it through. The Presidency in particular should have very red faces now, though I suspect not from sunburn.</p>
<p class="contents">Our role in this House is clearly to help shape EU legislation that is appropriate and proportionate. In its current form, this proposal is neither. If the UK Presidency will not give a lead, our political group will. We have tabled amendments to throw out the common position completely, to remove all references to natural sunlight and to get some sense back into this directive. We are glad to have support from many of the Liberal Democrats, as well as from other political groups. However, this whole House should give out the message loud and clear. People do not want politicians to protect them from sunlight; increasingly, people simply want to be protected from politicians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only, for example, did it take decades to get occupational illnesses recognised as such, but the provision and wearing of ear protectors in training establishments was not, for a long time, regarded as health protection either, and now artificial and optical radiation, something of such great importance to workers has become a fit topic for polemics by the redtop press.</p>
<p class="contents">Where this proposal for a directive on optical radiation is concerned, we should go back to what the Council proposed. It is no more than a polemical trick to compare natural sunlight with a sunbed. There is, after all, a difference between a worker being exposed to extreme solar radiation for the whole of the day, and a person doing some sunbathing – which, if they are sensible, will be for a brief period of time. In considering these things, we have to bear in mind the demonstrable sharp increase in the risk of skin cancer in Europe, a risk taken by building workers, forestry workers and other workers exposed to the sun in the open air. Requiring employers and health and safety officers to provide information on extreme weather conditions when these occur is surely not to demand disproportionate expenditure on their part, and is something that should be taken seriously. Greater legal certainly also makes perfect sense from the point of view of both worker protection and insurance and is a necessity. It might be added that Members of this House should, where workers are concerned, be guided in their decision-making by an awareness of their problems rather than by ignorance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing here with a piece of the European Parliament’s legal history, for it was in 1992 that the Commission came to a decision on the subject, and today finds us debating it at – and let me stress this – its <span class="italic">second </span>reading. When we vote on it, as we will do tomorrow, we will be bound by the rule that a majority is required to reject or amend it. Speaking as someone who was not even an MEP at the time of its first reading, I have to say that I find it intolerable that neither the Commission nor the Council are similarly bound in the case of a proposal made at a time when most of us were not yet MEPs. Even though the Rules of Procedure permit it, I was not able to table any amendments in the Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we should all press for such curiosities to be done away with. It is also a reason why the CDU/CSU has tabled this motion for the directive to be rejected; we did so not because we reject justified measures in relation to unnatural optical radiation, but in order to call on the Commission to come up with a proposal that would be credible in terms of the Constitution and of Lisbon. President Barroso and his colleagues always get carried away when analysing the reasons why the Constitution was rejected, and regularly invoke the Lisbon objectives. If you put them on the spot on the subject of regulation and directives, the line they take is: ‘the sunshine directive? I was not in office at the time’. At the same time, though, there is no shortage of officials in the Commission who quite simply ignore whatever their bosses say. Better regulation? Of what interest is that to those to whom the protection of consumers is entrusted, those who are supposed to take action to deal with this? For them, it is ‘business as usual’.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, this is not an issue for only one end of the political spectrum; I would just like to remind Mrs Jöns of the President of the German Council of Cities. This may have passed her by during the summer recess, but, in any case, the President of the German Council of Cities, who is also at the same time the Lord Mayor of Munich, and, as she will be aware, a member of the SPD, has held up the sunshine directive to ridicule. We see, then, that there is in Germany a broad political consensus to the effect that we are in favour of rules that are practicable. The compromise would take us closer to them. The motion for rejection calls upon the Commission to come up with something better; if it is not passed, I call upon you to at least support the compromise motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Protection of workers’ health and safety is at the heart of a social Europe. This directive is precisely an attempt to improve workers’ conditions by emphasising all the dangers to health to which workers are exposed in the work place as a result of optical radiation. Sunlight presents a risk to the many people who work out of doors every day. There have been seven times as many cases of skin cancer in the last 30 years, and it is beyond doubt that the risk of contracting skin cancer is far higher for those employed in, for example, the construction sector or agriculture. That is the reality to which we have to respond, and those are the figures that make it our duty to demand that, in future, employers inform their workers as to how they are to protect themselves against the sun’s dangerous rays. Radiation in the work place is dangerous, and there is a need for common European rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been given the task of describing all the risks to which workers are exposed in working life. The sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays endanger people and naturally need to feature in the directive. For workers, cancer is no less real whether caused by natural or artificial radiation. Workers naturally have a responsibility for their own health and safety. We demand only that employers also accept their share of responsibility. We have found a solution that does not overburden employers and that includes worker protection. We can only interpret right-of-centre opposition as another attempt to renationalise labour market legislation. It is an entirely incomprehensible point of view, which will distort competition within the EU’s borders. There must be common European rules. That is the only way in which we can guarantee decent conditions for all European wage earners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to begin by asking the Commissioner to indicate very clearly what the Commission's views are on this debate, on the amendments and on what has happened in the various committees. It would have been helpful if we had known your mind before we started, Commissioner, because we are speaking in a vacuum. Maybe you agree with what this or that side is saying, but we would like to know where you stand.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, we have a good piece of legislation: the framework directive requesting employers to mitigate health risks for employees. None of us disagree with that. We have already dealt with vibration, noise, electro-magnetic fields and now we are faced with optical radiation. I agree with it – it is a good piece of legislation – with the sole exception of the inclusion of solar radiation. We need legal certainty in the field of employment, both for employers and employees. There is no legal certainty in the area of risk assessment for exposure to solar radiation in the workplace, and it is a legal certainty that in a litigious age it will end up as a lawyers' charter, and nothing else.</p>
<p class="contents">If I choose to spend 10 hours on a beach on Saturday or Sunday, or 10 hours in the garden at 80 degrees exposed to the sun, or on the golf course in very hot sunshine, all the health authorities would say that it was far too long. What colleagues have said about skin cancer is absolutely true. But if I choose to spend my leisure time taking excess exposure to the sun, then go into the workplace on a Monday, say, and I am working on a construction site, or in the fields, in a vineyard, at a sports venue, beside a swimming pool or wherever, and I am already overexposed through lack of personal responsibility at the weekend, is it my employer's duty to ensure that I should not have any extra exposure to the sun on the Monday? Two hours might be too much in that case, let alone four hours.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am a red-haired, fair-skinned Irish person, two hours' sunshine is the maximum I should get, and with proper coverage from the sun, with a hat, covering up my skin and wearing protection. But if I am a dark-haired, brown-eyed, dark-skinned southern European, I could spend six or seven hours in the sunshine to no effect at all. What do the employers do, line up their employees on a Monday morning and check their skin types and whether they have been overexposed at the weekend? Or check whether they have been toasted on both sides at Torremolinos during the previous fortnight when they were on holiday and say 'Sorry, you can't go in the sun this week at all'? It is impossible to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">We want legal certainty. We want to leave personal responsibility to the individual. Yes, we want informed choices from a health point of view – everybody, not just employees, should be informed of the risks to over-exposure – but please, say to President Barroso for all of us, that, if he is serious about Lisbon-proofing regulation and about less regulation being better regulation, then we do not need this nanny-type regulation and solar radiation must be removed from the directive. It cannot be left to Member States, since there is a legal problem, I understand. Risk assessment cannot be left to each Member State under the terms of framework Directive 89/391, because it is a Community competence only. Please tell us what the options are and where you stand on this, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Commission and the Council are aware that protection against risks from natural sources should be the subject of differential treatment, and the common position reflects this difference. I shall therefore explain in detail the Commission’s position on the amendments. I very much wish firstly to thank Parliament for its work and for the debate that has taken place. During the long and difficult legislative process, the Commission has been keen to do everything to ensure that this document still offers a high level of protection for workers, while avoiding discriminating between workers exposed to similar risks, and that it does so in compliance with framework Directive 89/391 and while ensuring the necessary proportionality. The aim has been to enable a compromise acceptable to all the institutions concerned to be reached by the end of the process. The Commission is not, then, able to accept what is stated, particularly in a number of newspapers, to the effect that the text of the common position is the result of a fruitless exercise, likely to give Europeans an image of the European Union as something sterile and bureaucratic. The Commission thinks that the common position is a balanced text responding to the real dangers constituted by the eye diseases and skin cancers, or melanomas, that are an issue for all Europeans and thinks that it is perfectly in keeping with the terms of the European Parliament’s recent resolution on the promotion of health and safety. Obviously, ways must be found of avoiding what could be pointless burdens on our companies and, as many have emphasised, on small and medium-sized companies in particular. Amendments 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 36 on the one hand emphasise the need for early detection of health effects and, on the other hand, specify the level of qualifications required by those responsible for medical surveillance. The Commission is able to accept these amendments. The Commission is also able to accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 34 and 35. They improve the text and reinforce and clarify the meaning of the provision concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot, however, accept, as they stand, Amendments 5, 7 and 37 which propose giving each Member State the competence to legislate on the appropriateness, or otherwise, of employers assessing the risks in the case of exposure to natural sources of radiation. Beyond the considerations of protecting workers’ health to which I referred a few moments ago, such provisions would, in fact, be contrary to the obligations imposed on employers by framework Directive 89/391 to take account of all the risks and to make an assessment of the risks in all cases. Adopting these amendments – and I would lay some stress upon this, since it is an important point of law – would involve something of a transfer of responsibility from the employer to the national legislator. Where employment law and working conditions are concerned, this would, I believe, pose a real problem and would not, in my opinion, make the task an easy one for countries to carry out. I would therefore emphasise this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, and even if it understands the reasons that may lie behind them, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 18 in favour of rejecting the common position, Amendments 21 and 24 that exclude, in particular, taking account of particularly vulnerable risk groups or the effects of interaction with photosensitive substances, and the full range of Amendments 19 to 23 and 25 to 33 which exclude optical radiation from natural sources from the scope of the directive. The Commission intends working with Parliament and the Council to find a solution enabling the directive to be adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendments 4 and 13, which introduce a provision asking it to draw up a practical guide, the Commission is ready to examine the best way of responding to this. At the same time, it is concerned to avoid procedures that might impair the wording of Community legislation governed by an interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">So there we have it, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission wants the amendments that will be adopted tomorrow to enable the text of the new directive entirely to fulfil the objectives laid down by Article 137 of the Treaty when it comes to workers’ health and social protection. I would take the liberty of emphasising personally the quality of the compromise arrived at. This has been done by differentiating properly between sources of risk and by authorising – in a simple way, I believe, particularly for risks arising from natural sources – a number of precautionary measures of which it will be a simple matter to remind workers in the interests of their health and which thus complete the provisions enabling the health of workers in Europe to be protected and to be so without our entering into a wealth of detail and complications.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, I think that this compromise genuinely deserves Parliament’s undivided attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fundamental interests of workers demand that this directive should come into being as soon as possible. We all have an interest in the adoption of this report. From our point of view, this is a technical matter and in such instances there is always a good chance of reaching a consensus. In the course of the debate, however, some technical reservations have been voiced.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge of the risks, use of protective equipment and strict compliance with safety regulations are essential, not only for visual protection but for health protection in all its other aspects as well. The range of occupational hazards is extremely broad, and the risk of harmful health effects and of developing chronic diseases is considerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Sunshine is a natural phenomenon that is notoriously difficult to legislate on, and some Member States of the European Union do not have very much of it at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take into account that the directive should provide Member States with the broadest possible opportunity, on as many issues as possible, to formulate for themselves, at national level – in consultation with the social partners and within the framework set by the directive – legislation that best suits their given circumstances. There should not be over-regulation, but a balance between the safety of workers and the realities of a given country’s economic and fiscal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We can and will change the overly bureaucratic approach, but protecting health must always be the primary focus of our efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
