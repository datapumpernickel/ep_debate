<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lindh,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, we have just discussed the future of Europe. It is really a new Europe, a new Union, which is in the process of being formed. The greatest change is naturally expansion – the EU is now forging a path for the historic reunification of Europe. Furthermore, we have just begun the debate on the future and are asking the question of what kind of Europe we want.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, we will be discussing the third large process of change, namely the modernisation of the European model, in which the European Council in Stockholm on 23 – 24 March will play a central role. It is about full employment within the EU. It is about quality of work and lifelong learning. It is about social and economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year in Lisbon, the Union made an historic choice in addressing these questions. They are vital to the citizens and thus also for the political legitimacy of the Union. 14 million people in Europe are still unemployed – a <span class="italic">gigantic </span>waste of financial resources and an insult to human knowledge and ambitions. Having a job and being able to earn a living creates a feeling of participation, security and dignity, while unemployment leads to uncertainty, exclusion and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">The road to full employment and increased competitiveness encompasses financial and social reforms such as increased education and lifelong learning, greater equality and modernised social security, strong welfare and quality at work. It demands open and functioning markets, a healthy macroeconomic policy and a commercial climate which facilitates investment and the establishment of new businesses, especially within growing areas such as IT and biotechnology.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a balance between social and economic reforms. All these areas are dependent on each other if the Union is to achieve its high targets by 2010: creating the world’s leading knowledge-based economy, creating 20 million new jobs and combining competitiveness and greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting of the European Council in Stockholm is the first in a series of summits this spring in which we will openly and self-critically asses the progress which has been made and make new strides. The work will be carried out both with community law and the new open coordination method. It is important to focus our measures within the framework of the Lisbon Process, something emphasised by many people in Parliament. We must not undermine this process by adding far too many new questions. We do not need any new processes. Instead, we should point out certain prioritised areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In Stockholm, we will firstly further reinforce the ambitious employment targets of 70% of the entire labour force and 60% of women by 2010. We should consider setting up targets for as early as 2005 and add special targets for the employment of the elderly, a group with enormous potential – only 38% of those aged 55 – 64 are currently in work. As people are living longer and longer and becoming even healthier, many older people feel unwelcome in the labour market – this situation is slightly absurd. We will seek to establish a number of important social objectives for equal opportunities, diversity and participation in the workplace. “Quality of work” – developing quality in working life – is both a welfare issue and the best way of making use of the capacity of employees. We will seek to confirm the central role of lifelong learning, both for individual development and for European competitiveness, and invite the Commission to also draw up objectives for lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly in Stockholm, we expect that important strides will be made in terms of modernising the European economy. We will seek to forge ahead with the reform of the financial markets and achieve a common market for financial services by 2005 at the latest and for risk capital by 2003 at the latest. Achieving this, as Baron Lamfalussy points out in his report, requires a more efficient decision-making process. We hope that agreement on this will be achieved at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to continue work on opening up the electricity, gas and postal markets, as well as rail and air traffic. Opening up product and capital markets is not just an aim in itself. We are not only doing this for the sake of growth and increased employment, but also because it is good for consumers. It means lower prices and a wider range and better quality of goods and services. In this context, external trade policy is also important – free and fair world trade is in the interest of European consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly in Stockholm, we must address the demographic development of Europe. Low birth rates and an increasing proportion of elderly people threaten to greatly increase the support burden for those of working age from around 2010 onwards. We therefore need a wider-ranging overview of pension systems and a discussion of the design of childcare and possibly also health care and care of the elderly. The social insurance systems must make it easier for people to combine work and family life. We also need measures for increased participation in the labour market, greater equality and lifelong learning, to address the demographic challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly in Stockholm, we should facilitate new technology with the aim of creating growth and improving the lives of citizens. We want to develop the opportunity for creating better drugs with the help of biotechnology, naturally taking moral and ethical dimensions into account. We want to develop <span class="italic">e</span>Europe and combat the digital divide so that IT benefits everyone. Talking of the previous debate, I can state that it is the Commission which is responsible for the website. You can therefore contact them with your comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly in Stockholm, we must include the ecological point of view which was lacking in the Lisbon strategy and build a bridge to the summit in Gothenburg. We would like environmentally-friendly technology to also be seen as an important factor for growth and employment, and we would highlight the importance of the efficient use of resources. The Councils of Ministers are now investigating how the candidate countries can be linked to this process on all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the importance of the successful development of Economic and Monetary Union. In its presidency, Sweden will actively work to ensure that the introduction of euro notes and coins, which is to take place in the currency union in early 2002, is an unqualified success. This is in our common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to state that President Putin of Russia will visit Stockholm in connection with the summit on 23 March for an informal working lunch with the Heads of State and Heads of Government of the EU. We assume that the discussion will primarily focus on financial and social issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As usual, the European Council will also discuss current issues in foreign policy, such as the Middle East, the western Balkans and the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, employment and welfare are the most important issues for the citizens of Europe. If we fail, we face, besides increasing unemployment, xenophobia and greater divisions in society, a crisis of confidence in the Union. The Lisbon Process is therefore a prerequisite, not only for sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion in Europe, but also for confidence in European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has constantly been a driving force in all these issues and, through its combination of a popular mandate and Europe-wide responsibility, will also play a central role in the work for the future. I look forward to hearing your opinions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been announced, the presidency has even organised a meeting between European Union leaders and President Putin, on similar lines to the meeting planned with President Bush at Gothenburg in June. This will be an excellent opportunity to review the main aspects of our partnership with Russia and our partnership with the United States as well. In particular, I hope we will be able to take stock of the progress of Russia's economic reform programme and improvements in the investment climate that are vital for the success of our energy dialogue and our dialogue on all issues, including matters of citizens' rights, extremely serious issues that we are to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">The second topic I want to focus briefly on today is the Commission's ‘Spring Report’. When I stood before this House just a year ago, it was to present to you the Commission's contribution to the Lisbon Summit. What the Commission proposed at Lisbon was a detailed strategy for making Europe dynamic and competitive, while, at the same time, promoting social inclusion and solidarity: a strategy for ensuring that economic progress and social progress in Europe go hand in hand. The outcome of that summit was very positive: the Member States unanimously adopted almost all the Commission's proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy adopted at Lisbon is important in two ways. Firstly, it is an integrated strategy; far from there being tension between the social and economic agendas, they actually support each other. Secondly, it sets specific tasks for the different players to carry out within specific time frames.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibilities and targets are therefore clear and we will be able to measure our progress clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy is designed for a ten year period, and progress is to be assessed annually at the Spring European Council. As a basis for this assessment, the Commission will produce an annual progress report (known as the ‘Synthesis Report’), which I shall present to this House every year at about this time. It will become the Commission's key instrument for coordinating social and economic policy. If the Gothenburg European Council agrees, we shall add an environmental dimension, giving Europe an overall strategy for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The synthesis report will outline our successes since Lisbon, but also identify areas where swifter and more determined action is needed over the next twelve months. Among the initial successes I am particularly pleased with this year are the adoption of the Social Agenda at Nice, the endorsement of a strategy on social exclusion, and our progress in combating discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities. These successes should give us great satisfaction and this year's report records them, although it touches only lightly on these particular issues, for we must concentrate on the areas where progress is not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report this year highlights ten areas where progress has been unsatisfactory and fresh or greater impetus needs to be given. Sometimes this is because Member States have been dragging their feet – it has to be said – lacking a sense of urgency or political will, or both. Sometimes it is because circumstances have changed and a new scenario confronts us. Our report therefore makes very specific recommendations, and at Stockholm I shall make every endeavour to urge the Member States to follow them. Moreover, these are commitments that these States have made and therefore European leaders need to deliver on them. Two examples are the Community patent and the GALILEO programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say just a little more about these two issues, which I consider to be particularly important. Firstly: the Community patent. There is an urgent need for a single patent that is legally valid throughout the EU, and there should be a single jurisdiction. This would cut business costs, encourage innovation and provide a clear legal framework for settling disputes. Industry and science are clamouring for it, as it will boost competitiveness and employment – especially in the new sectors we need most. The Lisbon and Feira European Councils recommended that the Community Patent should be available by the end of 2001. I repeat: the Lisbon and Feira Councils called for this. The Commission tabled its proposal last autumn, but the Council has been unable to reach agreement on it as we saw again just this week at the Internal Market Council and this can only be alarming. Above all, we cannot continue to hold Councils where, even in cases in which a majority vote is acceptable, unanimity is strived for and the adoption of proposals deferred. The Member States must act consistently and show a greater sense of responsibility if this project is to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the GALILEO programme. The Kosovo war showed only too clearly Europe's total dependence on the American GPS satellite navigation system. If this is switched off for military reasons, European businesses are forced to suspend many of their operations and there are a number of other examples. Now then, the GALILEO project offers an alternative that would make Europe self-sufficient in satellite navigation signals for all civilian, military and scientific purposes. It is an opportunity we simply cannot afford to miss. It would take only a modest injection of public funds to trigger massive private investment, although I recognise that this private sector participation has yet to be explored in depth, as some governments have been requesting and as, moreover, we undertook to do. This project, which I see many countries almost do not want to be involved with, could generate more than 100 000 high-level scientific jobs. I therefore urge this House and the Council to come to an agreement very soon on the next stage of development of this important project. The Commission, for its part, will display the necessary flexibility as regards the participation of private capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to expand on one of the ten priority areas we identified. I will not go into the whole caboodle, to coin a phrase, just the last point: ‘Effective social protection for an ageing population’. I have picked this topic because it is particularly close to my heart and because it has huge scope; because it has far-reaching implications for all our policies and because it will take us from Stockholm to Gothenburg, which means sustainable development; and because it is an issue that will stay with us for many years to come. The Lisbon agenda is set against the background of a major challenge: our ageing population. I am happy to say that Europeans are living longer, but they are also having fewer children and working less. In the European Union, at present, for every person of 65 or over there are four people of working age. In 20 years' time, there will be only three and in 40 years' time only two potential workers to every pensioner. These are the actual data, given that those who have not been born cannot be born in the future: these are the current demographic statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">This also applies to almost all the candidate countries as well as the Member States. In other words, a shrinking workforce will have to support a rapidly growing number of non-working people even in the enlarged European Union. These are stark, statistical facts that we have to take into consideration. Do we want Europe to remain a fair, caring society, which is our goal? Do we want our children and grandchildren to enjoy the kind of social security we have come to expect? Then we must modernise our welfare and pension systems, making them sustainable in the long term. We need a strategy for consolidating Europe's long-term competitiveness without giving up the social inclusion that characterises our societies. I want Europe to be not only the most competitive region in the world, but also the region with the highest level of social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The post-war era has brought unprecedented prosperity to all the States of European society. Today, our societies are – on average – the wealthiest in history. At the same time, well-developed welfare and pension systems have distributed our wealth so as to ensure a minimum of social justice: not the level we had hoped for but still a minimum level of social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these systems were built on the criteria of expanding or at least stable populations. Now that our working population is shrinking, we are facing a potential structural crisis in the distribution of wealth, a crisis that could, in the space of a few decades, severely undermine the European Union's competitiveness, Economic and Monetary Union and our social model, given that our objective is to preserve a sound social protection model. We must therefore take action now. We need to develop a long-term policy mix and start to think very hard about what sort of social justice and intergenerational equity we want, and what our political criteria for achieving it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Social protection systems are, of course, a national responsibility, and, I would stress, it is primarily up to the Member States – not the European Union institutions – to bring about the necessary reforms. There are, however, four key areas where we have to develop appropriate strategies. They are intergenerational equity, distribution of work, social and family policy and immigration. Although the national governments are free to act autonomously in these matters, we must give thought to their development here.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: intergenerational equity. The ageing of our societies is placing a substantial extra financial burden on certain generations. If no adjustments are made, today's younger generation will have to pay not only for their parents' and grandparents' retirement pensions but also for their own, because by the time they retire the pension system will have become unworkable. If adjustments are not made to take full account of the demographic factor, parts of today's adult generation could fall into poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the distribution of work. Not everyone of working age actually works. Quite apart from the difficulties preventing young people from entering the labour market early enough, there is a trend towards early retirement that shortens people's working lives by 10 years or more. This aggravates the long-term strain on the pension systems. Moreover, as of about 2007, our workforce could be too small to meet our economic needs. We shall be facing a labour shortage in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, therefore, all generations will have to work longer. We need to keep older people active in the economy, at least part time. We must ensure they have the skills needed for types of work that may be new to them. Therefore – and this is our duty – we shall urge the Member States to invest much more in education and training for young and old alike. Lifelong learning is essential in order to update people's skills constantly and enable them to adapt to change. This policy should help ease labour shortages, improve intergenerational equity and give the citizens a more satisfying old age.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: social and family policy: There are far too few women in work. The employment rate for women is only just over 70% of the employment rate for men. In its report for Stockholm, the Commission urges the Member States to make it easier for women to enter or re-enter the labour market. Women must, of course, be given the same job opportunities, working conditions and pension schemes as men, and we must make it easier for both sexes to reconcile work and family life, especially if we want to encourage people to have children. In short, we need to take ever better care of our increasingly depleted human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly: immigration. Bringing young people with the right skills into the European Union is another way to increase the size of our workforce. We have a frontier-free, Europe-wide labour market: we urgently need a Europe-wide immigration policy to match. The basis for this policy should be the ‘shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments within the Union’ which the Tampere European Council called for. Last November, the Commission issued a communication on this subject, and I hope that this House and the Council will examine it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I said just now that pensions and social protection systems are essentially national responsibilities and that it is for the Member States to bring about the necessary reforms. Nevertheless, the European Union, and the Commission in particular, does have a responsibility in this field. To conclude my speech, let me therefore outline what the Commission is doing to provide adequate responses to the problems linked to the ageing population.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the great successes of Lisbon was that the Member States agreed, for the first time, to coordinate their action on welfare reform, exchanging experiences and best practices. This process must be enhanced. They also mandated the High Level Working Party on Social Protection to study the sustainability of social protection and, in particular, of pension systems, on the basis of a Commission communication. Thus, welfare reform is part of the Lisbon agenda and the Commission is playing its part. It will make clear the true scale of the demographic problem so that the European public can understand it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, our public finance accounting systems do not give a true picture at present. We need to develop indicators that show the long-term implications of our social spending and tax decisions, in particular with regard to pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to bring the single market fully into play with regard to pensions. At present, unlike insurance, pension funds are not covered by a European Union legal framework. However, the Commission is fully committed to bringing the single market into full play here. We have already tabled a proposal for a directive and I hope the Council will act swiftly on it. This directive forms part of our Financial Services Action Plan that the European Council agreed should be implemented within five years. I urge this House and the Council to speed up their work on this plan.</p>
<p class="contents">A properly regulated, pan-European pension fund market will increase the mobility of workers and pensioners and give them better value for money. At present, pension provision is unnecessarily expensive, and this is a waste we can no longer afford. Pension schemes must therefore be made fully portable within the European Union. At Stockholm, Member States will have to sweep away the tax barriers that obstruct the cross-border payment of pension contributions and the cross-border management of pension funds. We are not talking about a tax revolution here: this is a matter of an extremely sensible adjustment, to which the citizens have every right. Coordination of national tax systems is essential here, and the Commission will be tabling its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is vital that we address the effects of ageing on public finances. The effects of ageing on our social systems must reinforce our commitment to reducing public debt. The interest saved must be used to support pensions and healthcare. This is a matter of social justice, and the Commission's Synthesis Report will urge the Member States to continue the reforms already under way along these lines. The citizens need time to make provision for their old age. Action is required now to prevent social systems from losing public credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly, we need to incorporate the long-term sustainability aspect of public finances into Economic and Monetary Union. The current 'close to balance' rule in the EMU Stability and Growth Pact has done a great service to the cause of safe pensions. We must acknowledge this fact and be proud of it, but the long-term sustainability of public finances is not included in the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Imagine, for example, that a particular Member State is currently running balanced budgets but that its spending programmes will mean increasing deficits and debt within the next ten years. In a situation of this kind, the European Union can do nothing to induce that country to change course because the European Union does not possess the necessary instruments, nor does it possess the instruments to influence the quality of the adjustments undertaken, yet that country's chances of long-term success basically depend on their getting the adjustments right today. This was less important in the run-up to EMU, where action had to be taken in the short to medium term, but the ageing of our population makes long-term action on public finances essential.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need, therefore, is a renewed commitment to maintaining stable public finances that can sustain social protection in the longer term. Indeed, sound public finances must be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development in Europe. The Commission will be proposing just such a strategy, and it will be the main subject of the Gothenburg Summit in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject I have chosen to raise in this House today is a difficult and technical one, but it is crucial for the prosperity of future generations in Europe. There is not, and there never will be, one single model of social inclusion in Europe. Each Member State will make its own choice, reflecting its own traditions, culture and the will of its people. Nevertheless, we have to establish an overall framework, and this can only be done at European Union level. This House is, of course, the European institution where the democratic debates on the fundamental aspects of our fellow citizens' future have to take place. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, my Commission is ready to fully play its part together with you.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Suominen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (FI) </span>Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the target the Union set itself a year ago in Lisbon to become the world’s most competitive and dynamic economic area, which could achieve both sustainable growth and create new and better jobs, and greater social cohesion, hardly lacks ambition. There may be unanimity regarding the aim; there are, however, clear political differences when it comes to the choice of remedies and how they are prioritised.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, would like to emphasise that the following are some of the most important ways of fulfilling this aim: full implementation of the Single Market, the speedy liberalisation of monopolies, such as the electricity and gas boards and the Post Office, and opening up public procurement to genuine competition, without letting the question of local employment blur the issue. We would like to stress that employment targets will be achieved by encouraging entrepreneurship, SMEs being the most significant employers. We would like to stress that excessive regulation, too much faith in the omnipotence of legislation, and burdensome taxation are the worst enemies of employment. We would also like to emphasise that an innovative and information-based economy, in which everyone is given equal opportunities and individuals are given the right to get ahead and live their lives according to their own goals, means making the European labour markets a lot more flexible. It is this very lack of flexibility that separates us from the efficient US economy. Another way of increasing efficiency is to strengthen our educational systems by making them more adaptable to the needs of individuals. We must have educational establishments maintained by the state, but we also need private ones so that a competition situation may develop, based both on the students and the choice of different educational approaches. In our opinion, modernising the European social model must be made to move up a gear by making it less dependent on publicly financed collective solutions that aim to maintain social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to become the world’s best economy, we have to ask ourselves a few questions. Has the US economy grown as a result of restrictions there, over-taxation, legislation introduced with the apparent aim of giving protection, artificially preserving unproductive jobs, restricting competition or seeking to increase federal bureaucracy? Not at all; just the opposite, in fact! Have Sweden, and Finland too, seen success as IT countries in Europe and achieved peak growth because they have imposed more and more regulation? No. It is because for just over a decade both countries have invested in training and research and their conservative governments reduced the hold the state had on the economy. Has Ireland succeeded through regulation? No, it has deregulated and supported external investments by means of tax concessions, doing so well that we even have to give it a telling off for its success. The remedies for improved employment levels are simple. They are those I have mentioned, and not the well-intentioned but ineffective remedies of guardianship, control, and planning, which our socialist friends so greatly favour.</p>
<p class="contents">In the run-up to the Stockholm meeting Parliament must, however, voice a concern to the Commission and the Council. The gulf between the targets set and the measures taken to implement them is widening on a daily basis, although there are certainly differences between the various countries. The Council must achieve results quickly in its continued programme of liberalisation and improving the business climate, especially now that we are clearly headed for a period of uncertainty, with the USA in the lead, as prices on the stock markets fall and confidence weakens in companies and amongst consumers. If confidence goes, the strong economy goes too, and who will then give us guarantees of better jobs, better education and greater social cohesion?</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon process is not the only one which has seen a hiccup in the European machine. Although the decisions taken at Tampere on a common security area have remained in the background in the debate, their implementation has been just as slow, if not slower, than the Lisbon process. If we do not effectively prevent crime there cannot even be a real Single Market or Schengen area. A viable Single Market also requires, to mention just one detail, a viable, effective and safe air traffic system. At the moment, two countries, Spain and Britain, could torpedo efforts to achieve air safety and increased efficiency by squabbling over the insignificant airport at Gibraltar. It is hard to believe that the same countries are advising how to solve the Balkan crisis or the situation that has flared up in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank – as Mr Poettering did – Mrs Lindh for her very constructive approach to the Stockholm meeting. I might even say you are welcome to join our group when your ministerial term has finished, as what you said was so much to our liking. And now I will switch to the other official language of Finland, and say: Mrs Lindh, actual measures are what we need, and not just talk about objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought that a flying saucer was just about to take off.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, President of the Commission, in view of the generally illegible resolutions that Parliament is in the habit of adopting, let me formulate a few simple ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all a discovery: the European Union is not doing too badly. Of course, unemployment is still too high, but 2.5 million new jobs have been created. In 2000, we saw satisfactory economic growth and Europe became the pole of growth for the global economy. Inflation is lower in Europe than in the United States. Public deficits have been reduced. Salary increases have been in line with productivity gains. The internal market and the imminent launch of the euro will protect us even further against external shocks. Therefore, the US economic slow-down will affect us less than usual because trade exchanges between the fifteen Member States constitute nine tenths of our joint domestic product.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are deficits in Europe especially in new technologies, this being less marked for information technologies than for biotechnologies. In 2000, European investment in the ICT sector was higher than in the United States, even though some countries are still lagging well behind. The leading exporting force in the world, in 2000 the European Union achieved one fifth of its exports in the high tech sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Not everything is perfect in Europe, of course. We do not invest enough in education, training and lifelong learning. There is not enough investment in research. Our public spending is at the same level as in the United States and the private sector must make more effort. We can do better in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Stockholm must give the necessary impetus, particularly in employment and social affairs, as Mrs Lindh has just underlined. By making the right choices in Stockholm, we will be able to set a virtual circle in motion which will also benefit our partners in the rest of the world. Making the correct choices is not about choosing unbridled liberalisation and deregulation without regard for our social model and our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural reforms still need to be carried out; corporate and protectionist reflexes still need to be surmounted. It will not, however, be by demolishing a universal public service that we will obtain a better service and lower prices for consumers. Deregulation does not mean the lack of regulation. Deregulation always results in new rules, which do not always benefit consumers, as electricity consumers in California have just discovered. The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector above all has seen positive results because it took place at the same time as the technology revolution with mobile phones and the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The new economy has nevertheless experienced problems. Any new technology is just a tool. Simply prefixing an <span class="italic">e</span> to customary economic terms does not eliminate the long-established rules of supply and demand and of the need for profitability. The world’s stock markets are currently paying dearly for the lack of respect shown to elementary economic rules. The end to irrational exuberance on the financial markets paradoxically offers us the chance to turn our attention to the real economy and to influence the factors which are fundamental for the well-being of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will finish by saying, as President Prodi has just said, that the priority at Stockholm must be to invest in people, education, information and research into the infrastructures that we have for improving the quality of life.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lisbon established a process to run throughout this decade aimed at turning the European economy into the most competitive, best trained, and most socially balanced economy in the world. However, we note that, at least at the end of this first year, which takes us from Lisbon to Stockholm, there are very few tangible results.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not satisfied. We believe that, although the objectives were clearly established, we have neither made quick enough progress on the process of liberalisation, which should improve competition between markets, nor have we implemented the structural reforms necessary to better equip the infrastructures. Nor have we implemented the instruments necessary to become more competitive and to bring us into line, particularly with the United States, in terms of levels of training in areas in which we have the greatest advantage, that is to say technological development and scientific research.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we have to proceed much more quickly in these areas and we wish to focus on three fundamental questions which I will try to summarise in my few remaining seconds. Firstly, structural reforms and liberalisation. Secondly, incorporation and interest on the part of the private sector in the fields of high quality education and training. Thirdly, a significant reform of the labour market which, on the one hand, will promote the incorporation of workers and the least-favoured groups into the labour market and, on the other, will provide greater and better mobility in employment within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, I should like to address the following comments to you. It is clear that in Lisbon the European Union set itself a very ambitious objective, that of achieving a competitive economy. We support this project but we would like to draw your attention to the needs of our citizens. A genuine project for the 21st century must take on board the real needs of our citizens. I read in a newspaper yesterday that the mobile telephone market has reached saturation point with approximately 50 to 60 million surplus mobile telephones. Yet, in the European Union, not every citizen has the possibility of finding decent housing. Meeting the needs of our citizens is therefore crucial. In this respect, we also support the idea of environmental indicators and we deplore the fact that we will have to wait until the Barcelona European Council in 2002 before we actually have an integrated strategy. We wish your communication on sustainable development every success but we would like matters to proceed more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is about the instruments. Liberalising sectors is good but it must go hand in hand with obligations to provide services of general interest. From this perspective, and while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, we support the idea of the European Union having a framework directive on its obligations to provide public services of general interest, which is not the case at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final comment on the public finances you mentioned. I would ask you to pay attention, in the development of public spending, to the fact that there are perfectly legitimate areas of public spending, such as investment and education, which are <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> conditions if we want to meet the future challenges of society. The role of public authorities and public spending is therefore of paramount importance within the context of the Lisbon strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, they were characterised by a clearly right-wing financial policy of deregulation and privatisation and, on the other hand, by a left-wing policy of full employment, which thus, for the first time, became an official goal for the EU. There was talk of a social agenda, social cohesion, combating poverty, lifelong learning for all, etc., in other words natural elements of left-wing policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time I was very surprised. I wondered how it was possible to unite – or balance, as Mrs Lindh said – right-wing and left-wing policy at the same time. Now, the picture has become clearer, and I see that disagreement on financial policy remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Right-wing policy is clearly dominant ahead of the Stockholm Summit. The focus is on stability policy, liberalisation and deregulation of the internal market. The social profile is very weak. The Stockholm Summit was to have employment as its main issue, but there are no proposals for meaningful action to combat the major unemployment which currently affects 14 – 15 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">One aim is to encourage women to enter the workplace. This is good. Another aim is to increase employment of the older population, raise the retirement age, etc. However, the proposals are primarily aimed at increasing the level of employment, not at lowering unemployment. These are two different things. The 15 million people who are unemployed in Europe today but already count as part of the labour force will not benefit to any great degree from new groups joining that labour force.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group considers that this is very serious. The Swedish Government should naturally also be concerned but, unlike France and Portugal, it has chosen not to create its own profile but instead to implement what the Commission and the large Member States want as loyally as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">When, in the past, the Swedish Government was heading the campaign for Sweden to join the EU, it said the goal was not only to retain the Swedish welfare state but also, together with other left-wing forces, to pursue a social welfare policy throughout Europe. Now, we are heading in the opposite direction. Right-wing policy is promoted in the EU, and the Swedish welfare policy is at risk. This is taking place despite the fact that the economy is sound, despite a majority of left-wing governments in the Council and despite a left-wing majority in the Swedish Parliament. Not even given optimum conditions have we in the last year approached a social Europe. What will happen if the economic situation deteriorates and the Council gains more right-wing governments?</p>
<p class="contents">Time has run out for the Swedish Presidency. To conclude, I wonder whether there really is nothing which the Swedish Government could prioritise ahead of the coming employment summit for those who are unemployed here and now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union must continue to implement uniform and rights-led programmes of education relating to new information technologies, so that all citizens of the Union can be properly integrated into the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">This presents us with two challenges. First, those who are unskilled and lack the necessary training or educational qualifications must be given new opportunities. I am referring in particular to the young and long-term unemployed still concentrated in certain urban and rural areas of the European Union. The European Union Social Fund is a key financial mechanism which has been used very effectively, particularly in Objective 1 regions, to provide new training opportunities for the unskilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is equally important that the existing workforce is retrained in the skills demanded by new and changing information technologies. Benefits can accrue for business from the use of the Internet and the related e-commerce opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly the Commission, Parliament and Member States' governments have all worked closely together to ensure that the Stockholm Summit will be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall that the Nice Council before Christmas set out a number of guidelines for new social policy measures. EU leaders want to promote more and better jobs and worker mobility, anticipate and manage change in the working environment, combat poverty, exclusion and discrimination, modernise social protection systems and promote equality. They also want to focus on the external implications of employment and social policies, particularly in relation to the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been at the forefront of promoting these measures. The Union has an unemployment rate of 8% and the target of full employment is attainable. Those who say that it is not must not be listened to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These Member States have indicated that the European Commission must think of a strategy which will lead to the European Union rubbing shoulders with the greatest in the global bio-industry and biotechnological research.</p>
<p class="contents">However promising the results of biotechnology may be, an ethical boundary remains necessary. In January 1998, we held a debate on the Council of Europe’s Protocol, which included a ban on cloning humans. I then expressed the fear that countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which then refused to sign the protocol, probably did not want the ban to be so stringent.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2000, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom gave the green light to the therapeutic cloning of human embryos in laboratories. Although reproductive cloning is not permitted, research carries on. There is the danger that permitting therapeutic cloning will leave the door open to the discussion on reproductive cloning. The argument will then be that, at the end of the day, the same technique is already being applied, only for a different purpose. There is a doctor in Italy who already wants to clone people reproductively, and 60 volunteers have already come forward for this experiment.</p>
<p class="contents">I see each new human life as a gift of God. Every form of human life must be treated with due respect. That is also the only way to protect human dignity. The use of human embryos as consumer items, in the so-called name of research, is hence something that goes against the grain as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In the discussion on human genetics, I call on the Council to maintain the ban on therapeutic cloning, as already expressed by the European Parliament in September 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is almost impossible to discuss this issue in this arena. I wonder whether Mr Suominen’s statement regarding ‘not words but deeds’ also applies to you? What sanctions do you impose on people sabotaging this system? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Open coordination has been chosen as the method, and I would like to share my experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden has taken part in a number of summits and processes. Ever since the Essen Summit of 1994, there has been talk of the importance of lowering taxes on work and increasing flexibility. In practice, Sweden has done the opposite. Just as with its self-imposed exclusion on the question of the euro, it ignores what has been jointly decided. Instead, the tax burden is increased and entrepreneurs continue to be hampered. In Stockholm, we must make comparisons and learn from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">So how will that work? It is true that there is talk of increased employment but the truth in Sweden is that, despite three years of economic growth, more people remain outside the workforce than was the case in the early 1990s when we experienced the worst recession since the Second World War. At the same time, real unemployment is hidden by labour market policy and temporary mass training initiatives which do not lead to quality jobs. Furthermore, the statistics include a frightening rate of sick leave. If we add latent job-seekers and the under-employed, unemployment in Sweden covers 17% of the workforce – compared with the official statistic of 5%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Document talked a great deal about knowledge. Despite all the talk of lifelong learning, in terms of knowledge, Sweden risks meltdown as we are failing right from the start. 34% of young people in upper secondary schools lack satisfactory qualifications in mathematics, Swedish and English. At the same time, raising quality within education through independent schools and increased competition is being thwarted – exactly contrary to the intentions in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Swedish universities are in crisis. It is true that Sweden has many people with degrees, but it lacks people with real cutting-edge expertise. Therefore, the socialists are lowering taxes for rich specialists that have been flown in and raising taxes for permanently resident, poorly-educated Swedes.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking and planning is one thing – especially if you can do it in a meeting room somewhere else in Europe – but implementing and changing requires greater conviction. Power to act is needed now, not least for national structural reforms and increased liberalisation at EU level. Instead of devoting myself to meaningless compromises and fine words, I intend to continue to criticise the European model, which has so far not been able to create many new jobs but instead sentences far too many people to long-term unemployment, social exclusion, poverty and marginalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic indicators are good, but this objective will not achieve itself and it will not implement itself. We must have the courage to set decisive priorities. Lisbon gave us clear guidelines within which to find the courage to set decisive priorities and move forward using a method of open coordination between the Member States. These guidelines are clear and unequivocal. They mean investing in people and in their skills and we have good cause to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we talk of the new opportunities offered by information and communications technologies and of the millions of jobs which they can create. But on the other hand, fewer than 22% of our employees are given specific training. We talk of the opportunities of a new European labour market and mobility for the young generation, but we stop short of creating the right conditions for it in our schools and on our vocational training programmes. We talk of already having bottlenecks on the specialist job markets, but we seem unable to implement a specific integration policy to help the unemployed – and there are well over 14 million in the European Union – make their own contribution to the working population.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Mr President of the Commission, and I ask you, Madam President-in-Office: there has been talk here of the stability pact, which was supposedly a success. Why are we unable to apply the same rigour, the same clear method of open coordination so as to ensure that every young person on the European labour market has a suitable chance to get started in a new European future? That is the brief for Stockholm, that is the brief for the following summit, which is precisely why Stockholm must not degenerate into a one-sided liberalisation summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the balance spoken of here is in jeopardy, which is why I call on you, Madam President-in-Office, to summon up the strength and courage in the Swedish Presidency to put the integrated policy of economic reform, social cohesion and job promotion which we welcomed into practice. This is precisely why we need clear, uncompromising interim objectives, both for the employment process and for the new public budget guidelines.</p>

That emphasis recognises what is already clear. Despite the gradual increase in economic growth within the Union over the years, there are still millions of people who have not benefited. Indeed, in some Member States, such as my own, which have tended to follow the American model, the gap between rich and poor has been widening. We are also seeing significant numbers of working poor, those who have jobs but cannot afford to live on their wages. There is a still a huge gap between the incomes of men and women, which continues into old age and must be an important issue in the discussion on pensions. Growth alone is not the solution to social deprivation and it never has been. Distribution and equality of opportunity are also important, hence the need to include social criteria alongside the economic goals and the use of appropriate indicators to look at the combined effect.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have heard, however, Stockholm will not just deal with the Lisbon follow-up. It will be a first step towards explaining how the European Union is going to deliver on sustainable development. It is obvious to us that unless we factor the environment into our economic thinking there will no chance of having a sustainable economy. We have to find an economic path that does not strip the world of its natural resources and produce toxic or greenhouse emissions. That means we have to look at the quality of the economic growth we seek and not just the amount. If 3% growth depends on depleting fish stocks, increasing car travel or cleaning up after crime, it is not the sort of growth that improves the quality of life or quality of the environment for anyone. It is not sustainable and that is why we have urged the use of appropriate environmental indicators alongside the social and economic ones. We can then adopt a coherent approach to sustainable development and see if we really are achieving the results we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The crisis in food production, incorporating the collapse of stock-rearing and the distribution, processing and sale of meat is a priority issue, as are consumer anxiety and apprehension about the consequences of eating food contaminated by disease, deterioration or adulteration. There is the ever-increasing scandal of food fraud, and mass distribution has an enormous responsibility for guaranteeing the distribution of food that is safe for consumers to eat and for preventing the systematic destruction of the whole of small and medium-sized distribution – which is an essential factor for local speciality products and preserving jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We are wondering, too, whether Stockholm will mark the birth of the Food Safety Agency, announced long ago and always postponed, and we put forward the city of Parma as the most appropriate candidate for its location.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also wondering about safety with regard to the use of wholly or partly genetically modified foods, and about the weight of that problem with regard to baby foods, pharmaceutical products or products on general sale such as vitamins or integrators containing animal gelatines.</p>
<p class="contents">Other questions relate to scientific research into BSE, the disposal of tens of thousands of animal carcasses, slaughtered and burned, or slaughtering methods that often fail to show even minimal respect for the animals themselves and the environment; and again, natural catastrophes, often not so natural, when bridges collapse, houses crumble and rivers burst their banks, destroying men and property because the people who built them were negligent and disregarded the law and the safety of the territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stockholm Summit should address all those issues along with other factors, such as the on-going unregulated use of the Internet, at least as far as the European Union is concerned. Regulation is needed to guarantee that the network is about freedom and not about abuse and violence, as in sites promoting paedophilia, drug trafficking and so on. The record companies and the economy have closed Napster down. When will the European governments close down the paedophile sites? And last but not least, there is the pollution of the Mediterranean and other seas.</p>
<p class="contents">And we wonder if the Stockholm Council will at least take an interest in the slump in the new market and the consequences for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The postal services are one example of just how inefficient Council meetings are. It was decided in Lisbon to speed up the liberalisation of postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">We adopted our position in the European Parliament before the end of the year, in the hope that the Council would adopt its common position by the end of the year. What happened? Not a thing! The Council did not adopt a common position. We should in fact admit to ourselves that the Council does not want to adopt a common position. Germany has decided to extend the post office monopoly because everything has ground to a halt in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, we call on you to ensure at the Stockholm Summit that the Heads of State and Government instruct their ministers to proceed with the liberalisation of postal services without delay. Only this will prove that Council meetings make any sense or any headway.</p>
<p class="contents">And then you should pass a second resolution, Madam President-in-Office, stating that the Heads of State and Government must evaluate structural policy, post haste. We must be in a position to reform structural policy in 2003 at the latest, for two reasons. Firstly, because structural policy is extremely important to labour market policy in numerous countries and, secondly, because we have to tell candidate countries what to expect in the new period if they accede after 2005/2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Madam President-in-Office, please make sure that the summit passes specific resolutions on the liberalisation of postal services and the evaluation of the structural funds so that we can make headway for the period after 2006.

Yesterday afternoon, during Questions to the Commission, there was a Question No 91 from the Spanish People’s Party MEP, Mrs García-Orcoyen. The last question answered during those Questions to the Commission was Question No 61.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, certain sections of the Spanish press are publishing the ‘question’ and the supposed reply from Commissioner Wallström. This morning, after becoming aware of this information, the Socialist Group made a written request to the Parliamentary services to issue that reply. At 11.28 this morning we received the following written reply from the services of this House:</p>
<p class="contents">‘I must inform you that the reply to the said question from Mrs García-Orcoyen, which was communicated to us when Question Time had ended, is awaiting translation. Once translated and sent officially to the author you will be sent a copy by e-mail. Signed: João Correa’.</p>
<p class="contents">How is it possible, Mr President, that we MEPs do not have the reply – and nor did the author of the question – when it is already in the hands of the press, not only the supposed reply, but also an explanatory communication of the response from the Spanish People’s Party, explaining it? Mr President, this is the second time in one month that something like this has happened and supposed replies are being leaked to the Spanish media before the MEPs themselves – and, I repeat, even the authors of the questions – have heard the reply. How can this happen? Is it pure chance that on these two occasions the supposed reply supports the positions of the Spanish Government? Does the Spanish Government have a mole somewhere in the Commission or in Parliament? Mr President, as an MEP, I would ask you for protection for Parliament and respect for MEPs.</p>
