If we want more from Barcelona than a poor compromise cobbling together 15 national views, then we in the European Parliament need to be more ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need to develop the market areas which support our citizens and businesses. We must ensure that the cost of electricity is fair and transparent and is not influenced by the status quo and the power of existing utilities. Unfortunately, not all of my colleagues share my vision. Importantly, there are some who wish to reintroduce negotiated access. This option was removed by the Commission to increase market transparency. It was blamed for blocking new entrants to the German market. This is a test case which will establish the direction in which we want to take the new electricity market – forwards to greater transparency, or backwards to the days where national incumbents dominated the market. A fundamental part of a truly transparent European market is ownership unbundling of the transmission system. We must have the full separation of transmission from other parts of the energy network. Without this, cross-sector subsidies and unfair competition will never end; this is an essential part of the reform package.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no fair competition without powerful and independent regulatory bodies. The role and powers of regulatory authorities must be increased and their scope broadened in order to match the growing economic power of large utilities. In Spain and Germany duopolies dominate the market, while in France EDF remains unchallenged on the domestic market. This dominant position can not only influence government policy too greatly, but also prevent new entrants from accessing the market. Electricity release obligations are a powerful and necessary instrument that regulators should have to end this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the economic power of some big companies in Europe is expanding through unfair distortion. E.ON, RWE and EDF are buying up in other countries using money from decommissioning funds in their own countries. London Electricity, PowerGen, Innogy and others have been bought up with this money. If we do not end this situation now, rather than in two or three years, there will be no more competitors in a market in which we want to see a high degree of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also support informed choice for our customers. We need labelling. The EU should not fall behind the US, Australia and New Zealand, which have all opened up their markets and linked them to full disclosure of information. Opening up the market must include measures to increase the powers of small consumers. The UK's Energywatch has been extremely effective in bringing down prices for small and large consumers alike.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish with some words to my French colleagues.</p>

The law we are drafting will completely overhaul the market in energy, which is one of the key markets in Europe, one that is worth billions, and we allow each rapporteur to speak for just five minutes – five minutes in which we really cannot make any sensible points. That, then, we even have to divide up again between the two rapporteurs, because, strictly speaking, we have only one directive, but its two dossiers mean that there are two rapporteurs. The Commissioner, who is just entering the Chamber, will then have the opportunity to say something, provided it is something amusing! There is no doubt about it, I do not begrudge her that, but our having to limit ourselves in political debate in such a way strikes me as positively catastrophic.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just said that we are going to change the structures of the market. What we actually have in the European Union is not an internal market; rather, we have 15 submarkets which, in themselves, are more or less open, but which vary widely as to their degree of openness. That is still much more the case in the market for gas than in the market for electricity. If, though, we want to exploit the efficiency gains of an internal market, then what we need is not the addition of 15 submarkets, but an integrated, common, internal market. Efficiency gains to enable business – especially small and medium-sized enterprises – to improve its competitiveness, efficiency gains for consumers in terms of favourable prices, and efficiency gains for the environment, gained through the careful use of resources. The open market that we want is not a matter of ‘laissez-faire<span class="italic">’ </span>or of everyone doing as they please. We need rules for all the participants in this integrated market, rules that they can make sense of, rules that they can apply in a similar manner. We need, then, the access of all market participants to the networks and other system installations to be utterly transparent and free of discrimination, as otherwise distortions of competition will come into being.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need a unitary regulatory framework, such as we do not as yet possess, the consequence of that being that we have a divided market and a system that in practice works virtually nowhere, with the possible exception of in one Member State in an island situation; it is not yet working anywhere else. We need a regulatory framework that sets objectives, lays down binding standards, and creates machinery and applicability across the board. Our problem is now that we have, of course, 15 different Member States, and the structures of these 15 Member States differ widely. The overall conditions of a country with 700 or more network operators are quite different from those of a Member State with only one network. What matters, though, is that the regulatory framework should have binding effect, with its application being monitored and with sanctions being imposed in the event of non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what is at stake, and, that being so, we must correct some of what the Commission originally proposed in its amending directive in order, on the one hand, that the objectives of the different systems in the Member States should be standardised, and, on the other, that their home-grown structures should remain compatible to some small degree. How the institutions and authorities in a Member State then guarantee that this happens<span class="italic"> </span>is a matter for the Member State itself. All that is needed is for it to be clear and reliable for all participants in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for what we, as legislators, can actually regulate. I want to use the seconds remaining to me just to ask the Commission for something. It so happens that we currently have different conditions applying to electricity and gas respectively. On the whole, we produce electricity ourselves in the internal market. For gas, we are increasingly dependent on imports from third countries. I believe that, from the competition and competitiveness angle, we will have the important task of introducing competition among producers. I know this is a problematic issue, as the suppliers are generally from outside the EU, but this would be a task on which, as a whole, we would have to work together, as, without supply-side competition of this kind, we will never have more than restricted competition in the European market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the committee's rapporteur, may I say that the committee supports the Commission's proposal for a regulation. Cross-border trading must finally get underway so that producers can supply other Member States, enabling competition to be introduced between existing suppliers across the EU. There are five preconditions for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the networks which operate the transit flows need to have their costs reimbursed from a fund. Secondly, it will only work if the same conditions apply throughout Europe, that is if there is regulation. Thirdly, both producers and consumers have to pay into the fund. Fourthly, these producer payments need to be standardised in the Member States to avoid any party being at a competitive advantage. Fifthly, there must be no internal duties, so no payments by so-called importers and exporters – which are in any case an odd concept in an internal market – and there must be no distance-related tariffs. What counts here is physics and not the law.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three concluding comments on this issue. The place where the electricity is generated is significant. This depends on many factors. The committee will no doubt be flexible, even if additional so-called price signals, which meet the criteria that I have mentioned, are developed and applied. In Florence, the regulators, the networks and the Commission are of course reflecting on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee is not proposing to change the competences in the comitology procedure or in the fora. Since this is codecision, however, we propose that the situation be reviewed after four years to ascertain whether the procedure advocated here meets the requirements of codecision. After all, the regulators in the Member States and the experts, for example the network operators, should be involved in a regulatory process.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation should not come into force before the directives which also legislate on changes in the electricity and gas markets.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second subject. Here I should like to make a few comments not in my capacity as rapporteur but as a member of the committee, and specifically, Madam Vice-President, for you to take with you to Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Member of the Council which still only wants partial market opening – and we know exactly which one this is – is in contravention of the Treaties. I should like to make this absolutely clear here and it is also in the committee's motion for a resolution. These Treaties guarantee all EU citizens the freedom of establishment, the freedom to provide services and the freedom of movement of goods across the EU. These freedoms will only be implemented once all electricity and gas consumers are able to select their suppliers from across the EU. Only then will we have achieved conformity with the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if a Member State wishes to treat all the households in its country equally – for example all those between Lille and the Pyrenees – it may do so; it is free to make that decision. However, it can invite tenders for the work and ask which competitor is the most suitable and best qualified for the job. A supply monopoly cannot be justified. This too violates current law. It lends credence to the suspicion that people are lining their pockets illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might make the following additional points on the reports. We support free choice for all consumers across the EU. We are in favour of all suppliers having access to the technical networks, which need to be managed in separate companies to prevent discrimination against certain types of supplier and to prevent abuse of dominant position within a company. We are in favour of having regulatory systems in the Member States to ensure that this is the case. So far – and here I fully agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Rapkay – this has not been satisfactorily resolved in any Member State. Like the Council I support a solution which takes account of the heterogeneity of the national network structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the same position and unanimously approved my opinion and my amendments, almost all of which were included by the rapporteurs in their reports, for which I thank them.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevailing view, I think, is that the liberalisation of the internal market in electricity and natural gas is: one, way behind schedule and is being systematically obstructed by monopoly interests on the part of the private sector, the trades union and the national governments, and not just in France; two, that there are huge differences from one country to another. For example, Great Britain has fully liberalised, while France is doing exactly the opposite and the same applies, unfortunately, to my own country; three, as a result of the foregoing, there are serious disruptions in the working of the internal market, competition is being distorted and, consequently, prices are being squeezed at the expense of competitiveness both in the energy production sector and between European companies and in the consumer sector and, four, this delay is hampering cross-border transactions on these markets. There is no single market, nor do I foresee one in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon objectives of a dynamic and competitive European Union with full employment depend on a competitive internal market in electricity and natural gas. And the proposed independent authorities and the abolition of state intervention, which uses pricing policy as a way of exercising social policy will help here somewhat. Instead of prices which undercut production costs and block competition, it is better to find other ways of exercising social policy, for example by reducing taxes. Finally, any delay in opening up these markets will deter private companies and foreign investment in the energy sector and in the European Union in general and will not therefore increase employment, which is supposed to be the ultimate objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This committee was of the opinion that it was preferable to include the annexes in the regulation and the directive so as to create clarity, and to safeguard public access to legislative documents. This appears all the more justified since the annexes contain a number of regulations which protect the end user.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the gas directive, the great importance of effective and non-discriminatory access to natural gas production markets for all operators in the European energy industry should be underlined. By extending the principles of the internal energy market to countries which possess raw materials, producer countries can be developed and the internal market objectives met.<span class="italic"> </span>The gradual and mutual harmonisation of legislation is crucial for the internal energy market to reach completion. A common minimum framework of standards must be available by means of which the regulatory bodies of the energy markets can be granted authority and given responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should like to underline that the sole purpose of gathering information on companies, both at Member State level and at Commission level, is solely to fulfil the tasks prescribed in this regulation and this directive. Since this information is partly confidential, restrictions on the distribution of the information obtained are urgently required.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that the present directive amends a whole host of regulations in the existing directive, and it appears useful to me to seize this opportunity to publish a consolidated version. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a long time now it has been clear that the energy issue plays a central role, above and beyond security of supply. It is inextricably linked to the fate of our generation and future generations. The rapporteurs recognised this and have extended the Commission proposal to make it more forward-looking.</p>
<p class="contents">Slowly but surely, more and more people are realising that the future lies in renewable sources of energy. They are the only sources which will guarantee a clean and secure energy supply in the long term. That is why we need to lay down some ground rules for these renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important point here is that the true cost of supplying all energy is reflected in its price. To achieve this, when energy is supplied from traditional nuclear and fossil fuel sources, the external costs for insurance and the subsequent costs in terms of pollutant emissions need to be internalised. We need undiscriminatory access to the networks for electricity and also for biogas. This is a new concept which has been accepted here for the first time. We need fair transmission charges for all sources of energy and in a free market we also need the primary energy sources to be labelled. We owe this to our consumers. I would even go so far as to say that it is not only bills that should be labelled; energy sources should also be disclosed in the energy supplier's promotional literature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is on today’s agenda? On today’s agenda is a fresh step for Parliament in the process of total liberalisation. And after the successful first opening we have had, it is important to take that second step. We would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Commissioner and the Member States to ensure that this is achieved in Barcelona and that we do not try to frustrate the process, as we usually do – and you know which Member State I am referring to. As Mr Mombaur has already indicated the principal arguments, I will not elaborate on these any further.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the key points? Firstly, we must ensure that a level playing field is established. In other words, we must remove obstacles and ensure that everyone is given equal opportunities. Secondly, we need to ensure that the role of the supervisors is framed in such a manner that we ultimately work towards a single European market. This is why Amendments Nos 53 and 130 to Article 6(1) of the directive are of prime importance. My group is keen to see these amendments adopted, because we can thereby ensure that we work towards this single European market. The third key point is that we can allow competition actually to take place, thus ensuring transparency and non-discrimination. After all, we have seen that the instrument of reciprocity does not work. The consumer must have free choice. My final point is this: it is of great strategic importance for us to start with an assemblage of information. We are keen to support the amendment that is now before us by Mr Westendorp, among others. We have nothing against the Mombaur report, but we struggle all the more with the report by Mr Turmes. Allow me to say at this stage that the PPE-DE Group will request a split vote for Amendment No 69 and will withdraw Amendment No 181, so that there will be no question of negotiated third-party access.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, we have great difficulty with the Turmes report. In our view, it contains too many rules, too great an administrative burden and too little respect for the market economy. We also believe it is not right for responsibility to lie with industry and not with the supervisors or national States. I should like to note that liberalisation is not promoted in this way, but that new obstacles are raised, so that it is difficult for liberalisation to get off the ground. And this could never be the intention.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we must carefully consider the environmental aspects. However, we should bear in mind that with regard to combined heat and power production and telecommunications, we can regulate many of the points on this topic in other directives too. We would therefore urge Mr Turmes to withdraw amendments in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the debate or discussion about these directives and regulations has been a good example of how together we can get to grips with a complicated issue at least enough to know where we concur and where our views differ.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I should like to recall that at the end of the eighties, when the Commission published its White Paper on the internal market, energy was not even mentioned, which shows that we are dealing with an extremely complicated matter here. At the time there were many who said, hands off, that is far too complicated, we in the electricity and gas industry understand this much better, let us deal with it. We chose another route and I believe that competition is indeed the right way forward. I am also in favour of our establishing unrestricted competition. Incidentally, if we did not do this, in the end the European Court of Justice would probably force us to change the way we do certain things, for example to recognise that the customer is the domestic customer and not a customer defined by us. You see the Treaty always carries more weight than any Parliament resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, also like to advocate that we not only deregulate, but also regulate. What we are doing here is actually regulated deregulation, if I am allowed to say that. But that is precisely what it is. We are not only opening up the market in gas and electricity, we are also setting the conditions – the environmental and social conditions – under which this will take place, or we are leaving it up to the Member States to do so by enacting their own regulations. I believe that these are two sides of the same coin. This is perhaps where we differ, Mr van Velzen, in our assessment of these directives. Neither do I regard this as complicating the process; I think it is part of it. We need a market and we need regulated competition, but energy is also something to which the public has a right. Security of supply must be established and the environmental conditions must be set. This is an integral part of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening up of the energy markets is also a fundamental prerequisite for the functioning of the Kyoto Protocol. Without competition and without an open market, we will not be able to have emissions trading in Europe. This is part of the Kyoto Protocol, which, after all, almost all of us wish to ratify. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good choice, but the problem lies in a single question: ‘How are we going to create this market?’</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission’s new directive is regulated competition. The main assessment criterion we should use is whether or not there is a balance between competition and regulation, that is, whether or not the fundamental rights to a public service, environmental quality and security of supply are taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The goals of many of my fellow Members in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy remain within the proposals made by the Commission. Their sole objective is to speed up liberalisation and create a level playing field. Others have tried to pave the way for a regulation of general interest. Claude Turmes and Bernhard Rapkay have carried out significant work to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, however, there is an imbalance between the choice of effective competition and the requirements of society. This imbalance is unacceptable. That is the <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> of our strategic Amendment No 177 which aims to oblige the Member States to fulfil both their obligations regarding competition and increased, more effective obligations of general interest. We do not agree with the attitude of the French State which opposes the opening up of its domestic market while the French public operator is buying market shares elsewhere. However, the compromise it is asking for today, which consists of establishing freedom for non-domestic customers to choose their supplier, while being able to retain a reserved sector for domestic customers, is a good one, in particular if this means equal tariffs throughout national territory. Those in favour of the market have not presented any economic argument to justify the obligation to open the market to small customers at all costs, even though this could result in additional inconvenience and cost rather than freedom. Common sense would dictate that a principle of diversity be respected. With regard to the obligation on competition, strong pressure is being exerted in countries like France or Germany, where the traditional operators are powerful and well-established. The requirement for transparency is justified, as is the requirement to set up an independent regulatory body. However, ownership unbundling, or the separation of transport and distribution, amongst others, threatens to destroy effective groups. Making room for new players in the renewable energies market is justified. Attacking the nuclear industry and the national assets of our neighbours is not.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it shocking that certain advocates of competition are opposed to Community legislation in the field of market access. The TPA negotiated actually represents the closure of the German market. Others are demanding reciprocal market access, even though this contradicts the very notion of the large market and stirs up ill-feeling. On the contrary, we believe that the European Union, that is to say the Commission, the Council, Parliament, organised European civil society, must take on tasks of general interest and regulation duties. Otherwise simple competition would be dogged by increasing national conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Completion of the internal market in electricity and gas is something which will impact on each and every one of the 370 million consumers right across the European Union. As co-legislators in this area, we have a great responsibility to get things right and to ensure that the end result is one which brings about a fair deal for all.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, I can inform colleagues that work is well under way to achieve this aim. Formal opening of the Irish electricity market has exceeded the requirements of Directive 96/62/EC. In fact, the Irish national authorities are already putting in place a model of market opening which has much to recommend it, separating as it does operation from ownership of the assets. This model effectively separates ownership interests from planning decisions, which helps overall efficiency. It may not be the model which suits every Member State, but it has clear advantages in a small state where certain economies of scale are required in order to deliver the lowest cost and the most efficient production to end-users.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that efficient, cheap and sustainable energy production is a key element in achieving our goal. The rapporteurs in the committee have done us proud in dealing with this complex and technical issue in a comprehensive and balanced manner and in working to a very demanding timetable in order to complete this very important dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the very brief amount of time available to me, I would like to confirm our support for the more stringent measures proposed by the Commission – Article 86 of the Treaty – and push for a majority vote. There are countries such as France, which have a genuine conflict of interests in this sector. The French Government owns EDF so it has every reason to want to maintain the asymmetries in the market which allow EDF to go and take over market segments elsewhere, exploiting its monopoly position and the closed nature of the internal market. That is why I feel that we must go all the way and push for a majority vote at Barcelona too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also regret that the timetable has now been compressed from May to March because of the Council's desire to have this proposal before it at Barcelona. I hope this will not be a case of 'legislate in haste and repent at leisure'.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly support the aims of the directive and the regulation. The present situation is a flawed and inequitable market. French and German utilities are able to buy UK power companies, yet it is impossible to have reciprocal opportunities to buy into EDF or acquire whole companies. The German market is almost as difficult to enter, despite so-called full competition. This must change.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that the step-by-step approach is a realistic one: first all non-domestic consumers then domestic later, as a progressive opening, is a more orderly process. I have to regret that one rapporteur has chosen to introduce too much detail in amendments and tried to over-elaborate some of the measures, for example, the question of the detail demanded on energy bills. This is an unnecessary amount of detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to commend the proposed amendments on establishing a committee of European energy regulators so as to improve cooperation and coordination in implementing the regulation on cross-border trading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the Union was established as a single market, this market only functions in part. Many Member States have actually become expert at protecting their markets, monopolies and cartels. The Nordic countries have liberalised both the electricity and the telecommunications markets, and the consumer has benefited: prices are low. The large Member States, in particular, often pay little heed to jointly agreed rules, and the insistence on unanimity with regard to decisions is a shield behind which they withdraw. As the Commission has neither the authority nor the courage to intervene when there is malpractice, the market does not work. The situation harms solidarity and must end. Some, then, are for liberalisation while others are for maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true we might ask whether market liberalism is justified from the point of view of public service obligations. However, we need common rules, which should also be monitored. The same lack of solidarity has prevailed in the telecommunications sector. Cross-border transmission tariffs and overload control are important matters. Only actual costs should apply for access to the network, and then competition is possible and the consumer benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is satisfied with the basic approach outlined in Mr Mombaur’s report. Nevertheless, the Commission’s scope for monitoring is not made sufficiently clear, and this awkward and unfair situation is likely to continue. We clearly highlighted this in the end in the framework legislation for the telecommunications sector, and it will benefit consumers in Europe. The Union must therefore be reformed in such a way that Member States cannot at the same time both prevent competition and muscle in on the situation in other countries, buying up local energy companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, it is vital for long-term contracts for gas transport to be safeguarded, given the increase in demand for gas, partly as a result of the planned closure of nuclear plants, and given that important investments, for example in piping, which are indispensable to the EU’s gas supply, are necessary. The gas supply is literally at stake here.</p>

Failing to heed negative experiences of similar processes, as in the case of California, for example, the report insists on the need to open up and liberalise these strategic sectors, and to make them more competitive in order to satisfy the interests of various economic groups, even with the knowledge that they are thereby endangering fundamental aspects of a universal public service: the right to the supply of high-quality energy at a reasonable price and the commitment to develop alternative and renewable forms of energy.</p>

The Commission tabled a comprehensive proposal to make this desire a reality. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy enriched this proposal by including other relevant points, stressing the need for greater emphasis on renewable sources of energy and the right of all suppliers to have unrestricted access to the network. The Committee also beefs up the role of the independent regulatory authorities and counters possible distortions of competition with provisions on ownership unbundling. I am in favour of these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 43 to the report. Here electricity providers are required to disclose to the final consumer the composition of the energy mix supplied in the bill and in advertising materials.

I was pleased to see that the rapporteurs identified this as a key point. In our view, it is important that the benefits are not offset by new taxes and that we create a system which guarantees a sustainable and secure energy supply, in terms of both the environment and business management. Just as I will decide this lunchtime whether to eat a schnitzel or a salad, thus determining the energy supply for my personal energy balance, in the future I also want to take advantage of the free movement of goods to be able to decide whether to have solar power or hydroelectric power. But perhaps it will not only be a choice between one or the other; it would be nice if I could say, in the future I want to be able to use 50% solar power and 50% hydroelectric power in my private house or in my company. Here I attach the utmost importance to there being no cross-subsidisation. In particular, for instance, we do not want the final disposal of nuclear waste to be cross-subsidised from other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want a universal service and compliance with public service and environmental obligations; this will of course be achieved through public calls for tender, so that good service is guaranteed and efficiency is central.</p>
<p class="contents">An external certified body should be responsible for assessing quality in the electricity sector. In the future, you see, we also want renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy-saving measures to be focal points. In the future, there must not be any discrimination in the network price on the basis of quantity of electricity or method of generation.

They are essential to compliance with the Lisbon objectives if we really want to build the most competitive economy in the world, and they are also essential to the liberalisation of the internal market. To sum up, they are of benefit to the consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a complex subject. We have had to separate two directives – the one on gas and the one on electricity – and we have had to do a lot of work very quickly.

<p class="contents">Because of the complexity of the subject, there have been attempts to postpone the vote which is going to take place tomorrow.

The stated aim is to encourage business activities in a sector which until recently, because it was under state control, was closed to the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The transmission systems are, to all intents and purposes, administered by government agencies which only have to break even, while the private companies which use them will pitch their prices so that they can reap the maximum possible profit. This is just one example of the favours being done to the private sector. In Greece, the Public Power Corporation is forced to buy electricity at a loss from private companies, just so that they can enter the market. Liberalisation ignores social requirements, such as supplying electricity to islands and other inaccessible areas, and is causing obvious difficulties with long-term planning. The argument that prices are falling does not stand up, given that the fully liberalised markets in Germany and the United Kingdom charge consistently higher prices than the partially liberalised Greek market.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the amendments increase the intervention of the European Commission is also a very serious matter. To sum up, the only ones who stand to gain from the new arrangements are the large monopolies, which will penetrate the markets still further, with the help of the regulation on cross-border transactions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ideals of fairness, asceticism and non-profit making have fallen, unable to contend with such a weak market: this has led to abuse, an increase in wastage, privileges, bureaucracy and inequality and, at the same time, falling profits. As a result, we are turning back rapidly – it is to be hoped – to competition, to the market, to the prevailing interest of the consumer and also to the profit-making of private enterprise, which is no longer seen as a negative thing.</p>

Security of supply, territorial cohesion, network and interconnection development, plant renovation and public service obligations are all essential aspects that involve long-term investment without immediate profitability but which must be guaranteed, if we are to avoid replicating the California crisis. This sector must therefore be closely monitored and a balance maintained between market mechanisms and other imperatives and factors in market organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members here advocate opening up to competition. However, when we look at the situation in the various countries, we see that the legislative framework is one thing and the reality of opening is another. Germany, for example, is in theory 100% open, but less than 3% of its electricity is imported. Perhaps it would be better to allow for opening to take place more slowly in order to be able to fulfil our commitments. From this perspective, the date of 1 January 2003 put forward by the Commission for opening with regard to all non-domestic customers is unrealistic and does not even allow time for countries to adopt transposing legislation, where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has suggested a period of 24 months after adoption of the directive. In addition to this, along the lines of Amendment No 177 which Mr Herzog has already mentioned, we have asked that the other factors in the organisation of the sector, public service obligation, security of supply, promotion of renewable energy sources, safety of installations and environmental protection be guaranteed operational at the time of opening.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to domestic customers, households, we must take account of the fact that in some countries, equal tariffs are a key element of public services. Whether the customer lives in the country, in an isolated valley or in a town, they are charged the same price per kW/hour. This is considered part of equal access to public services.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we propose that those Member States who so wish be allowed to retain a sector which is not open to competition so that equal tariffs remain possible and equal access to public energy services continues to be a reality in our countries. I hope that the Council will take this into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to ask the Commissioner when we are likely to see a situation when an English-owned company will be able to sell electricity to the French Prime Minister. Until that situation is reached, the idea of an internal market in energy is a political mirage.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a lot of comment about the pressure under which this debate is taking place. When the Commission's proposals first came out, it was the view of the British Government that they could be accepted as they stood. We have managed to bring in hundreds of amendments, which says a lot for the fertile imagination of Parliament. We make a bit of a rod for our own backs at times. By trying to bring in issues such as energy efficiency, renewable energy and social issues we complicate the matter further, these are better left for other types of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two points. On independent regulation, we regard this as essential if an internal market is to develop, because it provides the predictability and stability which consumers and new entrants need; but it should be for the Member State to reflect the different structures of national markets. On the question of third-party access to infrastructure, market entrants need to know that they can access infrastructure on the same terms as those that already exist. And they should be approved by the national regulator, rather than be the subject of one-sided negotiations between a monopoly infrastructure operator and a potential user. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The press suggests that Barcelona will determine whether energy liberalisation takes place at all or not, and yet I do not see Mr Blair, Mr Aznar or other prime ministers here. This is an important point: the liberalisation of the energy sector, one of the last components of the single market yet to be subject to single-market disciplines, is a legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">We must assert our fundamental role in that legislative process. This legislation will go through to second reading well after the political pyrotechnics of Barcelona are long forgotten. It is essential, therefore, that at first reading we establish the principles of the legislation so that at second reading we can indeed push through a proper liberalising energy package.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Chichester referred earlier to the need to get the details right. He is absolutely correct. In that spirit I have two specific questions for the EPP-ED Group, which has been keen to promote itself as the liberal voice on this issue and yet, I fear, may be voting quite differently tomorrow. Firstly, will the EPP-ED Group support the amendment adopted in committee to make sure that nuclear decommissioning funds cannot be used as a cross-subsidy for electricity operators? If not, it should explain why not, because of the risk of destroying the level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, will it withdraw its own amendments, passed in committee, which insist on negotiated access? If those amendments are retained the package will be severely undermined. I look forward to working with you in the vote tomorrow. This has been an excellent cross-party endeavour and on behalf of the ELDR Group I wholeheartedly support the result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Liberalisation of gas and electricity is certainly part of the Lisbon Process, but this does not mean a free-for-all in the electricity and gas markets. Our concern must be for those we represent: customers both commercial and – the majority of us – domestic. We want the lowest prices possible for them in line with choice, and for choice you need information, including labelling about the source of electricity. You need reliability and no discrimination; you need help, particularly at domestic level, for energy efficiency measures; and you need strong emphasis on public service obligations. And I would like to emphasise that research and development should be a public service obligation, because in a free market research is one of the areas that is most at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We have amendments on subjects such as renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and combined heat and power. This is relevant. We must have joined-up thinking, and there must be references in this directive to those areas which may be covered by other directives but which must also be mentioned here. We want joined-up thinking, and we expect confirmation from the Commission that those measures, as important as these directives, will be part of the programme in the immediate future. We hope, therefore, for some limited success at Barcelona to take forward in a responsible way not a free-for-all, but a controlled competitive market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore the vote on these reports in Parliament seems to me to be extremely timely and I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, for the efforts he has made to make this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out our intended objectives with these reports. As Mr Linkohr has said quite rightly, this is something which may sound rather contradictory: a regulated deregulation, a regulated liberalisation, which is largely what makes up the European liberalisation model.</p>
<p class="contents">This objective is based on providing the European economy with all the elements of a market, while guaranteeing our citizens a series of rights which we consider to be basic within the model of society, the balances, solidarities and cohesion we want to create. It is therefore a question of offering freedom of choice to industrial and commercial clients on specific dates, namely 2003 and 2004, respectively, for electricity and for gas and, for domestic users, from 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers and producers must be able to access transport and distribution networks without discrimination and, to this end, the proposal provides for systems of transport and distribution which are separate – from a legal point of view – from the production and supply of gas and electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">Charges for access to the network which are set, published and approved by the competent national regulatory authority. Each of the States of the Union will create an independent regulatory authority with a common minimum level of competences.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation on the conditions for access to the network for the cross-border trade in electricity is intended to promote cross-border trade and overcome an unacceptable situation, as indicated by several speakers and the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, which is that there are 15 different electricity markets. Therefore, it is a question of achieving the true objective of this proposal which, as pointed out by Mr Rapkay, is simply a European electricity and gas market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another series of necessary measures created specifically in response to the requests of the Stockholm European Council. Amongst them, the first report on the creation of the internal market in gas and electricity which clearly indicated the distortions caused by the differing degrees of openness and the differences between the structural measures adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2001, the Commission also published a Communication on energy infrastructures which identifies the priority proposals and intends for the Member States to achieve an electrical interconnection equivalent to the minimum between now and 2005, that is to say, 10% of the capacity of installed production.</p>
<p class="contents">With the aim of guaranteeing greater protection of the environment, the Commission will present two additional directives during this year and, in this respect, I would say to Mrs McNally that, before the end of the year, I hope to present a directive on behalf of the Commission intended to promote cogeneration and at the same time prevent certain fraudulent uses which we all know about and which in the end lead to greater expense and wastage of electricity. As I have said, this directive will promote suitable cogeneration within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also wish to present a framework directive on the energy efficiency of equipment and apparatus installed in all buildings, which supplements the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that, together with the directive on the promotion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, the proposal on energy efficiency in buildings, the political commitment to guarantee the environmental aspects of our energy consumption, and the proposal on biofuels, we are making a real effort to combine the rules for the creation of the internal markets in energy and to improve their operation with the improvement in energy efficiency and the environmental aspects of energy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the directive and the Regulation we have presented, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Turmes and Mr Rapkay on their work as rapporteurs, which has been carried out rigorously and seriously, although we cannot accept certain specific aspects of certain amendments. However, in general we all agree with the spirit and objectives in terms of making these modifications to the current directives in force.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament – and specifically the two rapporteurs – is taking the approach contained in the Commission proposal, particularly with regard to the dates for opening up the market, the separation of the operators of the networks and the competences of the regulatory authorities, which are crucial elements in terms of the correct operation of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the Commission is in favour of the amendments that have been tabled, the majority of which are acceptable, either totally – with some changes to their wording – or partially. I am not only talking about the amendments which improve the situation of consumers and the amendments relating to a better definition of the public service aspects (always taking account of subsidiarity aspects, of course), but also the amendments which formalise cooperation between regulatory bodies and those relating to the competences of the regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, however, has certain reservations with regard to the amendments relating to non-discriminatory access to the network, which is essential to guaranteeing fair competition in the gas and electricity sectors. We therefore propose certain measures in this context: to legally separate the operators of the networks – an approach accepted by Parliament – and to establish access to the network on the basis of previously published charges, thereby replacing access on a negotiated basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr van Velzen who is going to withdraw the amendments relating to negotiated access, because I believe that is going to clarify the debate a lot and help us to reach a final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can the Commission accept the amendment dividing the proposal into two different texts for electricity and gas, bearing in mind the growing interdependence between the two markets and the fact that the majority of new electricity production will be based on production which uses gas as a fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the amendment relating to the funds for dismantling the nuclear sector is of the greatest importance. The Commission is aware of the importance of guaranteeing availability of the funds at all times for future dismantling activities, not only for the purposes of the internal energy market, but also to ensure that those funds are specifically destined for those activities. These funds have a specific and perfectly stipulated objective, which must be respected at all costs. Therefore, and with a view to dealing with this issue appropriately, the Commission is committed to presenting a proposal in the coming months, before the conclusion of the negotiation of this directive and this Regulation in Parliament. This issue is closely related to the system of guarantees and securities in the field of the use and handling of nuclear energy. We must be extremely rigorous in terms of the availability of these funds, within the corresponding framework, and we are studying the best legal formula for producing a proposal in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Regulation, I would like to congratulate Mr Mombaur on his wonderful work. The Commission can support the majority of the amendments proposed, some with slight modifications. This is the case, for example, with the amendments which propose the creation of a consultative group of national regulatory authorities, and those which propose the establishment of specific rules for the so-called national interconnectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Next I will mention the amendments which we find difficult to accept. Amendment No 19, for example, which proposes that the procedure of the Regulation Committee laid down in the Regulation should only be applicable for four years and that, after this period, Parliament and the Council should once again study the issue on the basis of the Commission proposal. I know that Parliament has considered this distinction clause in the context of the regulations on financial services and of the Lamfalussy report, but President Prodi, on 5 February, in his statement to this House, clearly said that that case could not set a precedent. Nevertheless, I can assure you that, in accordance with the agreement of the European Parliament and the Commission on the methods for applying comitology, the Commission will put all its efforts into ensuring the greatest possible transparency in it relations with Parliament in the context of the procedure laid down in the Regulation on access to the network for the cross-border trade in electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 16, 20, 22, 23, 24 and 25 seek to remove all the references in the Regulation to the regulatory authorities of the Member States, and suggest a more neutral expression such as ‘competent authority’. I do not believe these amendments to be appropriate since the Commission’s policy in this field is based on the principle that all States must designate one or several regulatory authorities, which are intended to play an essential role in the context of the implementation of the Regulation. Furthermore, accepting these amendments could be considered to be in contradiction with the creation of a consultative body made up of national regulatory authorities proposed in a series of amendments by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and supported by the Commission. However, the formula proposed by the Commission leaves an appropriate margin for subsidiarity so that each State can find the most suitable formula.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments relating to the treatment to be given to integrated generation in national charging systems are not acceptable either. This type of generation must be dealt with appropriately within the national charging systems, in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and reflecting costs which appear in the Regulation, and, with regard to the most important case in practice, the electricity produced from renewable energy sources, and with the directive on it. It is not therefore appropriate to exempt integrated generators from the payment of certain charges in a general way, rather than by case-by-case treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three amendments which propose that the text of the regulation should stipulate that the harmonisation of charges for access to national networks must be limited to the charges applicable to producers and that those charges must be reduced. However, this is an overly restrictive provision. National charges should be harmonised on the global basis of the charging structure, bearing in mind the specific characteristics of the national networks. We cannot therefore accept this amendment either.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe it appropriate to link the entry into force of the Regulation with that of the directive too strictly, as suggested in Amendment No 35. The promotion of cross-border trade is necessary in any event, regardless of the adoption of proposed amendments to the directive on electricity and gas currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, the vote on these texts is of the greatest importance. Thanks to the support for the main approaches and the broad convergence between Parliament and the Commission on all the measures, I hope that the negotiations in Barcelona will give us new impetus and that then, as Mr Adam indicated earlier, the negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission will give full and total support to this regulated liberalisation in the electricity and gas sector, key elements for the creation of the internal market and therefore for the competitiveness of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
