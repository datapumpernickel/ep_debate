<p class="contents">I see many colleagues concerned with the effect of the financial transaction tax on taxpayers and I absolutely agree. Everybody is concerned with that, but I would like to ask you to look at the balance; for example, what the taxpayers are paying for consolidating the financial system, directly through increasing the capital of the banks or indirectly through the European Stability Fund mechanism, the IMF or other mechanisms. Thousands of billions are going to consolidate the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">If the financial transaction tax is introduced, this burden on the taxpayers will be alleviated – not entirely but at least partially – and it is very important to note that, if part of it goes to the European budget, it does not mean that this is going to be an additional tax for the European budget. That would mean that the national contributions will be decreased, which, at the end of the day, would bring the entire revenue from the financial transaction tax to the national budgets. Think about that. This is going to be its real interest to the taxpayers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first step of European crisis management that will not be implemented merely at the level of international fiscal agreements, but will also have a practical impact.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that this new European tax cannot be implemented globally, and perhaps not even throughout the entire EU. Even so, however, it will provide the European economy with considerable revenues. Enhanced cooperation is a useful tool that can help ensure that financial transactions are conducted in a regulated and more traceable manner, thus eliminating the risk of the financial sectors once again becoming entirely detached from the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">A further merit of the report is that it very correctly goes on the assumption that the financial sector – which, through its speculative conduct that set its own short-term goals above all else, was one of the main agents of the crisis – did not assist in crisis management, and would have preferred to benefit from the crisis, if you will. The report addresses this contradiction, and excludes in a professional manner transactions that had not attracted a transaction tax, thereby improving transparency and reducing the risk of tax evasion and tax fraud. I therefore recommend that this report be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an instrument that makes it possible that even those who have hitherto refused to pay taxes, or who have paid very little in taxes, namely big business and the major banks, will have to pay taxes again. It is also an instrument that creates growth precisely where it is urgently needed: in the real economy, not in the financial sector. That is why I believe this House will do the right thing in the vote today.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to mention one aspect that I am very unhappy with, and that is what is going on in the Council. As far as I am concerned, what is currently going on in the Council is scandalous, where Mr Cameron and his friends – who are ever fewer in number – are managing to get their policies, designed to suit multi-millionaires and big business, adopted throughout Europe. Let us give Mr Cameron and his friends in the Council the right answer here today with a European Parliament vote in favour of a financial transaction tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this report, the European Parliament is supporting the proposals and the leading role that the Commission is taking in the implementation of this concept. Like the previous speaker, I would like to say that at present, the Council is blocking a Europe-wide introduction of the financial transaction tax; that at present, the Council is blocking the introduction of a financial transaction tax across the euro area; and that therefore, at the moment, the Council is making the introduction of a financial transaction tax unrealistic. If only nine Member States are in favour, then the transaction tax could become a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to end the blockade. We want to stick to our goal. For us, the financial transaction tax is a regulatory measure, and because it is a regulatory measure, I submitted an amendment for off-exchange financial transactions to be taxed at a higher rate than exchange transactions.</p>

A financial transaction tax is unavoidable. It is at the core of our exit strategy from the crisis. I emphasise that as the third Austrian in a row to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax. High-risk, poorly thought out financial speculation was one of the reasons why the huge financial, economic and now social crisis came about – if not its very cause. Banks are having to be rescued on a daily basis. The whole of Europe has been plunged into a deep crisis. Now, not sometime in the distant future, is the time to make the financial sector, which has lost touch with reality, shoulder its share of the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We pay taxes on everything imaginable: on labour, on energy. It is, in fact, absurd that the financial transaction tax has not yet been introduced. I expect the financial transaction tax to result in greater stability in the financial markets, a reduction in short-term speculation and, above all, greater focus on the real economy and the financing thereof. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, it is natural that the Commission, with the support of this House, wants to make it a European tax.</p>
<p class="contents">So the next logical step would be that this tax forms part of Europe’s domestic income, in order to give the budget a firmer footing, as is the case with any normal budget.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions, members here have emphasised that this tax should contribute to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, the introduction of the financial transaction tax as the Union’s own income – which, in order to be domestic income, should meet all the criteria laid down by the Lamassoure report and the Commission – would support the European budget; and the European budget is a growth budget. As a result, it would be a tool for growth and, at the same time, lighten the load of national budgets, since it would lead to a reduction in national contributions to the EU budget. Consequently, we have here a typical instrument that can simultaneously support the dual objective of fiscal consolidation and growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Each week, we hear in various quarters political leaders launching such a project as if it were their own personal invention and a revolutionary idea. The fact is that five years have passed since this Parliament first voted in favour of it. There have been other votes since then. One year has passed since the Commission submitted a specific, complete project – thank you, Commissioner Šemeta – and a group of experts from the 27 governments has been working on it for six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be under no illusions as to the nature of this tax. It is an indirect tax, like VAT. It does not therefore punish the financial operators. It will be paid by their customers. However, the tax base will be so broad and the tax rate so low that it will, in fact, be uncollectable. If it is well designed in terms of its practical details, it will not have significant transaction relocation effects either.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be under no illusions either as to its purpose, which is twofold: to finance common European objectives and to ease the burden on national budgets. While it is true that the unanimity of the EU27 will be difficult to obtain, if an agreement is found to establish an identical tax in a significant number of Member States, its natural appropriation should be to the EU budget. Those Member States that choose this appropriation should be able to reduce their national contribution to the Community budget accordingly. They will thus have the necessary flexibility to reduce their own deficit and their debt, and too bad for the rest! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the sector must pay part of the price for all this. Despite this, however, I do not believe that a tax introduced on financial transactions is the best way forward, primarily because the bulk of the tax costs will probably be passed on to the consumer and, moreover, I think it would be dangerous for Europe to believe that establishing regulatory standards in the European Union will encourage the rest of the world to follow our lead. In the current economic climate, we should be very proud of the fact that our financial services industry is so competitive. In light of this, I feel that we should pay attention to whether we should introduce policies or taxes that threaten this competitiveness. I confess that I do not have faith in the Commission’s impact assessments, as they are far from being consistent with one another. Initially, it was indicated that there would be a significant reduction in GDP, but then, once this came under fire, the Commission adjusted its assessments to depict the very opposite. This is why I will not be supporting the introduction of the financial transaction tax solely in Europe and I invite my colleagues in the European Parliament to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows quite clearly that the work put into the treatment of the Commission’s proposal for a transaction tax is important and is considered by Parliament to be of high priority. I am talking here about the work of both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, as well as all the work put in by Parliament’s various committees. This is a matter that goes back to the Council. As I said in my introduction, we hope it will be on the agenda at the June Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that I think is very pivotal in today’s debate, and that is the broad agreement there has been concerning the need for a sound, well-functioning financial sector. It is crucial for growth that enterprises have access to capital, and it is crucial that we have a financial sector that is not only dull enough to support sound products, but that is also sufficiently willing to take risks so that we can ensure that enterprises that create jobs can get the credit they need. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the work that the Council and Parliament have done jointly with the Commission as regards regulation of the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of an initial result, based naturally on the work of other presidencies, we have already completed a joint piece of work aimed at putting trading in derivatives in an entirely new light. I think it is very important that we realise what a milestone the proposal is. Secondly, there are the recent Council resolutions, for which trialogues have yet to take place in respect of achieving better and greater autonomy for the credit rating agencies, obtaining more information on the basis of credit ratings, and achieving a real and genuine debate concerning what credit assessments are based on. Most recently, I also hope that Parliament appreciates the proposal for project bonds – and I am sure that is the case, from what I have heard in the debate here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but certainly not least, I would like to mention the trialogue on capital requirements that will commence shortly. A huge amount of work has been done based on the Commission’s proposal, which heightens the requirements as regards the amount of capital, the quality of the capital, the liquidity available, management performed and the way it is ensured that financial enterprises are – if I can put it like this – in a good state before they start paying out bonuses and dividends.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that, in the light of the debate here today on enhanced cooperation, agreement by the 27 Member States and the functioning of the internal market, it is very important that the proposals I have just mentioned are adopted unanimously in the Council, even though a qualified majority might have been sufficient for these proposals. This is because it reflects the fact that in Council, too, there is a common agenda based on securing an improved, better regulated financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on a financial transaction tax thus supplements a substantial, heavyweight agenda dealing with regulation. A great many questions have been asked today, both by Members who support the proposed transaction tax and by Members who are against it: how will it work, who will actually pay the tax, should anybody be exempted from paying the tax, can we distinguish between speculative and non-speculative transactions, and if we do not succeed in getting unanimity in the Council, what advantages and disadvantages will enhanced cooperation have? As many Members have mentioned, achieving unanimity in the Council is a particularly long shot and, according to Members that support a transaction tax, implementing this within the context of enhanced cooperation will be problematic because of the internal market aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but naturally not least, there is debate concerning how great any revenues might be, and what they should be used for. We will continue to work on this in the Council. We have taken particularly thorough notes from the debate today and naturally, Parliament’s proposals and vote will form part of our future work. As I mentioned, we are taking a two-track approach. We will continue to investigate the Commission’s proposals, and the debate today will form a valuable part of that investigation, but we will also continue our work on discussing alternatives to a financial transaction tax. As I mentioned in my introduction, the countries tax the financial sector in various ways – whether through stamp duty, as has been mentioned several times today, or whether through activity-based taxes such as other countries have – for example, in the form of a payroll tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my thanks for a very diverse and very inspiring debate. Your work and input will provide the Council with a further basis for its continued work, and will also guide us on the road ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While death comes to all mortals, it seems that tax is evaded by some – especially financial institutions – while political leaders cannot agree how to tax them. There is an element here of Nero fiddling while Rome burns. The financial institutions are gaining, while politicians dither. The key element for the European Union is to bring pressure on the G20 to introduce this tax on a global scale, so that no country will gain at the expense of another. Failing that, the only other option is to introduce the tax on a Europe-wide, 27-State basis. We should look at that as a pilot project, maybe for two or three years, to see if the forecasts of flight of finance and transaction relocation really transpire. I have my doubts, because of the small amounts involved – 0.1% or 0.01%.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European-level transaction tax is not intended to apply to the population, but to high-value business transactions and speculative operations. It would ensure a more equitable distribution of the burdens of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, the Hungarian Government is planning to impose further austerity measures on the population under the pretext of the transaction tax. This transaction tax, however, has nothing in common with the one we are discussing here. This new tax, which will take effect next year, will be charged on retail transactions, including cash withdrawals and payments, bank transfers and bank card purchases. This is unacceptable! The EU transaction tax applies to the financial sector, to Member State and international oligarchs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to take courage and stop letting ourselves be ruled by fear of the financial system. The financial transaction tax is a political signal that has long been hoped for by the public, who are suffering from the crisis, in order to start down a path that will call a halt to the banks’ risk-taking behaviour. The financial sector was responsible for the crisis and we hope that this tax will help to limit speculation. This tax will help to increase the EU’s investment capacity and will create jobs.

The introduction of a financial transaction tax may be important when addressing the consequences of the crisis not only in the Member States but also for the general budget of the European Union. The method by which a tax thus collected will be distributed between the common budget will therefore be very important, as will the method by which the contributions made by the EU’s Member States will be reduced.

Seeking to improve this situation, governments throughout Europe have only been able to maintain balance through significant austerity measures.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major causes of the crisis, the financial sector, received sizeable state subsidies, yet we can see that it did not contribute sufficiently to sharing the costs of the crisis. In light of this, the introduction of the financial transaction tax has grown into one of the most important issues today. It has the ability to regulate the massively increased number of financial transactions, as well as speculative transactions, which have become greatly detached from the real economy. It could generate approximately EUR 57 billion in revenues, which could contribute significantly to the stabilisation of the markets and the equitable sharing of burdens.</p>

The European Union is the largest financial market in the world today, and for this reason it is our responsibility, too, to take the first steps in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discussions in Council continue, and I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for keeping up the momentum in the technical analysis and the negotiations process.</p>
<p class="contents">At the informal Ecofin Council in March 2012, ministers agreed that work should continue on the Commission’s proposal. On this basis, options which could gather a higher level of support in the short term should be explored. I welcome the Presidency’s intention to have an orientation debate at the 22 June Ecofin.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I will continue to defend the broad-based FTT at EU level. This is what we need for fair taxation, a level playing field in the single market and to meet global challenges such as climate change and development.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard a lot of arguments in favour of an FTT at EU level, and it is right. We also heard some concerns on specific points. The further technical work by Member States’ experts will bring clarity and solutions and, of course, the Commission will contribute to this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise one general point. The FTT will help to rebuild the relationship between the financial sector and the ordinary citizen, which has been greatly damaged in recent years. In helping to restore consumer confidence, and pointing the financial sector more towards the real economy, the FTT can become an important contributor to our growth agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These jurisdictions are still major financial centres despite these taxes. That clearly means that a carefully designed FTT does not lead to relocation of financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, some colleagues expressed fears about the negative effects of a financial transaction tax on growth, enterprises and households. The truth is that enterprises and households are suffering right now as a result of the financial crisis, caused by the financial sector because of high VAT levels and high taxes on labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding exemptions, I fully agree with Commissioner Šemeta that exemptions create distortions and room for loopholes. I would like to remind you that in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we reached a compromise provisionally exempting pension funds until the review of this directive. We did this in the spirit of compromise – a compromise which I regret is not yet in place – despite the fact that the FTT would have minimal impact on conservative funds. This compromise can better secure the pensions of Europeans by incentivising them to follow prudent investment strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">But if we were to suggest further exemptions on investment projects with risky investment policies, that would not be in line with what we want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to urge you to endorse by a large majority the report for a common system on an EU financial transaction tax. This would send a strong political message to the Council – especially today since there is the informal summit of the European Council on growth – and confirm that this House has been, and remains, consistent with the major policies and approaches that it has defended from the very beginning of this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To avoid the excesses of the banks in 2008 from being repeated in the future, we need to rigorously pursue two goals. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, it must not be possible for banks to operate in such a short-sighted and reckless manner in the future. Secondly, we must invest more in the real economy in order to stem the power of the financial sector in today’s economy. Both of these things can be achieved by the planned tax. Even the extremely low tax rates of 0.01% and 0.1% would provide the Member States with additional resources of up to EUR 100 billion. That EUR 100 billion could relieve the burden on severely stretched budgets and be used to invest in lasting growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that you will all use your votes to give this proposal the necessary emphasis, and I call on all the Member States not to block the Commission’s proposal in the Council.

According to Commission forecasts, this revenue could amount to EUR 57 billion. There is much to recommend the tax itself. As an instrument for dispensing a certain amount of tax justice and for combating financial speculation, it is necessary, albeit insufficient on its own; other measures, such as an end to tax havens and the more speculative financial products, are also needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we agree with the general form of the agreement, this proposal has provoked some reservations and disagreement, for instance, in relation to the more favourable treatment given to derivatives and other structured products, where evidence shows that speculation is most intense.

We completely oppose the Commission’s proposal to channel any revenue into the EU budget, with a corresponding cut in direct contributions from the Member States.

This would allow for a gradual reduction of the burden on national budgets. It is worth emphasising the fact that a financial transaction tax meets most of the criteria laid down by Parliament for a source of own resources, among others, sufficient revenues, stability, visibility and simplicity, low operating costs and efficient allocation of resources. I therefore believe that amounts generated through this tax should be treated wholly or at least to a significant extent as own resources. This would require the introduction of this tax in all Member States and effective coordination mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Citizens of all countries have had to foot the bill in order to save the financial sector and overcome the repercussions of the crisis. In the EU, we are combating this crisis, the result of which has been an increase in direct and indirect taxation and a significant reduction in salaries and pensions. At the same time, the financial sector is the only sector still largely exempt from taxation on its activities and transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot continue to function in such a way whereby someone benefits in both good times and bad, and the people will always have to bear the costs.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want to implement is actually an indirect tax, so that nobody is punished and our citizens will not be affected. Saying that, the tax is so low that the concerns raised here are not justified. Nine countries in Europe have already introduced some kind of financial transaction tax and the result has not led to financial leakage.</p>
<p class="contents">High-frequency trading has no productive effect and seriously disrupts market prices and the functioning of our economies. The role of the financial sector is to support the real economy, sustainable growth, employment and productive investment, not speculation and risk. In higher income countries, the FTT project may lead to higher growth in their economies and establish the basis for a mechanism for the elimination of further crises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that the financial sector had an important part to play in causing the economic crisis; however, the costs of the rescue programmes have been borne by central budgets, or, in other words, European taxpayers. There is a broad consensus in Europe and in the international arena that the financial sector should participate to a greater extent in the cost of rescue programmes. Fiscal intervention is also justified by the relatively low taxation of the financial sector compared to other sectors of the economy. The Commission’s proposal for a directive on a common financial transaction tax gives concrete form to these considerations. The European Union is thus the first in the G20 group to put forward a constructive regulatory proposal in this area. I think that the proposals tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are useful. As well as the rule of location, it is worth noting the introduction of an additional criterion of issuance in defining a transaction subject to taxation, the exemption from taxation of pension funds, and the establishment of preferential rates for trade in regulated markets. However, I think the amendment submitted during the plenary session regarding the exclusion of investment funds from taxation is detrimental. In my opinion, this proposal distorts the idea of a financial transaction tax, since it excludes a large group of financial institutions from taxation and thus reduces the effectiveness of the regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was precisely this risky business, detached from the real economy, which led us into the depths of the economic and financial crisis. The financial transaction tax should now put a brake on such short-term speculation, which has no added value of any kind for the real economy. Quite rightly, a broad majority of EU citizens are speaking out in favour of a financial transaction tax. In order to be efficient, the tax should be applied as widely as possible. This applies both to the nature of the transaction – currency speculators must also be included – and to the number of Member States. I hope that a broad majority will vote in favour, and that Parliament will hold its own against the various financial lobbies and financial markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The approved resolution at last provides a concrete and fair response to the financial sector, which has so far not been affected by any regulation in spite of the fact that it is directly responsible for the crisis. The tax rates of 0.1% for shares and bonds and 0.01% for derivatives, of which the majority of European citizens are in favour, provide Europe with an effective instrument of control and a tool in tackling tax evasion. The tax will be applied on the basis of the residence and issuance principles to financial institutions and non-European securities. I am critical of the exemption of pension funds, because they truly are tigers of the financial markets, which, since they carry out speculative, high-risk transactions, should be subject to the same control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
