<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, like previous speakers I, too, am gravely concerned that since last December the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated to a new low. There has been an appalling loss of life, the conflict in the region between the Israeli and the Palestinian people has deepened and the hopes of restarting the peace process regrettably have receded. Between 15 January and 25 January last, over 45 people were injured from bomb attacks alone, while ten people were killed during the same period. This is a staggering level of violence and hatred by any standards. Hundreds of Palestinians have been left homeless as a result of the demolition of nearly 100 houses by the Israeli forces at the refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. I very much welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency has written to the Israeli Foreign Minister expressing our deepest concern at the damage that has been done to projects funded by the European Union as a direct result of Israeli attacks against the Palestinian institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, violence has brought neither greater freedom to the Palestinian people, nor greater security for the Israeli people. In both cases the result of violence over the last few months has achieved the opposite to what was originally intended. Violence has only resulted in an intensification of hatred and recriminations between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples. The Israelis and Palestinians must resume the search for peace and the two sides must act together and they must act in tandem. The Mitchell principles have clearly laid down the broad parameters for an overall peace agreement. Any future agreement must both recognise Israel's right to live in peace and security and ensure that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are protected and promoted. This means the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Israeli and Palestinian authorities are going to have to move to renew some level of security cooperation with the aim of ending this awful present cycle of violence. Persons involved in perpetrating any of these awful terrorist attacks which have taken place must be arrested and must be brought to justice, including terrorists operating in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent discussions between representatives of the Palestinian authority and Prime Minister Sharon must be seen as a somewhat positive move, but negotiations must surely be meaningful and cannot be seen as a cosmetic exercise under any circumstances. We must all remember that Yasser Arafat is the democratically elected leader of the Palestinian people and he has the political authority and the political mandate to represent the concerns and the needs of the Palestinian people at this time. Yasser Arafat is a viable peace partner for Israel and he commands the support not only of his people, but of the broader international community. I welcome the recent article written by him in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> in which he stated that the Palestinians were ready to end the conflict with Israel. This call for reconciliation and coexistence must be welcomed by all interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly believe that the EU must continue to play as active a role as possible in brokering a peace between both sides. President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon are meeting this week and I hope that this will signal a more willing involvement on the part of the United States to re-intensify its efforts to reach a political agreement in the region. I strongly believe that the European Union and the American government have mutually important roles to play in ending the violence in the region and restarting meaningful peace talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Israelis and the Palestinians must also calm the situation and de-escalate the conflict. Sustained attacks by Israel on the Palestinian Authority and its security forces and facilities are wholly misguided. Incursions by the Israeli military forces into Palestinian territories must be halted immediately and there must also be a lifting of restrictions that are imposed on the Palestinian people. Let us all remember, as was said by previous speakers, that the alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Thank you, Mr President, there is, once again, a glimmer of hope in the Middle East. There are two indications of this. First of all, there was the discussion between Prime Minister Sharon and prominent representatives of the Palestinian Authority that was held in the middle of last week. Furthermore, a regular follow-up every couple of weeks has been announced. In addition, there is the public assurance by Mr Arafat in the American press that he wants to call an end to the terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens. I sincerely hope that the meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon next Thursday will help these developments move towards a de-escalation of the extremely bloody Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Just consider the extent of the killings and destruction on both sides. And suffering, certainly personal suffering, cannot be captured in cold statistics or weighed up on a merely rational level.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, a consistent rejection of, and fight against, terrorism do remain the conditions <span class="italic">par excellence</span> for creating any political compromise between the State of Israel and its neighbours. This is of direct interest to various countries in the region, for they fan the Palestinian and Lebanese flames of terrorism willingly and knowingly. This is why the clear warning by President Bush addressed to them in last Wednesday’s State of the Union speech deserves full support from the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this political realism is lacking on our Continent, precisely at a time when European shortcomings have come to light in NATO in such a poignant way. The EU Member States support efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, especially by making a credible and effective contribution to the current fight against terrorist networks in that region. This will benefit the Israelis and Palestinians alike. I would therefore call on the Member States in the person of their High Representative, Mr Solana, to make this contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, a young person from my town, Apeldoorn, sent a touching e-mail about peace in the Middle East. His appeal was not for a spiral of violence but a spiral of prayer. Along with the psalmist, I would say indeed: pray for the peace of Jerusalem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, to speak of the senseless destruction – and this is a point on which we obviously agree with him – of the Palestinian infrastructure and to speak of the selective killings of Palestinians without mentioning the Israeli victims is absolutely intolerable. But this is also symptomatic of the policy that Commissioner Patten has, for many months, been conducting towards Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the High Representative, Mr Solana, is here with us, because at least he can raise the quality of our debate slightly above the level we are used to in this House. Having said that, I do not think, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that we can resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine by simply asking both sides to make a little effort, or even asking both to make a great effort. Mr Barak made some proposals with which we are all familiar and these proposals were not accepted. The Palestinian Authority existed and the Palestinian Authority has sanctioned the suicide attacks that were and still are carried out every day against Israel. That is the reality today.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Union has an opportunity to show true generosity, but not by means of the tourist trips that Mr Wurtz is suggesting. The European Union could show its true generosity by saying to the public, to the people of Europe, that they must have the courage to fully integrate Israel into the European Union, that this is the only way to guarantee security in Israel, to finally give five million Israelis the feeling that they can live in peace alongside the Palestinians, but within the European Union. This proposal has been put forward. Ladies and gentlemen, we must urgently begin to reflect on this in slightly more depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only thing that changes is the state of the crisis, which, unfortunately, is increasingly worse in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the last resolution we approved in the European Parliament, with the majority support of the parliamentary groups, there have evidently been more terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. I think there have been five in the last ten days.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also, however, seen the siege by the Israeli army increasingly close in on the Palestinian population and its institutions. There has been very considerable material and personal damage which I consider to be completely unjustifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the landscape of violence, which is very controversial both inside and outside the region and also here in the European Parliament, we should be able to agree on certain things. The first is that nothing can justify acts of terrorism, which reduce the chances of peace and produce nothing but pain and indignation. The second is that it seems clear that the Palestinian National Authority does not have the capacity to restrain this wave of violence. The third is that not everything is permissible in the fight against terrorism: when we have the Rule of Law, we must always act within the parameters of the law and with scrupulous respect for human rights. The fourth is that the parties in conflict must understand that no act of violence is going to improve their position. And the fifth is that we cannot stand on the sidelines; on the contrary, the European Union must maintain its political pressure and its permanent presence in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to see the efforts the Council and the Commission are making, but I am even happier to hear that there is a glimmer of light on the horizon. I agree with the Council declaration, which says that our first priority must be to put an end to the suffering of both peoples. And it seems to me completely pointless for us to try to find somebody to blame. On the contrary, I believe that we must seek solutions and, for example, the European Parliament should promote and sponsor an international conference for peace in the Middle East, a second instalment of the one held in Madrid ten years ago, from which Mr Solana could no doubt recount many experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that amongst all of us we can contribute to peace, because I believe that that is the only truly important thing at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appreciate the Presidency’s flexibility as regards time: if the President wants to make this a genuine political debating chamber once again, it may be no bad thing that he is showing some flexibility towards us. I would like to say that we are caught up in an appalling, absurd situation: when the Israelis elected Ariel Sharon to power they thought he would bring them more security, but they are now in a terrible situation. When President Bush was giving his assessment of the tragic situation after the attacks on the Twin Towers, he gave the impression of intending to eradicate the sources of hatred and to genuinely do something about this tragic affair. However, if the United States now backs Ariel Sharon, there is a danger that it will no longer be able to play the mediating role it had even under Bill Clinton. At present, it would appear that Yasser Arafat is not in control of the situation, for the terrorism of <span class="italic">Hamas</span> is still gathering momentum, but if Mr Arafat were to lose all support, the consequences for Palestine would not bear thinking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is up to us, to Europe to do something. I do not want to shock anybody, but I believe that the only way to give Israel security – as many Members have said – is to establish a Palestinian State. Therefore, we must start to declare right now that we are prepared to recognise such a State and also that we need to have a special relationship with both the Israeli State and the Palestinian State. I will not go so far as to mention accession to the Union, as Mr Dupuis did, for fear of causing offence, but if Europe wants to genuinely lay the history of the twentieth century to rest, it cannot confine itself to enlargement and refuse to assume full responsibility for the consequences of European history.</p>

This spiral of violence must now be broken as a matter of urgency. The international community must urge both parties to reach a permanent settlement and cease the terror. One glimmer of hope is at any rate the consultation between Prime Minister Sharon and some Palestinian official representatives that was held last weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Union is concerned, a tougher stance would be welcome. We must strengthen our position in the peace talks, given the exceptional interests – and first and foremost the humanitarian interests – that are at stake. European leaders can no longer afford to look on from the sidelines, at the risk of a much greater and more extensive conflict emerging in the Middle East. The peace process will be a lengthy and tiresome process, but I remain convinced that with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance, we can attain our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In actual fact, there seems to be greater awareness within Parliament of the tragedy taking place and also of where responsibility lies for this situation, not least our own responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Solana has said on a number of occasions: we have wasted many opportunities. I fear we will waste others too, but I do feel it is important that we have gained this awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">I find Mr Bush’s support of Ariel Sharon’s policy<span class="bold"> </span>truly irresponsible, opportunist and inhumane, for it is not that the two sides lack confidence in each other: this is a specific policy, a specific decision – Ariel Sharon has made this explicitly clear in his speeches in the Knesset – not to allow a Palestinian State to exist, apart from ‘Bantustan’ territories, and not to give back the Occupied Territories. I do not understand why we do not realise that this is his policy and take appropriate action. At the same time, some responsibility certainly lies with Yasser Arafat, and it is an appalling tragedy for both Palestinians and Israelis that terrorist acts are taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my hope lies in Commissioner Patten’s words, in Mr Solana’s words, in actions and signs, and I would like to tell you of the great hope that I have in Israeli society. On Saturday, together with 300 Israelis – young people, coloured people, young lads who have refused to serve in the Occupied Territories, women, university professors – we crossed the Kalandia checkpoint, running serious risks for the Israelis who crossed it were told they were not allowed to enter the Occupied Territories. Three hundred of us crossed the Kalandia checkpoint to go to meet Yasser Arafat. The young Israelis said: ‘We want peace. We are the other Israel’. And Mr Arafat embraced them. However, the most important part was in the afternoon when we met the Palestinians and Palestinian organisations, and they too displayed their desire for peace. I therefore feel that it is imperative that we believe in these organisations and act to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">I too, like Mr Cohn-Bendit, want to issue a challenge. If Mr Arafat leaves the territories, there is a danger that we will not be able to get him back in again. It is important that we work to support this operation, to bring Abu Ala and Avraham Burg here. International protection is vital for the Palestinian people; moreover – and here I agree with Mr Sakellariou – it is vital that we take practical action, even suspending the association agreement, for Israel must respect human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, each nation necessarily aspires to sovereignty, in other words, to have the full reign of a territory that is its own and which it can organise as it wishes. Secondly, it is not, therefore, borders which create conflicts, but the lack of safe and recognised borders. It is not the division of nations which engenders war, it is when the nations are thrown together. Throughout the world, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies have failed, causing bloodshed, and yet there are many utopians even in this House who would like to conduct such experiments on our European societies. I greatly admire Mr Cohn-Bendit’s realistic attitude towards the Middle East, an attitude that totally contradicts the hare-brained ideas of his friends and his own colleagues, regarding the situation in France for example.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, the tragic but fragmented events – bloody attacks, arms trafficking, the mutual accusations of murder, terrorism, the repeated failures at maintaining a truce, the unacceptable destruction – are sad consequences, which must not, however, be confused with the profound causes of the situation. The fundamental problem is that there will only be peace if the Israelis and the Palestinians each have a territory that is marked by recognised borders and, within this territory, they have the opportunity to govern their country freely, without threats or interference. The State of Israel now possesses three quarters of Palestine’s former territory under the British mandate. The Palestinians must be permitted to live freely, in peace, in the other quarter.</p>
<p class="contents">As sensitive as some places are for the Jewish people and for other believers, places which have great religious significance, we must bring an end to the colonisation of the occupied territories which stems from 1967. We must observe the United Nations Security Council resolutions and we must also bring an end to a military occupation that has lasted for almost 35 years now and which is an outright record in history. Of course, Israel has a right to secure serious guarantees in exchange for its withdrawal. These guarantees can be granted within the framework of the United Nations Organisation, and, in particular, by the United States of America. They must be more serious than those that failed to prevent the 1967 conflict. However, this is no longer 1967. Israel must thus have the courage to appreciate its victories, to withdraw from the occupied territories. Only then can peace return to the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think one has to distinguish between murdering civilians willy-nilly, pursuing possible terrorists or, on the other hand, setting a 7-day deadline and positively inviting the radicals to promptly wreck the possibilities for dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Israeli settlement policy, which is to be continued, provides us with examples of this sort of thing, as does the hopeless existence which drives Arab Palestinian refugees to turn themselves into weapons, and the consideration of the idea that they should return to their original homes and thereby put a question mark against the State of Israel's long-term viability. We also see it in the destruction of infrastructure on Palestinian territory, and that in areas that have nothing to do with counter-terrorism, but – as Commissioner Patten rightly said – destroy prospects for development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons that we have to make it clear that we, the European Union, have to make a fresh start, and it is perhaps not right that you, Mr Solana, are going there to play for high stakes in a week's time, followed by the American representative the week after. So we shuttle hither and thither and get nowhere. Why do you not, for once, go there together in the same week in order to make clear that this is a joint European and American initiative to hammer the point home that we will no longer allow things to go on the way they are. Both of you must go there together and take funds with you in order simultaneously to give hope and guarantees of security.</p>
<p class="contents">We must find a new point of departure, and we will not do it in the ways we have used so far, nor – and this remark I address to Mr Sakellariou and others – by adopting resolutions apportioning guilt in a one-sided way, because then we are destroying the opportunity to be intermediaries.</p>

<p class="contents">I am very glad that, after a short, perhaps terrifying moment, the European Union has clearly demonstrated that it is not willing to sit back and let the Palestinian structures, supported moreover by funds raised by the European Union, be destroyed. This is not about denying Israel the right to defend itself against terrorism, but about our strongest condemnation and rejection of excessive courses of action that really have nothing to do with counter-terrorism. I am very pleased that this is what both representatives have done, clearly and unmistakably, and that they have made their position clear without falling prey to emotionalism.</p>
<p class="contents">That is important because the pro-peace groupings that are present both in Israel and in Palestine are waiting for Europe's voice to be heard. I support all the efforts at joint action with the USA, but where this is not possible, we must be an identifiable, and indeed, readily recognisable, European voice.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation, on the Balkans, may well be taken as underlining all of what has been said here. I would only ask that particular additional attention be given to the situation in Albania, where things are not at present developing very well. I wish to make it very clear that I cannot see us going down the road towards an association agreement with Albania if Albania does not concern itself with the country's stabilisation. What has happened in the past weeks is, alas, no contribution to stability. We want stability in the Balkans, we have done much, and with great effort, to achieve it, and let no power in the Balkans cause this stability to collapse again. I would therefore ask you both to follow events in Albania, in particular, very closely, and represent our positions there with a great deal of clarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After months of heartrending and meaningless violence in the Middle East, we must now nurse and foster each and every glimmer of hope. President Arafat has indicated that he is prepared to negotiate with any Israeli party and to help search for a creative solution for the return of the refugees. These are two courageous steps forward which deserve our support and should be immediately responded to by an equally generous offer by Prime Minister Sharon. In addition, we have noticed that, in Israel, a shift has emerged in public opinion with regard to one of the key issues of the conflict, namely the illegal occupation of the Palestinian regions. There are now 110 reservists of the Israeli army who have signed a petition in which they refuse to take part in the occupation any longer. These brave soldiers deserve the open and emphatic support of the European Union because they are choosing international law and human rights, rather than choosing to obey their orders and to follow the path of least resistance. They are, in fact, choosing the road of peace, away from occupation, away from terror and state terror, and towards the negotiating table and, hopefully, peace eventually. I would be interested to hear from Messrs Solana and Patten whether they are prepared to express this support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should simply like to recall the closing statement of the special session of the Mediterranean Forum, held in Brussels in November, before the vote on 13 December on our recommendations preceding the formal declaration by the Laeken Council. I would remind you that this statement called for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the Tenet plan and of the recommendations of the Mitchell committee, and reiterated our conviction, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that establishing an impartial monitoring mechanism would serve the interests of both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that all of this has come to nothing and that, in fact, recent events seem to have closed the door on any serious attempt to restart negotiations. Although, like William of Orange, I believe that it is neither necessary to have hope in order to embark on a course of action nor is it necessary to succeed in order to persevere, I feel that we must welcome the fact, Mr Solana, that you are ceaseless, as you have just demonstrated, in making every possible effort to give renewed hope, which is so badly needed in that part of the world, to the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only encourage you to pursue all initiatives for cooperation between the United Nations, the United States and the most directly involved Arab States, in order to put forward proposals, in conjunction with them, on actions that are crucial to restoring mutual trust and respect, without which the current downward spiral of violence can never be halted.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am not in favour of our Parliament today playing the role of excommunicator. As Commissioner Patten said in his last speech to this House, ‘What is past, is past’. What we are interested in is the future and the immediate future. I also feel that I am summing up the opinion of the majority of Members when I repeat that we in Parliament are ready and willing to fulfil our mandate to take the initiative by issuing another invitation – why not President Cox? – to the representatives of the two States at the highest level, perhaps even Mr Arafat himself, to come and explain their intentions to us, as the speakers of the Palestinian Legislative Council and the Knesset did in September 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, we would like to encourage you to give positive consideration, in conjunction with the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, to the possibility of holding an ambitious peace conference along the lines of the conference held in Madrid, in which, Mr Solana, you played such an important part, as you reminded us. In our own interests and for the sake of coherence with the spirit of our unreserved commitment to the fight against terrorism, we must play as active a role as possible in saving the peace process, while respecting the legitimate rights of the region’s peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has now become quite clear that Mr Sharon’s policy is leading nowhere. When there are no political prospects on the horizon, the Old Testament prescription of ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’ leads directly to horror and to chaos. Bloodshed leads to further bloodshed. This is a return to the Middle Ages, even to prehistoric times.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore high time that the Council of the European Union, the Commission and all our governments spoke up, loudly and clearly, whatever the President of the United States might think. It is Mr Sharon, and not Mr Arafat, who has the power to end the conflict. How can he do this? Simply by complying with international law, by ending the repressive occupation of Palestine and by withdrawing behind Israel’s internationally recognised borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way to protect both Israeli and Palestinian citizens is to re-establish a proper border between the two peoples. The way out of the deadlock of hatred does not lie in the humiliation and the destabilisation of Mr Arafat. It lies in land distribution and in acknowledging Palestinian nationhood, not in the medium term, but immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, Mr Patten, you must state this quite clearly. This is the urgent message that all of Europe’s representatives should be conveying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Has the time come now for us to move on from dialogue and move into shared partnerships, overcoming perceived religious differences to tackle common human evils of poverty, ill health and illiteracy? Surely the place today for dialogue is within Islam, between Muslim and Muslim, to work out ways of discarding false jihads, rejecting distorted interpretations of the Koran that lead inevitably to misguided martyrdoms and terrorist assaults. Islam is a faith that promotes peace, equality and a secure life.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile we should tackle the lack of democracy in the oil-rich states. Here we can assist through building civil society and use means such as our association agreement with Egypt to exert undoubted influence.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative Solana mentioned the Islamic Republic of Iran. My view is his as well. I believe we should open a Commission office in Tehran as soon as possible. This is an Islamic state, and yet a democracy; it has Sharia law, and yet a parliament. Surely Iran is part of the solution rather than part of the problem – a peaceful society in a violent region.

But I suppose we should not be surprised: Mr Sharon's own terrorist behaviour in Lebanon, when he permitted the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, was subsequently condemned by Israel's Kahane Commission of Inquiry. Given this fact, it is regrettable that he was subsequently elected as Prime Minster of Israel, this being the root of many of the current problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Current Israeli policy is ludicrous and counterproductive. How can they make demands on Arafat to behave as if he was the leader of a normal state, while at one and the same time they make him a virtual prisoner in his own home, destroy his airport and his broadcasting station and humiliate him? Who do they want to replace him with? In the post-11 September situation, the European Union has been oversensitive in its approach to the Middle East. We are indeed an honest broker and we should be vigorous in that approach. The fact that the Americans are indebted to us for the solidarity and the support that we provided when they needed it should mean that we are entitled to a reciprocal response from them. And instead of being the puppet of Israel, they should join with us in an even-handed policy approach to the tragedy in the Middle East. If that is not forthcoming, then we should act on our own. It is frustrating that the United States through its present stance is becoming much more part of the problem than part of the solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are clearly facing a frustrating, cruel and, if I may say so, surreal, situation. It is surreal because we are facing a situation in which the Prime Minister of Israel does not support the constructive conclusions of his Foreign Affairs Minister. It is also surreal because Mr Sharon – who regrets not having destroyed Mr Arafat, who he describes as irrelevant, in Beirut in 1982, and who calls the Palestinian Authority a terrorist organisation – is meeting with three notable members of this so-called terrorist organisation. It is surreal because Mr Arafat is under great pressure to combat terrorism but, at the same time, Israel – and we are allowing it – is bombing and thereby destroying the resources available to the Palestinian Authority for combating that terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">This surrealism, however, is welcome if it can bring us closer to peace and development in the region, not only for Palestine. I would like to say however – and I hope I am wrong – that I hope these talks by Mr Sharon with these supposed terrorists from a supposed terrorist organisation, are not simply another attempt to gain time before his meeting with President Bush in Washington tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, a question relating to the famous seized vessel, the <span class="italic">Karim-A</span>: it appears that the people who are trying to ascertain whether the evidence of Iran’s involvement is reliable are working on the basis of stronger evidence than the appearance of arms which are ‘made in Iran’, because we all know that the fact that arms are manufactured in a particular country does not necessarily mean that they are supplied by the government of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I say this – and I will end here – because, in this era of trilateral evil, and the demonisation of the situation and the desire to spread suspicions all over the place, it could be a fatal error to encourage suspicions of this type in relation to those invisible enemies which Mr Bush is currently dealing with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not sure that the largely one-sided tone of this Chamber is at all helpful. I endorse Mr Brok's call for a more balanced approach but as requested I also want to take the opportunity briefly to touch on another area of crisis which is of increasing concern at the moment and where the European Union has the capacity to exert some influence.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to Zimbabwe. Even if electoral observers are allowed in, we must maintain the pressure on Mr Mugabe to deliver free and fair elections. We do not want to be in a position of merely recording that the election was fixed and standing back and wringing our hands afterwards. We want the presence of observers to deter violence and electoral fraud so that the Zimbabwean people can make a genuinely free choice. Many of us continue to be alarmed by reports from inside Zimbabwe about the situation on the ground. I am referring to the fact that five MDC supporters have been killed in the past week, that MDC demonstrations and rallies have been disrupted by the police, that the independent press is restricted, the <span class="italic">Independent</span> correspondent, Basildon Peta, was earlier today arrested under the Public Order and Security Act and the Australian journalist Sally Sara has been refused admission. Taken together one might think that these matters already constitute a breach of EU conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some questions for Mr Solana. What representations are being made to the Government of South Africa to apply greater regional pressure on the Mugabe government? Are the measures for the implementation of smart sanctions now in place? What level of deterioration in the situation will trigger these sanctions? Is the European Union's response being fully coordinated with that of the United States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are further from this goal than ever before, or so it seems. Nobody feels safe anymore, either in Israel or in the Palestinian state. Nobody appears to be able to play an objective role in getting the peace process back on track. The extremists set the agenda, and the Americans seem to tolerate the tough stance adopted by Prime Minister Sharon. Whichever way one defines the position of President Arafat, it seems to me that, without him, chaos would descend on the Palestinian Regions.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the European Union do? In my view, we should mainly keep the channels of communication open. I back those fellow MEPs who say that we must continue talks with both parties and exert pressure on Israel to accept the Palestinian Authority as the only significant interlocutor, and so find the way back to consultation. However, we must also continue to ask Mr Arafat to tackle the terrorists on his own home turf.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should be prepared to postpone a certain form of cooperation with Israel in this context, but not to rule such postponement out in respect of the Palestinian Authority either, should it transpire that the fight against terrorism is not being taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to yet another point which I should like to put to Mr Solana. The conflict in the Middle East is also tied in with the relationship between the EU and the United States, and this issue is also important in the fight against terrorism. In addition, I should like to find out his reaction to the statements by President Bush who talks about the axis of evil and the three countries he refers to by this. What is the EU’s reaction to this? Is he driving a new wedge between the European Union and the United States? I would particularly like to know what implications these statements by President Bush have for the policy of the European Union, particularly with regard to Iran. I am interested to know how the Council assesses Iran, but also the other countries which are being accused by the Americans of state support for terrorism. In my opinion, this will be an important issue in the time to come, also in connection with the fresh debate on the military superiority of the United States and the military weakness of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are we really in the worst stage of the Palestinian crisis or has the tragedy risen to its climax, to be followed by catharsis and a way out?</p>
<p class="contents">Without wishing to judge, we must admit that Sharon's policy has even made victims of the Israelis: he has painted himself into a corner with a no-win policy. Perhaps Sharon dreams of a final solution to the Palestine problem, to complete the circle of one of the darkest periods in the history of Europe. But America must take its share of the blame for failing to understand that supporting no-win policies basically undermines its own policy and role.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we Europeans merely bystanders here? No, we are not. I believe that the proposals made by both Commissioner Pattern and the High Representative, Mr Solana, and everything else said during the debate, are very serious proposals with the potential to become practical policy. Nor do I think that we, the European Union, are mere bystanders doomed, like Sisyphus, to roll the boulder to the top of the mountain and then watch others toss it back over the edge.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, also turn our attention to other matters because now we have a crisis in the Middle East and tension on the borders of the European Union. And then we have another crisis within Europe. The Balkan crisis. In this sense, Mr Solana was right to comment on the state of flux around Albania, around Kosovo, around Montenegro and the area in general, where there is not so much a fragile equilibrium as an unstable equilibrium, which is far worse. The success of any endeavour which, in the Balkans in particular, has been undertaken mainly by the European Union, must be based on – and we must insist on – a fundamentally political solution, because that is where, in the final analysis, we shall be judged on our ability to manage crises peaceably and bring about political results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would stress once again that the difficulty of the problem is not the absence of a mechanism to provide a solution to the crisis. We already have the Mitchell report, which contains the steps to be followed, and it has been accepted by both sides. The problem is not that we do not have rails on which the train should be travelling but that we have not been able to get the train out of the station. The train cannot leave the station until the requirement of a seven-day period of complete calm has been fulfilled. But what happens? When you set seven days of complete calm as a precondition, you can always find somebody who is not for the peace process and who, at the last minute, can engineer a catastrophe. Therefore, you are back to square one. That has happened on a couple of occasions. This manner of doing things hands the initiative to the most radical people and takes it away from the moderates. That is the problem we have at this point in time.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the modest beginnings of conversations – I would not call them negotiations between the two sides – held right now, yesterday, tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, maybe at the beginning of the week, will produce at least a change in the way they handle the crisis, by not placing the solution in the hands of those who do not want the process to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not received many questions. Therefore I am not going to respond to the very interesting remarks you have made. At least 90% of your statements have been supportive.</p>
<p class="contents">Two questions have been put very clearly and I would like to answer them before I make my final remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question by Mr Menéndez del Valle regarding <span class="italic">Karine-A</span>, I do not have the intelligence on which several countries have based their statements. Several countries – some are members of the European Union – state that their intelligence has established a link. Whether it is a state-to-state or state-group-to-state-group link is an open question. But there is no doubt that some kind of link exists between the Iranian people and some Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question I would like to answer is from Mr Brok, although he is not here. This joint effort is being carried out every day on the ground by representatives of the European Union, of the United States, of the Secretary-General of the UN and of the Russian Federation. They work together every day. I would remind you also that we – that is, I, Mr Powell, Mr Ivanov, Mr Koffi Annan – meet regularly to deal with this issue collectively.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be tenacious and persevering. We also need a change in both societies, and not only in the authorities that lead the countries. Those societies have indeed changed very profoundly in the last few years. Israel has changed. The strong, broad-based peace camp there has not disappeared, but it has been reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing has happened on the other side. Frustration has created a sentiment that the peace camp cannot bring about peace in a reasonable period of time. That lack of trust and of confidence between both sides was not present before. I remember very well the relative friendship in Oslo between Arafat and Peres and between Rabin and Arafat. That has disappeared. We have to do something to reconstruct society vis-à-vis society and we, as Europeans, have a tremendous amount of work to do there, to bring these societies together, because they will have to live together. Whatever we can do through this Parliament, through the institutions, through the NGOs, we must do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you two little anecdotes, one from a very good friend of mine who was in the peace camp in Jerusalem. The other day he told me that he would not dare send his daughter and his son to school in the same bus. That is a dramatic and profound change in the heart and in the mind of somebody who would otherwise be a fighter for peace. On the other side, on the Palestinian side, you go to a hospital, you talk to a paediatrician and he tells you how a little boy has been killed. This is a terrible blow to trust and confidence among people. Therefore we have to work also with societies. We have to engage societies, universities, schools, doctors, etc. to impress upon them that they have to live together and that Europe will be behind that sentiment of reconciliation. That is something we have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by recalling a beautiful phrase from Yitzhak Rabin who, without any doubt, was the architect of the Oslo process, together with Shimon Peres. He used to say something that is still valid. We have to fight against terrorism, as if there were no negotiations, and we have to negotiate as if there were no terrorism. That is the approach we have to rally around today. It is necessary to continue the negotiations, to continue talking, to continue moving the political scene – the centre of gravity has to be politics. Until they put politics at the centre of gravity, it will be very difficult to move the process forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be proud of what we as Europeans are doing. We do not have the capacity to solve the problem, but we can move in the right direction as soon as possible and aim for peace. This is not a question only of values. It is part of our history, no doubt about that, but it is also part of our future, the future of this European Union, of the countries in an enlarged European Union and of the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, which are part of our family.</p>
