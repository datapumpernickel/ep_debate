<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="bold"> </span>– <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, my task today is to report on the deliberations on the Green Paper on entrepreneurship in Europe. There are actually three documents: the Green Paper itself, the Commission communication entitled ‘Thinking small in an enlarging Europe’ and the Commission report on the implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises. This House has confined itself to discussing the Green Paper, and I would like to begin by paying tribute to the Commission for presenting – with these three documents – an overview, appraisal and evaluation of the current debate about entrepreneurship and the promotion of business start-ups in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also, however, like to thank my fellow Members who ensured, during the deliberations, that the lead committee has presented to this House a comprehensive list of fifty points which gives the Commission a number of tasks to address, while also making it clear that we fully support the Commission’s basic line on this issue. The committee endorsed the draft report with the proposed amendments by a substantial majority of forty-one votes in favour and just four against, which shows that there is a broad consensus in Parliament on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Liikanen, what we want to do, on the basis of your Green Paper, is to support and undertake everything that helps to increase the number of self-employed persons in the European Union, encourages small businesses, and thus establishes conditions conducive to growth and innovation, especially in the services sector. This Green Paper rightly defines entrepreneurship and discusses why it is important for jobs and growth, for competitiveness, for the realisation of individual potential and for society as a whole. On this basis, we agree that we must improve the framework conditions. That includes measures in the field of research and development, and it also includes measures to alter the different attitudes towards starting a business and people’s willingness to assume risk. It is striking, Commissioner, that your Green Paper – and, indeed, every other assessment – makes it clear that the willingness to assume entrepreneurial risk and start a business is high in some European Union countries, although not as high as in some non-European states – with the exception of Ireland – but that in the majority of European states, it is well below the global average. It is also striking that your index naturally takes account of agriculture, while the international index used includes other criteria as well. It is also apparent that the European Union States with the highest level of public expenditure as a proportion of GDP, the most serious problems with unemployment and the greatest difficulties complying with the Stability and Growth Pact are also trailing well behind on business start-ups. So there must be a correlation between generous provision by the State, the social system, attitudes towards claiming state benefits, and the willingness to become self-employed. This is the starting point for our proposals, which I do not want to discuss in detail. You have all read them; there are fifty of them in total. We have achieved a broad consensus between the groups in this House, and Commissioner, we do not want this European Parliament report and the Green Paper to suffer the same fate as the Green Paper on trade, which was debated and then quietly disappeared before the appropriate action could be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all my fellow Members in particular as well as the Commission for the document, which was of extraordinarily high quality, which is not always the case. Nonetheless, Commissioner, you should not be tempted to extend this praise to industrial policy just yet, for in my capacity as my group’s rapporteur, I would like to conclude by commenting on the report by Mrs Zrihen. It is a very good report on industrial policy, but we do not agree on all points. There are widely divergent views, also within my group, on one key issue in particular, namely the future role of open coordination, and whether everything can be coordinated or whether in many areas it should be the Member States which take responsibility and fundamentally improve the framework conditions for business start-ups and industrial policy decisions. On that note, I would like to thank you for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents">A few years ago in Lisbon, the European Union set itself the objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. I am convinced that this objective concerns industry most of all, manufacturing industry in particular, because the industrial base is the backbone, the economic engine for growth in the European Union. That is why the Commission’s communication, which gave rise to this report, is vitally important. It is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, however, we have had the impression that manufacturing industry had rather been forgotten, with all attention being given to the service sector or new information and communication technologies. Industrial policy as such had not been mentioned for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication at long last raises the question of what the European authorities can do to help our industry. According to the Commission, industrial policy can have only one objective: competitiveness. There is some logic in this. Indeed, in an increasingly open world economy European industry can only have a future if it is able to integrate successfully into the global economy. But we have to agree what competitiveness means. Let us remain true to the spirit of Lisbon and Gothenburg. The balanced three-pillar approach – economic, environmental and social – really must be our guide in our analysis of competitiveness. European competitiveness must be competitiveness in research, skills, manpower training, productivity, respect for the environment and, last but not least, the quality of industrial relations. Any quest for competitiveness by continuously cutting costs, especially labour costs and/or through environmental laxity, would be totally fanciful.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the means of achieving that objective, we know that industrial policy results from the interaction of policies in a number of fields: research, training, competition policy, the internal market, taxation, employment and social affairs, and many other fields besides. While the European Union has a considerable involvement in many of these fields, it is essential that we find the best way of coordinating all those different instruments in order to arrive at a genuine industrial strategy for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication asks the right questions but fails to offer enough definite answers. The communication opens a genuine debate, as we shall see this evening. The Council has already made its views known. Parliament will do so through this report. We must, of course, as Mr Langen said, make this a useful exercise by following it through with specific measures. That is why we are asking the Commission to embody the ideas expressed in this communication in an action plan, which will then be submitted to the Council and Parliament for adoption. The main points of the action plan will be as follows. Firstly, the aims of industrial policy must be incorporated into all the Community’s common policies, especially the policy on competition and the control of state aids. Secondly, the objectives must include the harmonisation of national taxation systems, which are adversely affecting the single market. Thirdly, the plan must also include major administrative simplification for setting up new businesses. Fourthly, research and how to make the most of it for industry and innovation must be a central issue. The question of the three per cent for research and the question of the European patent are clearly far from insignificant. Fifthly, the questions of finance for businesses, especially SMEs and risk capital, cannot be overlooked either. Sixthly, implementation of this industrial policy must include the dimension of dialogue between management and labour: a good industrial policy can only come about in cooperation with employers and worker representatives and certainly not in opposition to them or without them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, other crucial factors we should mention are education, training and skills: human resources or human capital are in fact increasingly important for industrial competitiveness. That is why I am proposing that the European Union launch an ambitious initiative, such as setting a target figure for expenditure on lifelong learning. The role of large European industrial projects involving private operators and public funding, like Galileo, should also be underlined where key sectors like alternative or renewable energy, nanotechnologies, space and steel are concerned. The technology platforms initiative seems to me to be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also all aware of the need for a good transport, energy and communications network if we are to make the most of the potential of the large single European market. With the Union expanding to include regions that are not so well served, we need to give some thought to the necessity of increasing significantly the resources available to pay for the major works required. I think last week’s European Council also confirms this view.</p>
<p class="contents">A good European industrial policy must not only take the opportunities offered by the new sectors of the future, but must also be capable of anticipating change in the traditional sectors so as to best manage the restructuring at both social, territorial and economic levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has sketched out a sectoral analysis. That is a significant and welcome change from the purely horizontal approach. It would, however, be desirable not to stop at the sectoral analysis but to use it as a basis for sectoral action. The subject of industrial policy is therefore at the heart of our debates. You only have to read the conclusions of the last European Council. I join my colleague in hoping that we will get past the stage of incantatory declarations and move on to determined and fruitful action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me start with industrial policy before I move to entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to know that you share the view that the manufacturing industry needs to be put back at the top of the policy agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Manufacturing drives the growth of the service sector. Therefore it is also important as ever in the knowledge and service economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to work towards a balanced approach to sustainable development, where the three pillars – economic, social and environmental – are balanced and progress in parallel. If we fail with the economy – if we do not have competitive companies – the whole of sustainable development is in danger. If economic development is poor, we fail to meet social and environmental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, such competitiveness relies, above all, on the specific assets of Europe, such as skilled human resources and technological advance, two points which your report rightly emphasises.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report also calls for further action to implement the ideas contained in the communication. Let me summarise briefly what the Commission has done so far, before turning to how we view the future.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on the screening process, it consists of looking at how various EU policies contribute to the objectives of industrial policy, and how this contribution could be improved or reinforced. The screening process is well under way. We have already identified a number of policy areas where synergies could be greatly improved. I will give you three examples: regional policy, which can be mobilised more systematically both to promote a culture of innovation and to facilitate the management of industrial change; employment policy, where the social dialogue, at horizontal and sectoral level, has a useful role to play in helping to deal with industrial policy issues; and research and development policy, where the implementation of the so-called ‘3% action plan’ has direct relevance from an industrial policy standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to industrial policy at the sectoral level, the Commission is putting together a package of activities to address the sectoral dimension of industrial competitiveness. The Commission will strengthen the analytical basis of our policy through constant monitoring of sectoral competitiveness, and in-depth analysis of selected sectors. When necessary, specific initiatives aiming to improve the competitive situation of the sectors will be proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already working on a number of specific, sectoral initiatives, for example in the area of pharmaceuticals, aerospace and biotechnology strategy, with others to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">The textile sector is one of the first sectors undergoing an in-depth competitive analysis of the type described in the communication. Next week the Commission will adopt a communication on the future challenges of the textile and clothing sector. I know that there are many Members of Parliament for whom this is an extremely important priority.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the maritime industries will also be the subject of such an initiative and next week the ‘Leadership 2015’ programme will be presented. The Commission will make a communication on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also launched a technology platform on the future of mobile technologies and systems in Europe. That report will be ready in January. This is just an example of how horizontal policies and vertical sectoral solutions complement each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the future, the Commission will need to report on the steps it has taken to implement the ideas and principles contained in the communication. We will do that early next year. We need to address in more detail and in a more operational way, issues such as: mobilising the appropriate policy tools to deal with the industrial consequences of enlargement; the international dimension of industrial policy, for example in the context of the Commission initiative ‘Wider Europe, Neighbourhood’.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to deepen the reflection on how to improve the linkage between EU industrial policy and the industrial policies of the Member States. In that area the Member States retain the bulk of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently working on an integrated competitiveness strategy at the request of the Competitiveness Council. I hope we will be able to present that in November. This will combine various elements, such as R&amp;D policy, the internal market and competition policy, with industrial policy. It is clear that there is a need to ensure close coordination between these various policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will be able to continue to count on Parliament’s support in our endeavours to ensure that industrial policy stays at the top of the EU policy agenda. When we have economically challenging times, we are more serious. We must make this a permanent approach towards industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning entrepreneurship, I agree with Mr Langen, throughout all of his speech. The encouragement of entrepreneurship and business creation is essential to building European competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">To understand better how we might exploit Europe’s entrepreneurial potential and to help establish a European agenda for entrepreneurship policy, we published the Green Paper ‘Entrepreneurship in Europe’. It called on national and regional policy-makers, business organisations, advisors, academics and think-tanks to provide their own opinions and suggestions in a subsequent consultation. This raised a number of questions with regard to two issues for Europe which, to my mind, are critical.</p>
<p class="contents">First, why do so few people start a business, when a relatively large number of individuals express their appreciation and respect for entrepreneurship? Why do so few make an effort themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, why do so few European SMEs see growth as an opportunity instead of pure risk? We need more people to start enterprises and we need more SMEs that want to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation stirred the interest of a large number of stakeholders across Europe and beyond. Now we are working on an action plan on the basis of this consultation. The action plan will be presented at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect to build the Action Plan around three priorities: first of all, reducing barriers for Europe’s existing entrepreneurs, an issue of particular concern to SMEs; secondly, unlocking the ambition of these enterprises for growth; and thirdly, encouraging more new entrepreneurial initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Action Plan will suggest a limited number of key actions to be undertaken both by the Commission and the Member States. The role of the Member States is fundamental. For many policy areas where action is needed, competence lies at national or regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Appropriate follow-up mechanisms and supporting measures will have to be in place in order to trigger or monitor progress. For this purpose, one should build on existing or adapted reporting mechanisms, such as the Charter Implementation report, which we have discussed here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the debate in the House today, even though it is late at night. I call on the European Parliament to support this important initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While we note that the execution of these budget lines is generally acceptable, quantitatively speaking – the rates of execution are perfect – the same cannot always be said of the quality of budget execution, especially as regards very small businesses and the craft trades. It seems to us – and you know we have already said so on a number of occasions – that the Commission is having difficulty in finding ways of channelling funds to this kind of business, be it funds from the European Investment Bank for normative and environmental investments and investments in new technologies, or the experimental funds, especially in the matter of employment law in the enterprise. We therefore consider it very important that this gap should be filled, because very small businesses and the craft trades make up more than 90% of European enterprises and they are both the creators of jobs and the sources of innovation you want to see. All such businesses are therefore actively involved in achieving the Lisbon objectives and in the spirit of those objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">These entrepreneurs, both men and women, deserve the Commission’s special attention given their importance for the stability of the socio-economic fabric, the continuity of employment and the risks that they take. These initiatives are not simply the work of individuals who are prepared to take risks, they are also the fruit of a general environment that provides equality of opportunity. It is also up to us to encourage entrepreneurship by creating the conditions that are favourable to business creation. I hope that in the years ahead we will be able to provide the <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> means for achieving these objectives, which are essential for the fulfilment of our great dynamic vision for the Union’s economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can only say, it was about time. Our compatriots are worried. They have the feeling that our industrial fabric is unravelling day after day. They note bitterly that too many businesses are closing or moving elsewhere, often to the Far East, to neighbouring Member States or to the future Member States sometimes. What is Europe doing, they ask us, what are you doing?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this concern is justified and the question is a legitimate one: do we not speak of a social market economy, of social cohesion? They therefore judge the situation in the light of our laudable objectives. That is why Mrs Zrihen should be congratulated for writing her own-initiative report: it is a difficult subject. The rapporteur has included most of the opinions of the committees consulted, in particular our own, that of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I cannot criticise her for doing that, but it has sometimes resulted in something like a Prévert-style inventory and the poor Commission is sometimes asked to work miracles. Especially as there are many obstacles to an effective industrial policy and some of those obstacles are outside its competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The first obstacle seems to me to be that the Union puts too much faith in market mechanisms. Moderate protectionism, a greater acceptance of public intervention and a distinction between competition and predation ought to be enough to correct the mysterious hand’s perverse effects.</p>
<p class="contents">A second obstacle is fiscal and social differences. Sadly, social and fiscal dumping hang over the Union. But essentially that is a question where the Member States retain full sovereignty; competition will not be fair until there is harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">A third obstacle is the low level of expenditure on research and investment: we spend 1.07% of GDP while the Japanese, it appears, spend 3%.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am not convinced that enlargement is the answer to all our ills. Perhaps we talk about it too optimistically. In the face of all these obstacles and difficulties, I can only wish the Commission and ourselves good luck and good courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not forget that we are back here with the very foundations of European integration. It was the integration of the key industrial sectors of the time, coal and steel, that sealed our destiny as a Community. Since then, our industrial policy ambitions have, however, fallen short because only the commercial approach, that of competition and free trade, has prevailed, and I concede that this has brought benefits. One of the results, in the context of the far-reaching and inevitable industrial changes we are experiencing, has, however, been a complete failure to anticipate their effects, especially in terms of employment, and the waves of collective redundancies we are seeing everywhere in the Europe of the Fifteen bear witness to that, as has just been underlined. Tomorrow, it will affect the countries joining the European Union if we do not respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Our declared ambitions for growth, more and better jobs and social cohesion, to quote the Lisbon objectives, need us to define a new industrial policy for the Union. That is crucial both for employment and for the Union’s social and territorial cohesion. Both sides of industry are willing to participate in defining those objectives as part of a genuine action plan, as the report recommends.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress two points on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, first of all the question of industrial competitiveness. This is central and cannot be reduced to cost cutting alone, as some seem to think. It is a composite idea that must take full account of the principles on which the European social model is based, namely all the social factors mentioned by Mrs Zrihen just now, and I am not going to repeat them. Those factors are quite different from objective costs. They are productive factors in their own right and must be given the same attention as the development of research and the application of new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the need to promote an integrated industrial policy: major European projects, the promotion of technology platforms, etc. must go hand in hand with territorial approaches in terms of territorial balance and consistency with employment policies, whether it be in the framework of the open coordination method or of more binding procedures, as Mr Langen seems to want.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the lack of an industrial policy and therefore of the benefits that might be expected from it, is one of the reasons why many of our European fellow citizens are increasingly losing confidence in our institutions, including this one, since we are supposed to represent them in their most legitimate interests, the first of which is employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that the company must be in credit, but it also means being in the black yourself, in the interests of your family and your own self-esteem. I worked as a blacksmith for fifteen years, and during that time, I learned that it is not just a matter of being in the black; the most important thing is by how much you are in credit. In other words, how much equity can you build up in the company? Is your family happy with the income you have achieved, and how much provision for the future can you make through your own efforts?</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, when considering entrepreneurs’ income, we must distinguish three separate factors. First of all, there is the fair wage for the work. If someone is working 40, 50, 60 or 80 hours a week, a fair wage basis must be applied. I think that in this respect, the entrepreneur should be treated the same way as an employee, in that the minimum wage should always be tax-free. The entrepreneur has invested capital. The Green Paper says nothing about the fact that equity should really be interest-bearing and how it should be taxed. Ultimately, the entrepreneur bears the risk, the risk of the many liabilities he has to assume.</p>
<p class="contents">But nor does the Green Paper mention the liabilities which entrepreneurs have to assume today as a result of the ‘<span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>’. What is needed here, therefore, is a fair assessment of performance, and here we need the Competition Council, which will make it possible, quite simply, to shape these fair competition conditions in future.</p>

As we have heard, the current challenge for the European Union is to identify key factors for building a climate in which entrepreneurial business activities can succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">People's attitudes towards involvement in entrepreneurship vary widely across the European Union, as we have heard from Commissioner Liikanen, although on average the European Union has no lack of business owners. In Lisbon, the European Union made a commitment to become more competitive and dynamic, but this commitment is still an abstract concept, and implementation is well behind schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">While I fully support the Lisbon aims, we need a stronger commitment by the Member States. The entrepreneurship paper clearly has a central role to play in this. However, we need to be aware that Europe still underperforms compared to the US and Australia in terms of number of new businesses. Clearly, if the European Union is to achieve the Lisbon goals for employment and prosperity, the situation for entrepreneurs will need to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of doing this is to tackle the main barriers. Many enterprises are facing obstacles such as cultural and social barriers, barriers posed by regulation – both from the European Union and national legislation, access to finance and education and training, and, of course, some of the negative media impact.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is that these barriers are currently damaging the potential contribution, both economic and social, of small firms within the European Union. But why is it that entrepreneurship is important? In my region, in the West Midlands, I have seen how SMEs offer us an opportunity to engage in issues of productivity and competition and, at the same time, they give us the tools to empower disadvantaged groups, reduce social exclusion and contribute to regeneration. But we cannot see this just as an end in itself. It has to be a means to an end, and it is important that entrepreneurship focuses. It enables emerging firms to be more efficient and more dynamic and continue to thrive.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we to achieve this? Some steps have already been taken to remove some of the barriers faced by entrepreneurs. However, we need to give stronger direction to the Commission and Member States on many of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is that although the stigma of failure for entrepreneurs is widely recognised as a problem within Europe, this is not being effectively tackled. Entrepreneurship is first and foremost a mindset, and it is very difficult to legislate for a mindset. You cannot force peopled to become entrepreneurs, but we can legislate and create the right framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard from Mr Langen about the EU citizen being more risk-averse than his American counterpart. We need to look at other communities within the EU to make sure that we learn the lessons. A couple of months ago, I chaired a conference for the Commission for involvement of ethnic minority entrepreneurs. That is a very good way for us to learn why certain communities are more entrepreneurial than the Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It takes some courage to say there is a very serious risk of de-industrialisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The desire to build a powerful industry was at the heart of the ECSC and then of the European Economic Community. But we have not had an industrial policy for more than ten years now.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we fail to question a profoundly biased position, which sets the creation of the single market against the role of the State, horizontal action against sectoral action? Each of our Member States is managing its restructuring as it is able. There is no desire to promote the European productive system as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of an industrial policy is therefore becoming a matter of public interest. We must make it a social choice. It will be impossible for European growth to recover without boosting industry. It would, moreover, be foolish to count on services alone, because it is innovation and productivity, in industry and around it, that create the added value necessary for services to grow. If national policies continue to diverge, Europe will be incapable of being a base camp for our enterprises in globalisation and the challenge of competitiveness will be lost. So I am for entrepreneurship, without a doubt, but I think enterprise can only develop if we create the collective conditions for growth in Europe. That is the advantage of the action plan that has been suggested to us, that is why we need sectoral European projects, a revision of the guidelines for competition policy and Community aids, a commercial policy that is more favourable to our development, and the ability to create partnerships around territorial communities. So far as small businesses in particular are concerned, creating them is not enough. Europe’s problem is that they are not growing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is good to measure the effects before legislating, but we must not over-regulate either. The important thing now is to try to build European leaders that will be the foundations for sustainable development. I will end with a word about method. This recovery will not be possible without involvement and I therefore call for a strategic dialogue between both sides of industry, public authorities and the Community institutions.</p>

The Greens are grateful to Mrs Zrihen for reminding us that Europe used to be based on three pillars: environmental, social and economic. We find that quite a number of our conservative friends, some liberals and unfortunately also some socialists are forgetting, or are trying to forget, Gothenburg and the need to include the environment. We cannot go back to the scientism of the 1960s and industrial policies that included no risk assessment or ecology, which are the very foundation of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, as Greens, we want a better targeted research policy and are very much looking forward, impatiently, to the DG Environment’s document on environmental technologies, which has been promised for December, because environmental technologies are one of the responses to future world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing we need is social cohesion. One point on which there really is a dividing line in our Assembly is that some believe that creativeness can be created by confusing a large proportion of European citizens. As Greens, we believe that Europe’s strength lies in its fabric and its social cohesion: we have to preserve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing we must maintain and develop is the non-market sector. It is absolutely clear that the market sector rests on the non-market and that Europe lacks a non-market policy in areas like education, infrastructure and creativeness.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, world trade policy. I think that with India, China and Russia we are witnessing a new momentum in world politics: these are countries with a very good level of education. They are therefore going to have engineers, but for decades they will be paid much less than ours. How are we going to deal with this reality in a world where we give priority only to competition instead of partnerships? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Green Paper on entrepreneurship in Europe tackles many of the important issues and points the way to the essential growth and job creation that are required at the present time. This is a key element of the Lisbon strategy: aiming to become the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economic region by the year 2010. The international index of entrepreneurs indicates clearly that there are shortcomings in the EU that must be dealt with. Last week's European Council discussed the Lisbon agenda, and I particularly welcome the key issues of investing in human capital, innovation, research and development and skills that were addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">As a public representative coming from one of Europe's most peripheral regions, I am heartened to read in the Council conclusions that recognition is given to the special needs of such regions. Specific attention must be devoted to the needs of innovative SMEs that operate on the technological boundary and to technology transfers to peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new information society, peripherality need not be a drawback. If the right infrastructure is put in place, notably broadband, and adequate investment is made in providing skills training, then regions like the west and north of Ireland can compete on a more equal basis with central locations.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an investment is crucial for Europe's growth potential. If we are to reach our Lisbon goals, we must concentrate on mobilising investment and getting the right regulatory conditions. We must seek to provide research infrastructures such as science parks, industrial innovation, research and development projects and information and communication technologies. Member States will also need to work towards the 3% budget target posed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what we need is a joined-up approach which goes across a range of policy areas. I am convinced that it is the small, local project that offers the greatest potential and that we must particularly aim at an improved framework for small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet when it comes down to brass tacks, many politicians – national and European – forget what they are supposed to stand for and ultimately vote in favour of tax increases, more bureaucracy and more complex legal provisions. That is also a major reason why small and medium-sized enterprises are not growing in the way that we would expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s motion for a resolution on market rules for the self-employed is a vivid example of this game with marked cards. It claims to work in the interests of stakeholders, and yet in reality, it is intended to achieve exactly the opposite effect. Both market access and the operation of new and smaller freelance business are likely to be substantially impeded as a result of this initiative. I regard the postponement of today’s vote on this motion as a positive sign that some of our fellow Members have recognised this hypocrisy and are taking action against it by lobbying for genuine improvements for small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Achieving this objective requires the existence of a broad and dynamic company fabric essentially composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, since these are best suited to the challenges of an environment which is constantly mutating and thereby responding to the concerns of the citizens in relation to employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to guarantee the maintenance of this fabric, it is not sufficient, however, to guarantee the smooth operation, for example, of the internal market, or to implement a commercial policy which ensures the opening up of third country markets in a reciprocal fashion, or to implement an industrial policy which takes account of the specific needs of the different sectors, however important all this may be. In this regard, Commissioner, please allow me to express my satisfaction at your announcement of a forthcoming communication on the textile and clothing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as all these aspects I have referred to, we must also encourage the entrepreneurial spirit and promote the creation of companies and a favourable climate which allows them to develop and grow; without companies there can be no entrepreneurial fabric. Hence the timeliness of the Commission's Green Paper and the Langen report, which is the subject of this debate, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reaffirm the importance and value of small and medium-sized businesses as a basic pillar of the European economy and promote the establishment of an environment which guarantees the appropriate training of entrepreneurs, stimulates the creation of companies, promotes their growth, their competitiveness and eliminates the legislative, administrative and fiscal obstacles which hinder entrepreneurial activity in line with the very appropriate proposals in the Langen report. Otherwise, the Lisbon objectives, which – let us not forget – should lead to the creation, between now and 2010, of 15 million jobs and greater social cohesion, will be reduced to mere wishes that are impossible to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement makes it even more necessary, and that policy cannot be reduced to competition policy alone. Competition policy alone can neither respond to the social challenges and to the risk of sudden relocations to areas of low taxation and low wage costs, nor can it satisfy the ambition of having an excellent innovative industry with a high level of skill and added value providing a large number of quality jobs. This ambition of excellence ought to be ours for the present Member States as for the candidate countries. We must reject any kind of fatalism that says Europe is doomed to de-industrialise or to see its industries concentrated in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe alone.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Herzog said, I do not believe that the answer to this vision of renunciation or to the illusion of a European economy that will remain strong if it concentrates exclusively on services but loses many technological trump cards lies solely in entrepreneurship; we must also look for the answer in genuine industrial strategies, which are still hard to discern in the Commission communication. A real industrial policy must be based on large projects and sustained strategies in sectors combining, for example, research and development efforts with the creation of European champions. By encouraging groupings, for example, we could create champions capable of acting on a world scale, drawing after them a whole sector of job-creating SMEs. When that has happened in the past, it has been on the basis of intergovernmental and not Community initiatives. We can think of Airbus, the defence industries or Arianespace, while there are many other fields – you mentioned several – where much more aggressive and vigorous action would be required. I think it is up to the Commission to take initiatives in this respect, although, it is true, we need to give it the competences to do so. Perhaps we should have an industrial policy Commissioner alongside the competition Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as Mrs Zrihen has said, this industrial policy, including the aspect of competitiveness, must form part of a social vision. There are essential questions that cannot be avoided here. I will mention tax harmonisation, the conditions of social harmonisation, especially after enlargement, and worker representation in large European groups, without which there will be no real social dialogue. In this connection, the revised directive on European works councils is still blocked, even though it has been approved by Parliament. Finally, I will mention policy on lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end on this point by pointing out that in our businesses, in our countries, it is easier to give training opportunities to people who are already very highly qualified than to the least well qualified persons. That is why I hope that our Assembly will vote by a very large majority in favour of Mrs Zrihen’s report and that the Commission will take note of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He will have my full support, but what we need most of all, if Europe is to provide the environment which will foster entrepreneurship, is a complete change in attitudes to success and to failure.</p>
<p class="contents">In America, the down-and-out who passes by the tycoon's lavish mansion will aspire to match him. In Europe he would probably pass snide comments or call on the government to tax him out of business. Envy and disparagement are the enemy of success and of a successful enterprise economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In America, the entrepreneur who fails will be given credit for trying and gaining experience for the next time. The bankrupt will be helped to recover his self-esteem and the determination to try again. In Europe, he would be abandoned in legal and financial limbo. He will be pilloried and shamed, his chances of a second try constrained.</p>
<p class="contents">Seldom will the innovator, the inventor or the enterprising individual possess all the necessary financial means and business skills which are necessary for full and enduring success. This is where the business angel, the friendly adviser, the non-executive director become essential.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am particularly pleased that paragraph 34 of Mr Langen's report highlights the role of business angels. That is why I ask the whole of Parliament for its support for Amendment 7, which expresses our concern at the tendency to persecute non-executive directors who are such an essential ingredient in a successful enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be forgiving of honest failure. Let us encourage that first try, that second try, the will to keep on trying. Let us praise success and be pleased to see the rewards of success in our most enterprising fellow citizens. Only then will we achieve a true enterprise culture in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the vast majority of EU Member States, on the other hand, the prevailing attitude is one of risk-averse pessimism as a result of poor economic data and many heralded but unimplemented reforms. Europe will be more capable of holding its own in global competition if there are far more business start-ups, for example. Mr Langen has presented a very sound analysis of the Commission’s Green Paper and proposed substantial improvements. Let us learn from best practices, for example from Ireland, which is among the world leaders, in terms of its business start-ups, thanks to lean bureaucracy, a simple taxation system, and active promotion of entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">Support must not only be given to new start-ups, however. Existing companies, crafts and family business also need to be promoted – an issue on which the report touched only marginally. We are in favour of an action plan for entrepreneurship, to be produced by the end of 2003, with feasible proposals, a binding timeframe, and the Charter for Small Enterprises as an integral element. Ask an expert, the President of SME Global, our fellow Member Mr Rübig! Let us be clear: enterprises need direct and uncomplicated access to funds, from the provision of risk capital to loans from the EIB and the EDF. When starting up, they need tax breaks, and when problems subsequently arise, they need relief from taxation and bureaucracy. They need the requisite transfer of innovation and technologies, and as our friend Mr Purvis has rightly pointed out, they need support from business angels. I know many of them. We also need support for European networking.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the rising unemployment figures, we have no more time to lose. The political framework conditions must be in place so that enterprises can actually act in an enterprising manner again. If managers and workforce alike have clear prospects, they will be willing to be more flexible and mobile.</p>

<p class="contents">We must clarify that, if entrepreneurship does not develop at a fast rate in the EU, we shall have to definitively forget the Lisbon objectives as of now.</p>
<p class="contents">Only if entrepreneurship develops can the scourge of unemployment be combated and the wealth of the EU increased for the benefit, mainly, of the less well off.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, governments must simplify bureaucratic procedures now, create company-friendly tax systems and take pains to create a temperate business climate in which new companies will flourish and develop.</p>
<p class="contents">Banks must stop being the oppressor of small and medium-sized enterprises and must undertake the useful role as their advisor and supporter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the social perception which the leftist ideology has been cultivating for years now, that profit is the demon and enemy of society, must be overturned immediately and definitively. It must become the common conviction that profit means recompense for the person making an effort, taking risks, working day and night, who is ambitious and capable of something better. Profit is the driving force which creates entrepreneurship and results in the advancement of individuals, peoples and states.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I am pleased to see the growing and increasingly visible recognition given by our Parliament to these key players in the European economy, and in particular by the Committee on Industry, which now never misses an opportunity to encourage this phenomenon. My colleague Mr Langen’s report says a lot about the part played by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which has brought about definite improvements to the Commission Green Paper on ‘Entrepreneurship in Europe’, thanks among other things to the many amendments we put through together with my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Finally, the spirit that drives entrepreneurs, large or small, is given a definition that will enable measures to be put in place to simplify the red tape involved in the creation and operation of businesses, their transfer and the essential forms of tax relief. There is, however, still much to be done, like drawing up a European specification for businesses, better representation for SMEs in Community think tanks, aid mechanisms for their internationalisation, etc. and I expect our work will continue in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
