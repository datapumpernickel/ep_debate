Indeed, it was agreed earlier with all the political parties that we would discuss this prior to voting in view of the urgency with which the material was presented and since we had no time for a debate. It is a very important matter. I therefore regret that we did not get that opportunity. For the rest, I will submit the substance of our contribution in writing. But what concerns us is that we think it very important, where this proposal is concerned, that a judicial review should take place. We are delighted with this proposal from the Committee. We are pleased that it is based on Article 308 of the Treaty. This means that there is a role for the Court of Justice and this means that there is a role for the European Parliament. We are very disappointed in the Council’s rejection yesterday of this legal basis. The Council has not understood the urgency of this proposal and has also failed to understand the need to base it on Article 308. By wishing to base it on various articles of the Third Pillar, the Council of course wants to exclude both the Court of Justice and the European Parliament. It is a serious matter that should most certainly have been discussed in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did of course scrupulously apply the Rules of Procedure. I have to say that I was expecting every group to ask me for this minute of speaking time. It was not my job to grant it by virtue of an agreement made in the corridors. In fact, what should have happened and what I was expecting was for a number of Members, 32 to be precise, in order to comply with the Rules of Procedure, to request a debate, which in any case was not possible because we had voted on the topical and urgent debate and at that point the groups asked me for a minute each. Mr Wurtz was the only one to make this request. I was the most surprised of all, Mrs Buitenweg.</p>

We recognise the need to react quickly but believe, at the same time, that thorough reflection is important. The proposal for a regulation is an expression of the fact that the EU is in a position to take action, but not to reflect. If we are not voting against Parliament’s approval of the initiative, it is for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we do not believe that Parliament should be consulted on this issue, on which it has no influence. We think it is completely unacceptable that Parliament should take a view on a regulation proposed by the Commission on the basis of the paper before us, which has been presented in a hurry and which Coreper criticises for lack of cohesion and consistency. We believe that the procedure whereby Parliament is asked to approve the hasty adoption of the Council proposal is being used by the Council to legitimise a regulation on which thorough work has not been done.</p>
<p class="contents">The list attached to the proposal in Annex 1 is of organisations and individuals suspected of being directly or indirectly involved in acts of terrorism. In our view, the fact that a list prepared in the United States has been approved without hesitation is a matter for criticism. The proposal contains no guidelines as to how, or in accordance with which criteria, individuals or organisations are to be added to, or crossed off, the list, and it has not been specified which authorities are authorised to draw up the list and according to what principles.</p>
<p class="contents">We would criticise the fact that the proposal invalidates fundamental principles of a society governed by law, principles that protect those who have been accused against unfair and unlawful treatment. It is a fact beneath contempt that the traditional, threefold division of power into legislative, judicial and executive authorities has been invalidated so that the EU can comply with the United States’ desire for rapid intervention. At the same time, it must be emphasised that no infringement of these principles can justify acts of terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, both the decision process and content of the regulation constitute an insult to that very democracy and rule of law whose protection is claimed to be the aim of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been forced into rushed action without any reports, debate or access to the text of the legislation in many languages, including Swedish. No positive reason has been given to explain why normal forms of democratic decision-making have to be bypassed. As it is the Member States which in the final analysis will implement the proposed freezing of suspected terrorists’ financial assets and as this must in any case be carried out through measures within each Member State, there is nothing to suggest that an EU regulation is required or that it will speed up the implementation of necessary measures.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the regulation is a legal rush job and a mockery of all the grand statements to the effect that the fight against terrorism should not be perceived as a war against Islam or the Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation contains no definition of terrorism, terrorists or terror organisations whatsoever. Instead of the legislating body operating in the normal legal way by formulating a general definition of the crime and leaving it to the judicial system to trace, arrest, prosecute and judge those whose actions correspond to the definition of the crime confirmed by law, the legislating body, i.e. the Commission as proposer, the Council as decision-maker and the European Parliament as the body considering the proposal, has pre-empted the application of the law and circumvented the need for a definition of the crime by instead directly announcing 27 ‘guilty’ organisations and people.</p>
<p class="contents">The origin of this list cannot be traced to any legal procedure whatsoever, but comes from the CIA. The list contains a number of names with no more specific information – names which probably belong to several people. In addition, all the names on the list are easily identifiable as Arabic/Muslim.</p>
<p class="contents">The result has been a diversion which is not needed in order for necessary measures to be taken in EU countries against terrorists’ financial assets, which breaches fundamental legal principles and which must also be perceived as a one-sided political attack on the Muslim/Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its decision to adopt a number of amendments, the European Parliament has pointed to possible ways of partly, but far from entirely, reducing the deficiencies to which attention has been called. I believe it would have been more just of the European Parliament in this situation to have shown its dissatisfaction unambiguously by recommending the complete rejection of the Commission’s proposal. In this way, the Commission would have been able to return with a new proposal which would have genuinely increased the chances of fighting terrorism, would have been based on legal principles and would have ruled out any suspicion that the proposal is one-sidedly directed against the Arabic/Muslim world.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I, like a number of my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the proposal in the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not been given any proof of the activities of these 27, not even the slightest explanation of why precisely these 27 should be judged without evidence and without trial. What is being required of us is that we undertake to judge these 27 with blindfolds on – definitively and with no recourse to appeal. We are to wield the rubber stamp here and now and, in classic Dr Strangelove style, shoot first and ask questions afterwards. Are not democratic principles of law precisely what we wish to defend?

We did not wait for Mr Bush to denounce tax havens, but under no circumstances will we give his secret services a blank cheque. The list, put forward with no explanation and which, we are warned, will be extended, no doubt in line with the interests of the USA and its allies, is only an alibi list when compared with the battle as a whole, against both tax havens and the perpetrators of death who profit from them. As we definitely do not have the same definition of terrorism as Mr Bush, and as the list of the guilty remains open, we propose that the company TotalFinaElf should be added to it as the 28th organisation, as it is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths around the world and is directly linked to terrorist activities, particularly in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When ex-terrorists became the leaders of South Africa, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and a very large number of former colonies, they suddenly became reasonable and respectable people in the eyes of many, and their former opponents were blamed – rightly so – for causing the violence. By nipping in the bud every prospect of peaceful means towards a better life, they had driven the opposition to desperation. That is why we must always draw a sharp distinction between opposition, in particular, campaigns resulting in socio-economic and administration changes, and irrational violence, which is only aimed at bringing about fear and destruction. The American list of 27 suspected organisations with an Islamic background raises in some cases the suspicion that the support of governments in the battle against international terrorism is being bought by labelling their internal opponents terrorists as well. We are, then, committing the same error as in making abortion, euthanasia and trading in soft drugs by inhabitants of Member States indictable offences where these are permitted by the legal administrations of other Member States. In the justified battle against real terrorism, not everything now being proposed is fair and appropriate – not by a long chalk. I do not agree with this ill-considered approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is possible to proceed against them, even without a judicial process or final proof. Such a measure would be comparable with being remanded in custody, when suspects have not yet been found guilty in a court of law. If no evidence of guilt is found, prisoners on remand are released and paid compensation. No such provision is envisaged here.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the clause contained in Article 2(2) enables other unpopular persons and organisations to be included on this legally dubious list. Given that the Justice and Home Affairs Council has already talked about urban violence in connection with terrorism, I fear that this will make it possible to freeze the bank accounts of individuals or organisations who demonstrate against the EU's policies at European Councils, for example.</p>

It is not the case that we think these measures in themselves constitute a total, satisfactory and coherent response to the formidable threat we face. We simply think that it is a first step in the right direction and that we now need to tackle, without delay or taboos, the task of generally reviewing our legislation so that the intention expressed by the Presidency of the Council to conduct a policy against terrorism that is both ‘global’ and ‘sustainable’ does not remain some kind of mantra, but is something that can be translated into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, some of the proposals made here yesterday by Minister Michel concern us, because they reflect the persistence among some of our leaders, despite the events of 11 September, of the same ‘old way of thinking’, to use Mr Gorbachev’s expression, of the same ideological vein which for years has inspired, at European level, lax and demagogical measures with regard to the movement of people, which have led to us giving up control of our territory and have made the European Union an epicentre for Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Michel asserts that the wide-ranging legislative review advocated by our fellow member Mr Berthu that aims to make the safety of our people a priority ‘leads straight towards a liberticidal society’, he is adding to this confusion that is the root of all of our shortcomings. Is it not as a result of seeing every removal of controls as a step towards freedom that we have paved the way for terrorists such as those who went on to attack the United States? The fact that any serious measure of control, particularly if it is a national measure, is still seen as a liberticidal proposal, says a great deal about how far there is to go before the old libertarian ideology is abandoned and before the debate can rise to the challenges we are having to face as a result of current events.</p>

You can only combat terrorism by helping to remove the breeding ground for violence, not by causing yet more outrage. The way in which Israel seeks out and liquidates violent Palestinian opponents only appears to evoke more sympathy for violent resistance. There is now the threat of that very mistake being repeated on a global scale. When it comes to matters of climate, armament and racism, the US President sought isolation. The formation of a coalition of the rich and powerful, led by him, against the poor and rebellious will be counter-productive in the long run. I side with the only American politician who had the courage to vote against the warmongering, following in the footsteps of those few German socialist dissenters at the beginning of the First World War. The money we are about to waste on war would be better spent on prevention. Within Europe, this would involve making ourselves as secure as possible against attacks, something which would be possible if we did not privatise airport security and air traffic safety and if we paid closer attention to safety standards for very tall buildings. Outside of Europe, it would involve helping to solve the problems of poverty, neglect and injustice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We see no connection between the need for a resolute response to the recent terrorist attacks and the call for intensification of efforts to operationalise the European Security and Defence Policy. On the contrary, recent events underline the need for stronger transatlantic ties, and an enhancement of NATO, rather than the potentially divisive pursuit of some autonomous EU military capability. In addition, we wish to ensure that any new counter-terrorist legislation is also used to bear down on those terrorist organisations, such as the IRA in all its forms, and ETA, that have been conducting terrorist campaigns from and within EU Member States over the past several decades. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘stability pact’ and the anti-democratic powers that the European Central Bank has been given operate in an extremely restrictive fashion, at a time when radical change in the direction of European integration is becoming particularly pressing.

<p class="contents">The Ecofin Council, however, once again demonstrated its inability to communicate. It did not make any proposal in proportion to what is at stake. Its debates continue to be characterised by a total lack of transparency and responsibility, as illustrated by the fate of the Tobin tax. Ministers went back on their public commitments in referring the matter to the Commission, which we know is hostile to such a decision, no matter how elementary it may seem. In the same vein, the burning question of tax havens was only voluntarily broached from the specific angle of the fight against terrorism.

<p class="contents">Many reasons can be given to justify my vote in favour of this report; I shall simply mention them.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account that 98% of homes have a television, the report firstly and quite rightly points out that the social impact of television is becoming increasingly significant, especially for children. Meanwhile, regarding the protection of minors, the report asks the Member States to step up their dialogue, to define common solutions without threatening their independence in terms of national restrictions for the protection of minors.</p>
<p class="contents">This can be put in another way by saying that the audiovisual sector plays an essential role in democracy and informing the people, and is therefore emerging as a reflection of the level of freedom of expression and plurality of ideas that can be expressed and understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the report also highlights the extent to which the audiovisual sector is a leading sector both in the economy and for employment in the European Union: in 1997, the audiovisual sector employed more than a million people in Europe and its revenue should increase by 70% between now and 2005.</p>

This quite pitiful desire to limit damage cannot make us forget that the shackles were put in place with the active support of liberal socialists, particularly in Italy and France.

This, basically, is the conclusion drawn by both the Commission report and the rapporteur's report. Member States are being further restricted in the exercise of economic policy to a framework of decisions taken in advance and national parliaments are required to do no more than observe or, even worse, execute decisions taken by the ΕU. This is an attempt to undermine the workers' facility to react, as they are doing more and more decisively, to the choices made by big business.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC report welcomes the EU's anti-grass roots policy and includes proposals whose sole function is as an alibi for the rampantly neo-liberal economic and social policy of the ΕU and the tragic impact which it has on the lower classes, such as prior agreement on the allocation of fortuitous or exceptional tax revenue – just to make sure nothing is spent on the social security sector. Integrating the "issue of the ageing population" into national budgets is another move in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">While the report posits that unemployment still affects 14 million Europeans and that the economic and social situation has not improved, it remains faithful to the policy of structural change and unemployment sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of the national parliaments in the form of an annual evaluation of the application of the broad economic policy guidelines decided in the European Council and the debate on the stability programmes approved by the Commission and the Council, are no more than a semblance of democracy, the aim of which is to entrap national representations in Community procedures, especially when it is proposed to strengthen the role of the Commission and impose sanctions on Member States which fail to apply the economic policy imposed by Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an attempt to make national institutions accessories to a process which, on the pretext of coordinating economic policies within the broad economic policy guidelines, is further subjugating wage measures and social policy measures in general to the suffocatingly restrictive criteria for cohesion and of the Stability Pact. The Member States are expressly called on to "coordinate their actions and refrain from adopting tax, budgetary or wage policies".</p>
<p class="contents">The break-up of the guaranteed national insurance system, in conjunction with wage cuts and the fact that working hours and costs are arranged to suit employers, are demonstrably increasing poverty and social exclusion among the working classes and reducing the quality and extent of services offered.</p>

<p class="contents">As we all know, the last 30 years have seen an excessive increase in public spending in Europe, which has forced Member States to raise taxes to an unsustainable level. It is, therefore, crucial that we reduce the tax burden, by implementing the reforms necessary to achieve this, so as to improve incentives for employment and for business activity. The attempt that is being made to define a sustainable method of tax relief is, therefore, to be applauded. I hope that the Commission will continue in its efforts to guide national governments’ approach to tax relief, specifically by establishing a ‘code of conduct’.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of trying to ensure that the largest possible proportion of the active population has access to the labour market, it is essential that we abolish the social, fiscal and administrative obstacles preventing women and older people from returning to work and/or from remaining in work. This is particularly important because features of demographic change have been – as the United Nations’ report for 2000 quite rightly points out – a slowdown in the growth of the population of active age and the increase in the population over 65 years old, which raises the enormous concern of maintaining the social security system or even of trying to prevent potential economic hardship arising as a result of having an insufficiently large workforce for our labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important that we give priority to the access of young people to the labour market as well as to lifelong learning, which will require an increase in public and private spending in the fields of education, research and development, along with, of course, the respective structural reforms, so that the effective transition to a knowledge-based society can go ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now that the economic climate is changing due to a persistent wage moderation policy, the report affirms the right to inflict a fresh recession on Europe. It advocates blindly applying a policy that everyone will notice goes against the announced objectives for growth and employment. When the economy slows down, the Stability Pact contributes to the chaos by slowing business down, because in reality it aims to achieve an unemployment level that will bring salaries back down and increase profits.

At times of economic stagnation of growth or when consumption levels fall, there is no sense in talking people into unrealistic optimism. This would be a form of deceit and would lead to recklessness in consumption and risk-bearing investment. It would be better to expand existing governmental provisions or to introduce new ones. This was the method successfully used in America under Roosevelt during the `30s crisis, and with which western Europe was successfully rebuilt after 1945. For that matter, it was also the method by which authoritarian states such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were able to build economies which were much stronger than outsiders had predicted. In all those cases, whether we agreed with them or not, the result was an unexpected number of satisfied people. Instead of learning from that, we now see a reversion to the primitive standpoints of the 19th and early 20th centuries preceding these successes. Tax reductions, in favour of high incomes and big business, are now considered to be positive, while government spending is considered to be very negative. The report by Mrs Peijs fits in with this now predominant trend. As I expect poverty and instability as a result, I am not in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were 345 new mergers in 2000, to quote the report, thanks to increasingly flexible legislation which fosters the creation of large monopolies which acquire dominant market positions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is of no concern to the ΕU. What does concern it is setting a timetable for the definitive liberalisation of the natural gas and electricity markets, speeding up the rate at which the energy, transport and postal services markets are liberalised and safeguarding universal access to services of general interest, in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also concerned with abolishing state aid. However, the desperate attempt to abolish state aid is really an attempt to increase the profits of the already strong players and to consolidate their market position by excluding new competitors and applying the law of the jungle, the law of might is right and the supremacy of monopoly interests.</p>
<p class="contents">State intervention does not, of course, touch the heart of the capitalist system and it often strengthens companies and businesses on a selective basis. However, without state intervention, even with the tiny, balancing role which it can play, the gulf will widen constantly to the detriment of less developed areas and sectors and the poorest sections of society, given that structural measures and denationalisation are carried out not for their benefit but to strengthen the profitability of big business. That is why the constant pressure for measures such as the proposed register of state aid and the subsidy scoreboard is intolerable. All the choices made by big business illustrate how worried it is about the possible renationalisation of competition policy (i.e. control by the Member States, not the Commission of the European Union), which is why the report proposes an international competition system in the framework of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The competition policy applied has resulted in large branches of European industry dismissing workers and losing important shares of the global market and hundreds of thousands of jobs. The disgraceful concentration of power, in strategically important sectors, has put the economy of entire countries in the hands of speculative multinational groups, with everything that implies for the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs has caused unemployment to spiral. The workers are facing the biggest attack yet on their employment and social rights, they are watching their standard of living being eroded, poverty spread and the public sector and productive base in most countries in the Union being restructured and dissolved in the name of rampant and catastrophic competition, in the name of an absolute market economy and in order to promote the monopoly aspirations of big business. That is why protests against globalisation and the prevalence of the uncontrolled rules of the market economy are growing day by day.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the competition policy applied is responsible for all this and we intend to express our complete opposition to it by voting against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The pillar of this Directive is the country of origin approach. When the report before us was discussed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the first time, I was surprised to find that some members of the relevant Committee wanted to call this country of origin approach into question again for online financial services. Yet this is quite absurd. If the European Parliament and the Lisbon European Council have set a deadline of 2005 for establishing an integrated market in financial services, we cannot afford to adopt incoherent legislation or keep re-examining decisions which have already been taken, unless we have very good reason to do so. This applies not only to some Members of this House but also to the Council, whose vote last Thursday on the Directive on Distance Marketing of Financial Services I greatly regret. We opted for the country of origin approach – so we should now apply it in a targeted and coherent fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to join the rapporteur in congratulating the Commission on its initiative in establishing the European Extrajudicial Network (EEJ-NET) and the Financial Services Complaints Network (FIN-NET). Simple, cost-effective, non-judicial procedures for cross-border redress can only enhance consumer confidence in the development of cross-border financial services. Naturally, consumers must be made aware of the existence of these networks, and I therefore also support the proposal that all websites providing online financial services should advertise these networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It therefore deserves our full attention to ensuring improvements in its quality and to maintaining employment. The main concerns of the Commission, however, as stated in its communication, focus on establishing an internal market for services, studying the obstacles to the free movement of services across national borders, proposing their removal, and working towards speeding up the liberalisation of postal services, the distance selling of financial services, acquisition proposals and value added tax on digital products.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, as well as agreeing with the Commission proposal, highlights the need to speed up and complete the process of liberalisation in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy, which we are bound to reject, since, in general, this is designed to demote the State to a role of merely regulating the activities of public services, establishing supposedly independent regulatory bodies, which are directly or indirectly controlled by economic and financial groups. By and large, the results of liberalisation are redundancies, increased prices for public service provision, a reduction in the quantity and quality of service provision and the rejection of the right of universal access to public services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Communicable diseases kill around 10 000 people every day in Africa, with 35 million people throughout the world contaminated with Aids. HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis are, therefore, a terrible threat to the social and economic development of the poorest communities, and as Mr Khanbhai argues, require a rapid, effective and wide-ranging response, in which the EU must take the lead. These diseases cause not only human suffering and an extremely high number of deaths, which are in themselves justification enough for such a response, but also cause a drastic reduction in life expectancy and in the labour force, with all the social and economic consequences that this entails They seriously disable large working populations, retard social and economic development and destabilise communities that are already weakened.</p>

Remedies against tropical diseases are often available to foreign tourists from rich countries, but not to the large majority of the local population. Existing medicines, which have worked effectively for many years, are even being withdrawn from the market. The reason for this is the lack of spending power in those countries to buy these medicines. If we see medicines as mere commodities, protected by patent rights which ensure that the cost of earlier development expenditure is forever passed on, there will be no medicines available to poor countries and certainly not to their poorest inhabitants. Such medicines often cost more than the annual income of people living there. The proposals by Mr Khanbhai for international recognition by the EU of the right of developing countries to produce generic treatments for epidemic diseases without having to pay the costs of intellectual property rights, as well as the stimulation of production of treatments for diseases caused by poverty and the periodical review of the TRIPs agreement are essential to reach a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they pale before the sheer extent of the misery and shame suffered by millions of people throughout the world, especially in undeveloped countries, where they are still living in poverty, deprived of even basic access to health, and dying from infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and so on. It is even more of a disgrace when there is the certain prospect – based on official studies and research – that the situation will get worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The acceptance that health is a "global public good", as the report rightly points out, cannot be reconciled with the fact that a large proportion of the world's population is deprived of access to education, housing, employment, food, safe drinking water, conditions of hygiene and health services. More than 5 million people a year die from infectious diseases, mainly in underdeveloped countries, while a handful of multinational pharmaceutical monopolies continue to patent, profit from and speculate with drugs, even going so far as to withdraw drugs which, although they save lives, fall short of profit targets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not right to channel any additional resources for developing research to the private sector in the form of incentives rather than to public research centres. It is insulting and hypocritical to state that the "global public good" of health is being hit particularly hard in underdeveloped countries, while at the same time imposing structural changes on these countries by reducing expenditure on the public service sector, especially the health and education sectors. It is unacceptable to rely on the "charity" of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for action to safeguard this "global good" and to trust in "better cooperation" and "partnership" between the public sector, NGOs and the private sector. Health is a fundamental and inalienable human right, it is the most important factor of social justice and human dignity and it cannot be ruled by market regulations and the laws of profit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of prime and capital importance to use public-sector means to fight disease and secure the right to health. However, a radical approach to the problem involves hitting at the root of poverty, at what sustains and exacerbates it. The report hardly even touches on this sort of solution to the problem, making do with regurgitating constantly repeated "analgesic" announcements and proposals. Overturning the social policy system and policies which apply the established imperialist and monopoly interests which generate and spread poverty and misery, which have no hesitation in crushing and sacrificing entire populations and nations to their cause, is the only solution to the problem. </p>
