It is a regional superpower and has made progress in terms of democracy, as well as contributing to vital peacekeeping military operations to settle regional conflicts. It is also a member of the ACP and the Commonwealth. I have many Nigerians living in London, my constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">Like a number of other countries with co-existing Muslim and Christian communities, such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt, there have been periodic clashes. This most recent outburst of violence in the Nigerian state of Plateau is particularly troubling as not only has the violence been horrendous, but also there is evidence that Islamist extremists have been recruited from neighbouring Muslim countries, such as Chad and Niger, possibly with international Islamic terrorist connections.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, Nigeria is a country divided by ethnic and religious differences and every effort must be made by the government to build solidarity and social cohesion nationally. The introduction of Sharia law since 1999 has been particularly divisive and we have witnessed the imposition – although not yet carried out – of lapidation, or stoning to death sentences on women convicted of the so-called crime of adultery. It is only a matter of time before this issue resurfaces to disturb the consciences again of the western world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, I have personally called in this House for the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth in the event of such a barbaric punishment occurring. After all, the 1999 Nigerian Constitution guarantees total freedom of belief, and the country has signed international convenants on human rights. Therefore, I appeal to the federal and state authorities of this big African country to rapidly re-establish law and order, conduct a full investigation into the identity of the culprits and, in particular, where there has been outside provocation or infiltration, bring all those concerned speedily to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were present as guests along with the ACP conference when Mr Obasanjo 'replaced' the military set-up with a democratic system. Hope was strong and sincere. But since then thousands of people have died in ethnic conflicts and all manner of violent clashes. We were also in Kano, in the north, where a wonderful Islamic culture is flourishing and had the opportunity to compare this culture with that of other regions in the south. But this astonishing diversity of tribes, ethnic groups and cultures risks being submerged in severe armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Oil, which ought to be this large country's blessing, is in fact a curse because it is used mainly to buy arms and set up one power base against another. Smaller groups, like the Ogoni people, are at risk of becoming the victims of all this. I believe that we must take Nigeria seriously in the context of the ACP and that we must closely monitor what is happening in this large country, because it is a kind of Africa in miniature. I hope that the recommendations contained in our resolutions, focusing mainly on the danger of intolerance, the danger of Sharia law in those countries, stoning women and so on, are taken to heart because there is a risk that the whole situation could degenerate further if we are not much more closely engaged in dialogue, but also with strong sanctions if the rules are flouted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the attackers shout at them to surrender and lie face down on the ground, only to kill them mercilessly with machetes and axes? Thousands dead, many tens of thousands fleeing, hundreds of churches burned, fear. The only thing the victims did wrong was to be Christians. These dreadful things are happening in central and northern Nigeria. The perpetrators are, once again, Muslim fundamentalists. Not all of them are Nigerian, some are Islamic mercenaries from Chad and Niger. It has been discovered that some of the funds needed to pay for this sort of horrific murderous spree come from Saudi Arabia. What should be done?</p>
<p class="contents">Further to this resolution, I call on the Nigerian authorities to take immediate effective measures to protect their fellow-citizens, especially Christians, who are continuing to suffer from the ongoing attacks. They must also take steps to put an end to this Islamic terrorism, by preventive action if necessary, and to abolish Sharia law in the twelve states where it has been introduced. If the government does not take firm action to deal with the violence, we would be justified in fearing that Nigeria could become the stage for a religious war. I call on the Council and the Commission to monitor this situation closely and to press the Nigerian authorities to take effective action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which I have the honour of chairing, has repeatedly intervened and denounced the revival of religious hatred in Nigeria, especially against women, with the application of Islamic 'Sharia' law, which even makes provision for sentencing by stoning for adultery, over and above the laws and Constitution of Nigeria and also over and above the Cotonou Agreement and the clauses about respecting human rights and women's rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear, Commissioner, that the Nigerian Government either does not have the power or the political will to impose the 1999 Constitution and the laws on the country. Recent violence by fundamentalists and the outbreak of religious violence in the state of Plateau, which has cost 1 500 people their lives and destroyed 173 churches, is the culmination of a series of bloody events in which Islamic extremists are the protagonists.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the European Commission should exploit its powers and international standing to contribute more actively towards strengthening security, putting an end to the violence and promoting respect for religious tolerance and basic human rights in Nigeria. In other words, we need closer cooperation and pressure on the Nigerian Government and President Obasanjo so that the Constitution and laws are applied in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This oil-producing country,<span class="bold"> </span>where the extreme wealth of a tiny minority contrasts with the extreme poverty of the population, is once again the scene of religious confrontations which, last month, caused 20 deaths when a village was attacked in the state of Plateau, a state principally inhabited by Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, this region has been plunged into a genuine conflict between Islamic and Christian fundamentalists. It is a conflict that has already killed more than 100 people in the region since February. These sad events once again show that poverty and the social divide, added together, constitute the ideal breeding ground for all fundamentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Sharia law is practised in 11 northern states out of the 36 states of the Nigerian Federation. In order to react to the Islamic threat, governors of the South, where animists and Christians are in the majority, have created a forum for the Southern states. There are reports that in all areas, including in the institutions, mechanisms that could lead to a new explosion in the country are being put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, faced with this spiral of violence affecting a battered population, we are anxious strongly to condemn any type of intolerance and religious violence. Since 1999, thousands of people have perished following inter-community confrontations. At the time, the detonator had been the introduction of Sharia law in several northern states.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling on the Nigerian Government to take the necessary measures and find a practical solution designed to bring this ethnic and religious violence to an end as soon as possible. We hope, moreover, that this will not just be one more debate in our institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In contrast to Islam, which is a great world faith, Islamism is a criminal ideology, and a very clear distinction must be drawn between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be careful, though, not to consider these things from one angle alone. As we know, most of the states in West Africa are artificial creations drawn on the map by the colonial powers, so that peoples in the South are divided, two examples being the Ibo and the Ewe, who are Christians and animists and live on both sides of the border. The same can be said of the peoples of the North, the Hausa and Fulbe, most of whom are Muslims and also live in a variety of states. This simply happens to be the way these states’ borders were drawn; never, throughout history, have they corresponded with the ethnic realities. This is something that has to be clear to us, and this is something for which we Europeans really do share responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution quite rightly refers to the state of Plateau. It is in Plateau that these ethnic groups collide, and the situation is made even more acute by economic inequalities and migratory flows. The whole place is a highly unstable melting pot and could easily explode. It also has to be borne in mind that Nigeria is a multi-ethnic state, one of the most populous countries in the world and probably the most populous in Africa, and that there are massive oil interests at stake there, so it really does call for extremely sensitive handling and subtle thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">That notwithstanding, what I would like to say to Mrs André-Léonard<span class="bold"> </span>is that it is taking sophistry a bit too far to say that there is fundamentalism in both the Christian and Islamic camps. There is no Christian fundamentalism in Nigeria. There is no Islamic fundamentalism there either; there is, instead, on the one hand, this complex conflict situation, and, on the other, Islamist ideologues attempting to exploit it for their own ends. If we are to address this situation, we need sound knowledge of these countries’ history and ethnic make-up; only then will we be able to support the peace process and prevent Nigeria from disintegrating in a bloody war compared with which the carnage in the former Yugoslavia will seem trivial.</p>
<p class="contents">That, as has been said, is why our task is to get actively involved in the peace process, but to do so with precise knowledge of the realities of these countries, on which we can draw in our deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Nigeria is extremely delicate, but is not unique. It is repeated elsewhere, in Sudan, for example, although this has not been sufficiently publicised in view of public attention on Iraq, where events are all the more unforgivable since they are occurring with the complicity of armed forces from the European Union. I feel that what we are seeing is a fanatical <span class="italic">sharia</span> regime gradually taking hold, in particular in Southern Iraq, in Basra to be specific. This is a regime in which Christians are persecuted, alcohol is banned, western clothes are banned and veils must be worn, and all of this is happening with the complicity of the British troops on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue at the heart of the situation in Nigeria is Islamic fanaticism. This is more of an issue than the existence in the country of people of various ethnic backgrounds and beliefs, which is the case in most corners of the globe and is the result of the way in which history has unfolded. This problem must be combated, and we must not continue to play it down for the sake of short-term commercial interest or our oil-based diplomacy. This strikes me as the overriding message that we must convey to the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission shares the concern at conflicts between communities in Nigeria and condemns all attacks and violence, whether apparently ethnic, religious or social, etc. in origin.</p>
<p class="contents">We caution against a simplistic analysis of the situation which focuses on just one area or religious group. The violence is often related to conflicts over access to resources or triggered by political tensions. In the case of Plateau State, the causes of violence are related to both these reasons and the perpetrators have come from both sides of the community. It is factually wrong to describe this as something driven only by Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">For information, I would add that Plateau State is not a state which applies Sharia law, and it is not likely to because it has an overwhelming Christian majority composed of groups of indigenous people and settlers. In very many<span class="italic"> </span>cases, there is a sort of social clash between incomer settler groups and the original inhabitants – a version of a conflict that we see in very many<span class="italic"> </span>other places. The problem with understanding Nigeria is that there are several layers of problems, and each layer is normally enough to create a conflict. Therefore this complex situation is something we really have to respect in order to do something useful.</p>
<p class="contents">For the second time this afternoon I have to say that I agree with Mr Posselt's contribution. We have similar views on this situation. His reference to Yugoslavia is also very important because there we have assisted in a so-called solution which is contrary to what we, for very good reasons, find necessary for Africa, namely to avoid changing the geography. Even though we gave them nonsensical borders, Europe and others rightly agree with Africa itself that, as long as Africa does not want to change the borders, we definitely should not advise it to do that, even if it is difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Conflicts between communities in Nigeria have been evident for some time and we have been following the situation as part of the early warning system for conflict which the Commission is setting up. The Commission has also adapted its cooperation programme to reflect that situation. Support for human rights in Nigeria is a significant component of our cooperation strategy for the country. Nigeria was also selected as a focal country for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to respond to precisely the sort of concerns raised by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Three projects were approved last year, including one with a Nigerian NGO working in Plateau State and Kaduna State to promote peace between Muslims and Christians. The project also covers improving the drafting and application of Sharia law in conformity with the guarantees of religious freedom provided in the Nigerian constitution as well as respect for the international conventions providing protection for human rights which the country has signed.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, reasonable co-existence between Sharia law and the constitution of Nigeria is an option. This is what the country is trying to organise. I mention this simply by way of a warning that we must not move blindly in one direction without really reflecting on the complexities involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, other conflicts relating to religious differences are very important and we should be careful not to overlook or marginalise these other aspects. If we fail to understand this, we will not be of much use in a dialogue aimed at stopping the conflicts. Social, economic and ethnic problems – all these other layers of problems I have mentioned – have to be given a proper place in the analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">At federal level the Commission is working with Member States to strengthen political dialogue with Nigeria. This dialogue is one of the instruments provided by the Cotonou Agreement and the Federal Government is participating actively in that dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adapted to the special realities of Nigeria, where the states play a powerful role, and in fact the bulk of our work relating to water and sanitation is being done in six of the 36 states that make up the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We have chosen the six states not on the basis of where it is easiest to work, but where need is greatest. Although, in so doing, we are inviting problems, this is the most meaningful way of working on matters that relate to the core of the problems underlying what we are discussing here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">We share this House's call for the Federal Government to do everything in its power to protect its citizens, put an end to violence and promote respect of human rights, including of course freedom of religion. We hope that Parliament's adoption of a resolution which is balanced on this issue will be seen as meaningful encouragement along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
