<p class="contents">This is a very important moment in terms of European politics. After the launch of the euro, in a difficult economic climate, there is still the need to complete the economic and social reforms and sustainable development as targeted at Lisbon and Stockholm; the need to use the time this year to create the basis for an enlarged Union; the need to launch the Convention to make a Europe fit for the future. So I am sure this is a very full and ambitious programme. It gives me great pleasure to give the floor to Mr Aznar, President-in-Office of the Council.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Aznar,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, distinguished members of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to appear here for the first time as Spanish Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Council to explain to you the priorities of the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency coincides with the change of President of this Parliament. Yesterday, we attended the election of a new President in this House and the farewell to a President who has carried out her work very effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cox’s personality and political and institutional career guarantee that this House and the Presidency will enjoy fruitful political and institutional relations, which will be aimed at strengthening the European Union and creating a more prominent role for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has made a considerable contribution to today’s European Union through its work and its proposals, which represent a constant and innovative quest for greater efficiency in the functioning of the European Union. This House has also been able to adapt its diverse European parliamentary traditions, and try out new formulas in relations between civil society and its political representatives, increasing democratic control and the legitimacy of the European project. Nothing embodies this idea better than the codecision procedure which nevertheless needs to be improved for the sake of transparency and efficiency. The Spanish Presidency will therefore work to ensure that the eight conciliations scheduled for this six-month period are completed quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain wishes to increase the Union’s institutional cooperation and democratic control; I would therefore like to guarantee the Presidency’s presence in plenary sessions, as has become customary during the previous Presidency. For my part, I am committed to informing the House following the Barcelona European Council, and carrying out a final assessment of this Presidency after the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the current political landscape obliges the Union to be ambitious in three areas. The first consists of producing a response to terrorism, from the point of view of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. The second involves creating an area of greater economic prosperity which safeguards the European social model. And the third is to make a success of the historic opportunity of enlargement and laying the foundations for the future enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to successfully reach these goals, we need to work for a greater deepening of Europe. By creating ‘more Europe’ we will strengthen the fight against terrorism and ensure that the introduction of the euro is successful and, only if we are ambitious, we will achieve enlargement, we will make progress with the creation of an area of greater prosperity, we will strengthen the Union’s external role and we will carry out the next Intergovernmental Conference successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to acknowledge, and express my gratitude for, the responsibility that this House and the European Commission have demonstrated in the fight against terrorism. Days before the tragic events of 11 September, Parliament adopted a resolution which urged the European Commission to present various initiatives aimed at greater effectiveness in the fight against terrorism in the European Union. We must continue to work in the direction which you and the European Commission indicated at that time. Accordingly, on the basis of the rule of law, we need to press ahead with the Plan of Action against terrorism in the European Union to ensure that there can be no sanctuary for terror within our borders. In December 2001 we achieved great progress in this area. All the Institutions of the Union, and especially the Presidency and Parliament, now need to work to ensure that the instruments approved on that occasion come into effect as quickly as possible. However, those instruments will not prove effective unless we also achieve closer cooperation between the institutions and the security forces of the EU Member States. The Presidency therefore considers it a priority that joint investigation teams be set up rapidly, that Europol’s work be made more effective and that action be taken to prevent the funding of terrorists and of those who shelter or support them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As you well know, terrorist organisations establish cooperative links amongst themselves so that they can operate in a manner which exceeds the limits set by our borders. Spain wants the Union to play a more active role in the international sphere in the fight against terrorism. A first step towards this will be to develop close cooperation on criminal and legal matters with the United States, in accordance with the principles which underpin the legal system of the European Union, as emphasised by this House. The fight against terrorism needs to be waged within the context of the area of freedom, security and justice. The Presidency therefore attaches priority to pressing ahead to formulate a common policy on asylum and immigration, improve the management of the Union’s external frontiers, intensify our action against drugs trafficking and establish mutual recognition of court rulings both in civil matters, through the European enforcement order, and in the criminal field. These initiatives will require close institutional cooperation if we are to meet the deadlines set for creating the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the euro has been introduced, if I may say so, brilliantly, to say the least. By the end of the month few people in the Eurozone will still be using the old national currencies. This is good proof that Union policies are accepted when they are implemented properly and effectively. The solidity of our currency also calls for closer coordination of economic policies. This will mean enhancing the role of the Eurogroup, tightening the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and ensuring strict compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. The euro will also raise the profile of the Eurozone, and this will force the Presidency to ensure that the Union’s views are taken into account in international forums.</p>
<p class="contents">We should recall that over the last decade Europe has fallen back six points in its per capita income compared with the United States of America. We therefore need to press ahead with modernising our economies in order to achieve stronger growth. Accordingly, another focus of the Presidency’s work will be the creation of an area of greater economic and social prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is Spain’s intention that the Barcelona European Council should examine five specific areas with a view to achieving ‘More Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we will promote the connection and opening up of European transport and communications systems. The Presidency will concentrate on the review of the trans-European transport networks, on making the Single European Sky a reality and on pressing ahead with the liberalisation of rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area of work in Barcelona will be to design a European energy market based on opening-up, liberalisation, competition, transparency and interconnection. With these criteria in mind, the Presidency will examine the opening-up of the gas and electricity markets for companies and for consumers, the rules on third-party access to networks and the creation of infrastructure and interconnections between national energy markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The integration of the financial markets is an absolute precondition for the proper functioning of the single currency and a basic prerequisite for European growth. Spain will work to meet the deadlines of the Financial Services Action Plan and to see that the new approach based on the Lamfalussy report, which includes the necessary respect for institutional balance, is applied as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that employment is the best way of achieving social integration. As a fourth focus therefore, and on the basis of the Luxembourg Process in its current framework, the Barcelona European Council will seek a greater emphasis on the Employment Strategy in the analysis of the structural inflexibilities of our labour markets, in our tax and social protection systems and in the institutions of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">To get a good job, you undoubtedly first need access to a sound education which facilitates student mobility. Accordingly, the fifth point at Barcelona will be the Work Programme on education systems for the year 2010. We need to step up the quality of Europe’s education systems and open them up further to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in Barcelona, the candidate countries will take part in a working session of the European Council for the first time. In my opinion, integrating the candidates into our work on economic and social modernisation will be the best political signal of our support for the enlargement process upon which the Union has embarked.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that enlargement will turn the page on a bitter episode in our continent’s past. It will bring in countries that belong to the European family, countries which share our values and which have been treated badly by the vicissitudes of history. The Spanish Presidency’s political will is to help ensure that all those countries that are ready can conclude their negotiations by the end of this year, 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the current <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and the Financial Perspective, we will, during the Spanish Presidency, be negotiating the chapters relating to agriculture, regional policy and social cohesion policy, financial and budgetary provisions and institutional issues. Spain will also be seeking the closure of all those chapters that have not yet been concluded. For the negotiations to be rounded off definitively, all the Members of the Union will need to demonstrate their ability to compromise, the Commission will need to present its proposals on time and, above all, an effort will be required from each of the candidate countries. Progress will be assessed at the Seville European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we also know, and it is our wish, that the European Union is destined to fulfil an important and growing political function on the international stage. The success of European integration and Europe’s economic and commercial weight are forcing an ever greater and more important external political profile on the Union. The current international context requires us to step up the Union’s presence in areas where peace and security are directly threatened. The Spanish Presidency therefore hopes to help develop an ambitious comprehensive regional strategy in Central Asia and Afghanistan to prevent the emergence of new areas of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">But there will be no point in providing a European presence if we lack the capacity for effective crisis management and, specifically, military forces for limited operations requiring a rapid response. This objective should be achieved in the near future, when the European Security and Defence Policy effectively comes into operation and when the definitive pattern is established for a relationship of consultation and cooperation with the Atlantic Alliance. In this same area, Spain also proposes to launch a discussion on making the fight against terrorism an objective of the European Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the Union’s foreign policy will rest not only on its international presence, but also on effective instruments for implementing that policy and, above all, on a high degree of mutual consultation. On this last point, Spain attaches priority to developing the European Union’s relations with North America and with Russia. With North America we need to reinforce the trans-Atlantic dialogue, giving it greater and renewed strategic content. With Russia, Spain believes the European Union needs to support the strategy that country is currently implementing. Accordingly, one of the Presidency’s objectives will be to consolidate EU relations with Russia, relations based on specific points and tangible progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, next May in Madrid, the European Union will be holding its Second Summit with Latin America and the Caribbean with a view to renewing and promoting the strategic association between the two geographical regions. One objective of the Summit will be to work with Chile in order to make progress on the Association and Free Trade Agreement and push forward the Union’s negotiations with Mercosur. In addition, the European Union will be holding specific meetings with the Andean Community and Central America. At this point, I am bound to refer to our interest in and concern regarding the developing situation in Argentina. The European Union will work with the Argentine authorities to find realistic solutions based on dialogue, solutions which will restore confidence and enable the Argentine economy to achieve new growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will also play an important role in achieving stability in the Middle East. For this we will need to step up our coordination with the United States and the other sponsors of the Peace Process. I hope that the recent European Union Declaration and the contacts established in the last few days on the initiative of the Spanish Presidency will help resolve a situation of instability which is affecting the countries of the region and the Mediterranean in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East conflict is a major factor influencing the progress of the Barcelona Process, the only forum for dialogue which brings together all those involved in the Peace Process, who are due to meet at the forthcoming Ministerial Summit in Valencia. Spain will also push for the conclusion of the outstanding Association Agreements between the European Union and the countries bordering the Mediterranean, and will work for the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean internal market and the development of the regional strategies on infrastructure. To help achieve this objective, the Laeken European Council, acting on a Spanish initiative, took up the idea of creating a bank specialising in operations in the Mediterranean countries, an idea we will be working on over the next few months in collaboration with the European Investment Bank and the monetary authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that it is only by encouraging balanced development that we will be able to tackle illegal immigration effectively. Aware of the enormous importance of this phenomenon, Spain, with the backing of China and Vietnam, has been working for some time to ensure the success of the ministerial meeting on immigration to be held between the European Union and the Asian members of ASEM. We know that illegal immigration is the result of poverty and underdevelopment. This is why the Spanish Presidency attaches particular importance to the Monterrey Summit on Financing Development, which we are preparing in close cooperation with the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is safe to say that few people could have imagined that 45 years after the signing of the Treaties of Rome, 300 million Europeans would be using the same currency. We need to pursue this successful course, in what is a key period for the Union. This will require greater involvement of the people of Europe in shaping the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken European Council decided to set up a Convention on the future of Europe. That Convention will be holding its first session on 28 February in the European Parliament in Brussels. What place could better reflect both the importance of the new phase the European Union is going through and the recognition the Presidency wishes to give to the European Parliament’s work on the future of Europe. The Spanish Presidency is firmly set on contributing to the success of the Convention. That success will be the key to consolidating the process of gradual constitutionalisation of the Treaties we are currently engaged in, and to ensuring that such Conventions are in future perceived as a good method of preparing intergovernmental conferences. I hope that the President of the Convention will be able, as agreed, to present an initial report on the Convention’s work to the Seville European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I came here today to set out the priorities of the Spanish Presidency. Those priorities should translate into greater de facto solidarity, a solidarity which will enable us, on the basis of balance and of mutual respect for diverse interests, to continue consolidating the greatest period of peace, prosperity and freedom Europe has ever known. We know this will be a complex and arduous task, on account both of the number of issues we will need to apply ourselves to and of the ambitious nature of our goals. But it is only by virtue of that ambition, and on the basis of close collaboration between the institutions, that we will be able, as I am sure we will, to make this project a reality, a project whose ultimate purpose is to improve the lives of all the people of Europe.</p>

In the twelve Euro-zone countries, 90% of payments are now being made in the single currency: the changeover to the euro has been both a huge task and a huge success. We can all feel proud of that success because we have all contributed to it: the European Parliament and national parliaments, governments, the European Central Bank and the Member States’ central banks, the Commission, commercial banks, post offices, retailers, businesses, the media and every one of our citizens who have helped to bring about this historic changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">For millions of European citizens, the euro notes and coins in their pockets are a tangible sign of the great political project of building a united Europe. As a symbol of that unity, the euro is having an even greater psychological impact than the abolition of passport controls at Europe’s internal borders. The euro is thus becoming a key element in people’s sense of a shared European identity and a common destiny, just as it is tangible evidence that European integration is now irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">The changeover to the euro shows that the Europeans are willing to embrace change enthusiastically and resolutely if that change is for the sake of a better future, and if all the issues involved are discussed thoroughly and openly. The changeover to the euro shows the scale of what Europe can achieve when it can muster the necessary political will. We must take this as a valuable lesson and apply it in the preparations for all the stages in the process of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Prime Minister, Spain has chosen the motto “More Europe” for its six-month presidency of the Union. I think we can say, just after the launch of the euro, that Spain could not have chosen better.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, your government has also devised a broad but balanced and ambitious programme, and I am very pleased to see that the priorities it sets out match the priorities that the Commission has set itself for 2002. I can therefore assure you that you can count on the Commission’s full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the same ambition that has led to the success of the launch of the new European currency must now be shown and exploited again to accomplish the Union’s Economic and Social Agenda. We have achieved monetary union. The time has now come to focus on economic union, and to make it a tangible reality. We need the economic growth that will generate jobs and a better quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost two years have passed since the European Council in Lisbon set the goal of making the Union the world’s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economic area by the end of this decade, an area which would also enjoy full employment and increased economic and social cohesion. Since that time, the Spring Councils have provided the opportunity to discuss economic, social and environmental issues as part of a wide-ranging strategy for sustainable development. The Barcelona Council will, therefore, be called upon to assess the progress we have made so far and to set priorities for the coming years. In preparation for the Council, yesterday, the Commission adopted its Spring Report, which will provide the basis for the Council’s work and which, this year, bears the title ‘The Lisbon strategy — making change happen’.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday’s Commission communication has a central message: the time has come to stick to our commitments and to speed up reform. We have no choice: the strategy adopted at Lisbon is the key to developing and consolidating our European economic and social model. Indeed, we are reforming a society that already has its own shared values, values that distinguish Europe from the rest of the world and on which the European Union is founded. It is precisely these values that we have in mind when we speak of the ‘European social model’.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, we have to continue to update the kind of model of society we want and can achieve in Europe: the kind of free, fair, democratic society that our fellow-citizens hold so dear. This is not about devaluing or getting rid of our social heritage: it is about adapting it and modernising it so as to ensure that it lasts. We have a duty to history, a duty to protect future generations and a duty to respond to globalisation, and all the more so at this time of great uncertainty and risk when genuine, practical solidarity – not just superficial, partial solidarity – has become very important for our citizens, especially the weakest among them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report looks at the progress made so far in implementing the Lisbon strategy and concludes that all the prerequisites for success are there. On the macroeconomic front, the efforts made over the last ten years towards introducing the euro have enabled the Union to achieve economic stability and have protected it from the worst of the international economic and financial crises. Even at this time of economic slowdown, the bases of Europe’s economy have remained sound.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging progress has also been made in implementing the strategy adopted at Lisbon. Significant results have been achieved in a number of areas such as the environment, telecommunications, education, pension reform and research, but progress has not been as good in other areas, with Commission proposals stalled and the deadlines set by the European Council itself in jeopardy. Among these areas are some that are essential to the integration of financial, transport and energy services, the Community patent and the Galileo project. I am pleased to see, Mr President, that you have made these areas a priority for your action in the coming months. We need to catch up, and catch up fast. Our credibility and, more importantly, our chances of making real progress depend on it. If there is no change, we will end up with less growth and less jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report sets three priorities for 2002: employment, reform and knowledge. First, employment.<span class="bold"> </span>Europe needs an active employment policy. More needs to be done to remove the obstacles that still prevent people from finding employment or which make it difficult for them to keep their jobs. Member States must cut the cost of labour by reducing taxation that affects wages and salaries – especially low wages. They must also review those aspects of their unemployment benefit systems that dissuade people from returning to the labour market and they must make it less easy for them to take early retirement. We need better childcare, in order to improve women’s presence in the workforce. We need incentives for those who decide to stay in work longer. Employment rates can also be maintained by improving skills, education and individuals’ mobility within Europe and between production sectors. In other words, we need an active, not a passive approach to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, reform, and completing the internal market.<span class="bold"> </span>We need to connect Europe and its markets. Much greater effort must be made to achieve an interconnection of national markets and to speed up the integration of financial markets, concluding the reforms already underway. We need to open up and connect the energy and transport markets and develop Europe’s broadband networks. These industries are the backbone of our economy. We need greater competition to bring prices down and stimulate growth while maintaining a sufficient standard of basic services for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, education, training and research.<span class="bold"> </span>Education, training and research really are the keys to economic renewal, sustainable growth and job creation. There can be no ‘knowledge-based society’ without knowledge. Therefore, we need to invest much more heavily in these areas. We need an integrated strategy for Community-level education and research, based on networking and mobility and giving priority to the technologies of the future, to biotechnology and clean technologies, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our report states the need, after Barcelona, to introduce measures to strengthen coordination of our overall economic strategy. This means building a consensus on principles and rules of economic policy that take account of economic interdependence within the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we need to synchronise the three current processes – the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines and the process of economic reform launched at Cardiff – so that, each year, the Spring Council can review economic and social policy as a whole and make sure it is sustainable. Only a more coherent approach will enable us to make full, effective use of the various instruments at our disposal. It is time to give up the old, sectorally-fragmented methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, the President of the Commission has to play a sometimes rather uncomfortable role at European Councils – that of being the one who reminds those he is working with of the need to honour undertakings made collectively. However, I remain confident that you will support me at Barcelona when I urge the Member States to push ahead resolutely with the agenda of reforms agreed at Lisbon, in line with the report’s recommendations. We are responsible for making sure that the Barcelona Council achieves total success. If the process grinds to a halt, the cost of ‘non-reform’ would become unbearable both in economic terms and in terms of the Union’s political credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, 2002 will be a crucial year for the enlargement process, and we know that – as we have heard – the Spanish Presidency will be making every effort to keep up the momentum, so that we can conclude negotiations this year with those countries that have shown that they meet the criteria for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Vital though it is to the Union’s future, eastward enlargement is not the only external issue requiring the Union’s attention. Relations with the countries of the Mediterranean are, of necessity, a priority for the Union in its external activities. I look forward to seeing Euro-Mediterranean dialogue move decisively forwards under the Spanish Presidency – after all, it was in Barcelona that the dialogue was launched. To this end, we must adopt a more flexible approach, setting up, together with some groups of countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, new forms of sub-regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to put into practice the idea, formed jointly by the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, of a 'Mediterranean Development Bank’. Irrespective of whether it is an independent bank or part of the European Investment Bank, it is to be a forum dedicated to development, in which European and Southern Mediterranean operators work side by side.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is vital to promote mutual understanding and knowledge between peoples and cultures, through specific actions on various fronts. Indeed, I feel that it is precisely by exporting our experience of peacemaking and our commitment to promoting democracy that we will be able to take “More Europe” to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, you have pointed out that Latin America, though very distant from us geographically, is very close to Europe’s culture and origins, having shared a long period of history with many European countries. This is a time when the Union must show particularly strong solidarity with Argentina and all of Mercosur, as they experience serious crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Argentina needs to return to the path of economic growth, the only way for it to improve its present difficult social situation. There is only one recipe for achieving this goal: restoring confidence. Confidence in political institutions, confidence in the stability of the rule of law and confidence in a credible, coherent economic programme. Our experience of financial reform and economic development driven by trade and integration could be of valuable help to Latin America as it endeavours to recover, with advantages for all involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to finish by saying a few words on the Convention that will be beginning its work under the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention’s great significance will give it the chance to write an exciting chapter in Europe’s history. We all have a duty to do all we can to ensure that this does indeed happen. I have already assured its Chairman, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, that he will have the full support of the Commission and the Commission’s representatives to the Convention. The Commission expects to work just as closely with the European Parliament, as the legitimate representative of the hopes of the people of Europe. We must ensure that the debate is full and fruitful and, most importantly, that it delivers a vision for the future with which the majority of our citizens can identify. The Convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference must complete the construction of an open, accountable, democratic and fair Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have arrived in Parliament at a time when we are engaged in organising our work for the second half of this term. Our attainment of the great objectives of which you have spoken is dependent on technical on behalf of Europe. Our group warmly welcomes you to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">You have yourself observed that you are here for the first time. We emphatically welcome the fact that you will be here in Parliament on three occasions as President-in-Office of the Council and as Prime Minister of Spain to give an account of the decisions reached under your Presidency. We are grateful to you for that, and we hope that all following Presidencies will learn from your example. We also, though, expect greater transparency in the Council of Ministers and ask of you that the report the Council is now drafting should also lead to real results, making an important step forward towards greater transparency in the Council of Ministers possible under your Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">You have spoken, too, about terrorism, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with you. There is no such thing as good and bad terrorism. There is only terrorism, and we must say loud and clear that wherever people are deliberately being killed, whether by ETA in Spain, whether on 11 September, whether in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world, it must be countered by decisive protest from us, and we must combat terrorism with the utmost determination and make democracy and the rule of law the foundation of relations between peoples and people.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcomed your reference to Russia, Mr President-in-Office. Whilst needing good relations with Russia, we are aware that there are at present the gravest abuses of human rights taking place in Chechnya. As Christian and European democrats, we declare that the life of a peaceful Muslim in Chechnya or anywhere else in the world is of the same value as the life of a Christian or a non-Christian in the West. We must defend human dignity throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You have also spoken about the euro, and we support what you have said. Let us, in this hour of joy over the euro, which the President of the Commission has described as a gigantic project, let us remember – for the euro has many parents, indeed only too many fathers – that it was people such as Helmut Kohl, the Honorary Citizen of Europe, François Mitterrand and Jacques Delors, who, with the support of others, advanced this great project in those days. I would like also to invoke the name of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the chairman of the Convention, who, with Helmut Schmidt and others in the Seventies, prepared the way for the European Monetary System. I congratulate you on your choice of him.</p>
<p class="contents">What now matters is that we pursue a policy of stability, for things are changing. I recall how friends in my party looked at Italy before the introduction of the euro, doubted whether Italy should join the common currency and wondered whether policies of stability were really pursued there. I do not want to single out any one country, but all of what we hear today from Italy indicates that the countries in which Italy was formerly criticised could rightly have the same criticism levelled at them today, as they have not been doing what is needed for the stability of the European currency. So let there be restructuring of the budget!</p>
<p class="contents">We must consolidate Europe as an economic base, which means that it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that we must promote by means of a sensible and moderate fiscal policy, something we strongly support. In order that we might go in the same direction, we need coordination in economic policy and in stability policy – coordination rather than harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I very much welcome what you had to say about the Convention. We will quite happily offer the use of our group's meeting room – another great group has met there before, so they may well agree to the offer – but the spirit of our meeting room is today particularly well suited to working on the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">I have something to ask of you, Mr President-in-Office. It is with great joy that we have heard that our colleague, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg and one-time President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, has been appointed by the government of Luxembourg, that is, by Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, as Luxembourg's representative to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We ask you most sincerely to exert your influence as President-in-Office of the Council so that all governments send personalities to this Convention whose words carry weight in the national capitals and governments, so that what is decided in the Convention may also have something of a cohesive effect on the national governments in the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to a final aspect, namely enlargement and the Mediterranean dialogue. We are right alongside you as far as the timing for 2002 and the conclusion of the first accession treaties is concerned. Our Group has decided that observers should be sent as soon as possible to the European Parliament from the countries with which the treaties are to be signed – observers who would pass on information to these countries until the European elections, when representatives from these countries will sit as equals in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly support you in the Mediterranean dialogue. We must ensure that people in the countries along the Mediterranean that do not belong to the European Union have a chance and prospects in their own country – in Morocco, in Algeria, everywhere, even in the Arab countries – and do not all come to us. We must help them in this, and I very much welcome the initiatives of the Spanish Presidency. We wish you every success on your way. There will always be a warm welcome for you from us in Parliament. If you meet with success, then it is a success for us all, for the Council Presidency, for Parliament, for the Commission and for the European Union that we share. Great success for you personally, but also for your presidency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Spanish Presidency for appearing here so quickly, in accordance with what has now become the custom, and I would point out that we have passed the mid-point of the legislature with a clear conservative shift in the Council, which, Mr President, is confirmed by your position as President of the CDI – the Centre Democratic International for you and the Christian Democratic International for Mr Poettering; in any event, conservative.</p>
<p class="contents">Your presidency’s programme follows the normal tendency for the Council’s six-month approach of aiming for as many successes as possible. But, of course, it is not sufficient to reap the harvest, but we must also sow seeds and tend the crop. Mr President, please allow me to analyse the six objectives of the Spanish Presidency, which you have summed up in three categories, in the light of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall mention firstly the area of freedom, justice and security, with the fight against terrorism as a priority. You have rightly acknowledged that the European Parliament acted as a pioneer by stating that there was a need for a Community anti-terrorist policy. It did so before 11 September. We worked very hard on the Commission’s proposals and would have this policy by now were it not for the inefficiency of the Council, which sent us the consultations in December. My political family is entirely in favour of this objective. It is your family which has the problems, but we intend to help you.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will mention the euro. We owe the success of the euro above all to our fellow citizens. We must acknowledge this, because we also criticise the fact that we are distant from the citizens, but on this occasion, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January, they have moved ahead of us. For once we can say that it has also been a success for the Commission, which has been responsible for the operation, for President Prodi, who, when he was President of Ecofin, made it possible for Italy to join the euro together with the current President of the Republic, while the current government of that country partly chose, on I January, to denigrate the single currency. It has also been a success for Commissioner Pedro Solbes, who was the Spanish Minister for the Economy in December 1995.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Because, ladies and gentlemen, both the euro and Economic and Monetary Union were born in Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I imagine that all this commotion will not be counted as part of my speaking time.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that this Spanish Presidency can match up to previous presidencies. The euro is also a success for the European Central Bank, for the financial institutions, for the hundreds of thousands of anonymous citizens who went to work on 1 January, and we must recognise that it has also been a success for Pierre Werner, for Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, for Helmut Schmidt, for François Mitterrand, for Helmut Kohl, for Ruud Lubbers, for Giulio Andreotti, for John Major, for Felipe González and also for Jacques Santer, as President of the Commission. I think it is right to acknowledge this.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge now is to create an Economic Union which matches Monetary Union – as the President of the Commission pointed out – and also develop the Lisbon strategy, which in our opinion means sustainable development, more social cohesion, more full employment, more competitiveness. In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would draw your attention to the European Parliament’s resolution on services of general interest, which is very explicit. It is not sufficient to privatise services without liberalising, because that simply means replacing public monopolies with private ones. There must be rules to protect citizens and consumers. Look what has happened with Enron and what your government had to do about the Christmas power cuts, when it asked for the illuminations to be postponed by two hours.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, it falls to you to make progress on something which you not going to be able harvest, but you have to do it and I welcome the fact that you are taking this on responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Union’s international action, I believe that, as well as the need to persevere in the Middle East and relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean process, Latin America, and Argentina in particular, should currently be the focus of attention. We share your concern. We believe that we should respond in a decisive fashion, led by the Commission. We Europeans have historical debts and links with Argentina, with those people who fled hunger or oppression. We must tell the Argentinians that they must believe in their country, in their values and that we will be able to help them. I would ask the Commission to put forward a practical proposal in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I will comment on the debate on the Convention and governance. We welcome the historic milestone represented by the establishment of the Convention. We have been fighting for it for many years. The European Council has accepted the idea of doubling the European and national parliamentary presence. Your presence has been increased more, with the troika and the presidential triumvirate, but we have gained in a relative sense. You are perfect hosts. You have not said what you think about ‘more Europe’. Is it a cause for amendment? In any event, Mr President, I believe that the great majority of this House is in favour of constitutionalising the process, of creating a Federation of States and Citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we do not see the Convention as a battle between parties and in this regard I must point out that Mr Berlusconi said in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> on 12 January that we are in favour of centralising everything. Centralising what? The media? In this respect we really are willing to jointly defend our project.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word on governance and codecision. You applaud the Mandelkern report, but we are not familiar with it and that concerns us very much. We have yet to debate the Lamfalussy procedure. We do not support the report of a distinguished official of the Council whom we do not know and which may go against the principle of codecision. You must speak to us and sow and tend the crop, as well as harvesting it.</p>

Prime Minister, you have chosen More Europe as the theme for your presidency. Liberal Democrats hope that this will be reflected in your commitment to enlargement of the European Union. Just as this House insisted on Iberian enlargement some 15 years ago, despite doubts in certain national capitals, so we will militate for an early and successful eastward enlargement in which 2002 will be crucial. We will judge your presidency primarily by your achievements in preparing the reunification of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish you success, too, in your efforts to guide smoothly the introduction of the euro. As one who saw in the New Year in France, I am particularly grateful for Spain's role in lending Chirac and Jospin a little small change. Perhaps next time you see Tony Blair you will hand him a few coins as well and ask him whether his indecision is final. British entry into the euro would certainly mean the kind of More Europe we would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Your vision of the future speaks of new transnational challenges. Relations between India and Pakistan are deeply worrying but Afghanistan must be uppermost in our minds. Soon the bombing must stop and the building must begin. We must respond to the plight of the people through generous giving from our aid budget and more help in patrolling the peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Your programme speaks of a war against terrorism. This is no conventional war and it will not be won with conventional weapons. Some of us fear that military intelligence, which is leading to bombing and military solutions, may be causing collateral damage and storing up other problems for the future. We hope that Europe can offset this collateral damage by adding to our armoury emotional intelligence, recognising that political problems often require political solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">You kindly referred to my report on terrorism, adopted on 6 September last year. I would draw your attention, too, to our resolution on cooperation between the United States and the European Union in the fight against terrorism. Liberal Democrats view with deep unease the divergence between the US approach of emergency laws and military tribunals and the rights-based approach that we want for the Union. We insist that you can be both tough on terrorism and true to our Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You will take forward the building of the area of freedom, security and justice defined in the Amsterdam Treaty. Your presidency programme asserts that current exceptional circumstances require putting security first. If this is true we will nonetheless push you to make sure that freedom and justice are not far behind.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting a programme like this any presidency faces a dilemma. We recognise that. A list of priorities soon becomes a universal catalogue. Each Member State brings something different to the party. While we welcome the input that Spain can make to the Barcelona Process and Euro-Med, we are nonetheless fascinated to read in your programme that the European Union's northern dimension is one of your priorities. We will follow development in this matter closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the Council that you talk about is most welcome. We hope that you will ensure that the Council abides by its undertaking to allow public access to documents and that it seeks better relations with this House, which, sadly, does not get a mention in your programme until page 20. This House is the true democratic forum of our continent and we want to see its rights respected.</p>
<p class="contents">If for my Group something is missing in this document it is a recognition of Europe's different regions and cultures. It reads to me as a rather Castilian programme that does not reflect entirely the Spain which I have visited and the Spain that is represented in my Group. What has become of the work of the eminent Director-General in the Commission, Mr Eneko Landaburu? Your second definition of More Europe talks about 'signifying the European nature of Spanish society.' Our second definition of More Europe would be that it signifies the contribution of all Iberian cultures and the flowering thereof among other European cultures in the creation of a Europe whose strength is not that of a monolithic state with deciduous development, but one of unity through diversity. In wishing you every success, Prime Minister, I look forward to a vigorous debate with the Spanish Presidency.</p>

<p class="contents">In a constructive spirit, I would just like, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to express certain doubts and criticisms that we have concerning the focus of the programme you have just presented.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> The Spanish Presidency has decided to focus very strongly on combating terrorism. This is certainly a legitimate reflection of Spain’s national policy of eliminating ETA violence once and for all. However, it would appear important to emphasise that it is neither acceptable nor effective to imagine that terrorist violence can be curbed by reducing the significance of some of the most important victories of the European democracies and the Union such as respect for individual freedoms, citizens’ equality before the law and parliamentary control at European as well as national level of all decisions on this matter. We would certainly have been much happier if you had shown your intention to uphold these concepts more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is a matter of no small concern that the Spanish government is concentrating on cooperation with the United States without, at the same time, distancing the Union from those decisions of the US administration which place it outside the rule of law and which could lead to a militarisation of the legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, talking about an international anti-terrorism alliance but remaining silent on the way the Russian government is continuing to terrorise and destroy Chechnya does nothing for the European Union’s credibility.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr President-in-Office, your government’s programme includes a list of themes, but it does not clearly define the political vision for European integration. Further evidence of this is the fact that the only task you are entrusting to the Convention, which will start work in two months’ time, is the preparation of tangible, realistic options to submit to the 2004 Conference. Yet, as you are quite aware, this Convention is the product of the failure of Nice, and its success will be measured in terms of its ability to constitute a break with the intergovernmental method of reforming the Union and to involve representatives of the people and civil society in the process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my fervent hope that the Spanish Presidency will support this innovative experiment and accept calmly that we have reached the stage where it is no longer just the States but the citizens and their representatives at European, national and regional levels as well – at regional level too – who can and must be involved in shaping the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of shared values, I would like to ask you not to underestimate the European dimension of what has been happening in my native country, Italy, where the principle of the separation of powers is constantly being challenged and where there is still a problem with the concentration of media power combined with an unresolved conflict of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are greatly concerned at the cursory treatment in your programme of the issue of sustainable development and the urgent need to respond with practical, incisive action to the environmental challenges facing us. It would appear that this cursory treatment is a direct result of an antiquated idea that the priorities of economic growth and safeguarding the environment and quality of life are still conflicting. In fact, the opposite is true. However, and I cannot stress this enough, the environmental constraints governing the economic, social and fiscal policies of the Union and its Member States continue to be inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would very briefly like to give you two negative examples, which directly concern Spain. The first is the national hydrological plan, against which there is strong opposition in your country, Mr Aznar: 400 000 people protesting in Madrid and 10 000 in Brussels, as well as 25 000 individual complaints to the Commission cannot be ignored, and we will make this matter a priority in our work. We do not accept the claim that the hydrological plan is purely a Spanish affair, not just because the Spanish government wants EUR 8 billion from the Structural Funds to be spent on financing part of it but because, if it were to be implemented, it would violate European legislation on nature conservation and the safeguarding of water resources and would lead to a distortion of competition in the agricultural sector. Also, finally, because the real purpose of the plan is to transfer water resources from poor regions to wealthy regions in order to serve water-intensive farming and tourism development. This is a recipe for disaster, which has already caused havoc that we cannot allow to be repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">I have other things to say to you, Mr President-in-Office, regarding the liberalisation of the electricity market, but I will save them for another time. In any case, I wish you a successful six month’s work.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has come at a time of international difficulty and it must therefore deal with highly topical issues. In order to deal with these issues, as you said, Mr Aznar, we will need ‘more Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro has created a new reality. The most important task, Mr Aznar, is to supplement the euro in the economic and social fields. You have expressed your intention to carry out what you call new economic reforms. In the language of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, this means promoting the social aspects of European integration in a decisive manner and strengthening economic and social cohesion. We believe that Europe is not going to improve its economic cohesion and development by means of policies of liberalisation and privatisation, by means of employment deregulation which endangers jobs and by reducing levels of social protection and by tax reforms which make fiscal systems less sufficient and less progressive.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr Aznar, the international economic situation demands imagination and flexibility. We believe that we should not confront it shackled by a rigorous and excessively restrictive notion of the stability pact. The fact that the world economy is now close to recession is beyond question, Mr Aznar. The European Union needs political impetus and democratisation of its economic decision-making. We need budgets geared towards employment and economic and social cohesion. The stability pact must be made more flexible and at least preserve public investment when there are excessive deficits, and this is an expenditure which is an essential element for the future development of the Union and also, in the short term, an element which will increase and stimulate economic activity. It is essential to supplement the single currency with a process of harmonisation in the fiscal, employment and social fields, building a genuine economic policy – not just monetary – and making decisive progress towards a social Europe. Lastly, Mr Aznar, it worries us that there is no attempt to strengthen public services, which would reflect a social view of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Many fashionable reforms in our countries put an end to public monopolies in strategic sectors, only to convert them in many cases into private oligopolies, which makes them difficult to control publicly and which does not lead to any real increase in efficiency. I could cite various examples in different countries concerning rail transport, health systems or electrical supplies. Therefore, Mr Aznar, in summary, we believe that the Barcelona Summit should reflect this type of concern and adopt a much more dynamic and stronger view of European social integration.</p>
<p class="contents">You will recognise, as I do, that, on this issue, I am obviously expressing the existing differences, as you know, between our different political forces. Of course, Mr Aznar, the negotiations on the bases of the enlargement agreement – as the Spanish Presidency has said, and I agree with it – must be concluded during this six-month period. Otherwise, enlargement will not be possible in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Mr Aznar, I would like to make the following comment: a Union of 27 States – with enlargement to a further 10 States – will increase the surface area of the European Union by 34%, it will increase the population by more than 28%, but the Community income will increase by barely 5%. Do we really appreciate the political challenge posed by enlargement? Do we really appreciate the degree to which social problems may be exacerbated as a result of enlargement? In the current European Union, 16% of the population have a per capita income which is 90% lower than the Community average, and in the Union of 27 States, for example, this proportion would rise to 34%.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that for the first time, unlike what happened with the so-called Delors packages, where in successive enlargements of the area of the internal market there were firm commitments in relation to decisive increases in economic and social cohesion, we are now in a situation in which economic and social cohesion – as was expressed in the Delors packages – must be thoroughly strengthened and increased. We would therefore like an unequivocal signal in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible that the agricultural negotiation will end with the implementation of a transitional period that will go beyond the deadline of 2006. The problem will be what to do next. Agriculture, like any economic activity, requires prospects and the negotiation should be accompanied by clear signals on the future of the agricultural policy, where we will surely hear requests from some people for the dismantling of common policies for the sake of budgetary savings. Others believe that the common policies should not be dismantled, but rather strengthened in certain areas, such as food safety and environmental concerns, which should be incorporated into all our Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the structural funds brings into focus – as I said in relation to the Delors packages – the future political shape of the European Union. A larger European Union will require greater efforts to increase economic and social cohesion between the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar, we must construct an area of freedom, justice and security for the citizens, while fully respecting the democratic traditions of our countries and the fundamental human rights embodied in our Charter. There is no place for terrorism in this area. Terrorism is our enemy, but neither should there be room for repressive laws or measures which bear no relation to this fight and which contribute to reducing the legal and judicial guarantees of our citizens. The construction of this area of freedom must also be an opportunity to achieve a very high degree of harmonisation of legal guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of foreign, security and defence policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am going to make a few very specific comments in order to be brief. The Spanish Presidency has the responsibility to ensure that the European Union and the European Parliament, in cooperation with the Spanish Presidency, take a decisive step in terms of seeking a just solution in the Middle East. We believe that we should make it very clear that the decisions of the United Nations and of international law should be respected and that Israel’s illegal and military occupation of the Palestinian State should cease.</p>
<p class="contents">We should welcome the intention to continue improving the Barcelona process, which is currently in stalemate. A genuine regional integration of the countries on the Southern shores of the Mediterranean is necessary. The development of the region cannot be based solely on the aid and commercial concessions provided by the European Union, established individually with each of the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">More Europe means playing our proper role in regional stabilisation and promoting the economic development of our neighbouring areas. Accordingly, the initiative of creating the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank seems to us to be a positive one. But, while perhaps complicating the issue, Mr Aznar, the Morocco-Sahara conflict must be resolved through the calling of the referendum on self-determination, as agreed in the United Nations. We believe that the position taken by the Spanish Government on this problem, in accordance with Spain’s responsibility towards the Saharan people and international law, is commendable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency should direct its greatest efforts towards Central America, particularly at this crucial time, with the acute crisis in Colombia and the collapse of the Argentine economy. The European Parliament unanimously supported the negotiated solution to the long conflict suffered by Colombia, disassociating itself from the militarisation of the United States’ proposal, the Colombia Plan. In these tragic times, the authoritative voice of the European Union may be decisive in terms of consolidating talks between the government and the guerrilla movement. We hope, Mr Aznar, that you will act accordingly. The Belgian Presidency has taken significant steps in normalising relations with Cuba, by beginning to overcome the so-called common position, which is more suited to the Cold War than to present times.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar, my political group has strongly supported the Convention. We would have liked the participation in it to be more pluralist, but in any event, we are convinced of its importance. The Spanish Presidency has said that the issues dealt with by the Convention must be very open and that its agreements and conclusions should inform the future decisions of the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar, you will note that I have described a landscape of positive and negative positions. You can count on the cooperation of the humble group I represent within my political group on all those positive issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, in setting out the presidency's programme with regard to key policy issues, which will be addressed over the next six months by the European Union, the Spanish Prime Minister has stated that his priority of priorities during Spain's six-months' presidency of the EU will be the global fight against terrorism. I strongly support this political objective. The European Union has certainly adopted a series of measures to combat international terrorism in recent months as an immediate response to the horrific terrorist attacks in the United States last September. The prevention of the use of the European financial system as a money-laundering route for terrorism must continue to be a priority for our Union. The fifteen governments of the Union should also be in a position to freeze the assets of terrorists and those involved in organised and international crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the Spanish Government's objective of promoting more police cooperation across the borders of the Union. This is very important because intelligence agencies within the Union, together with Europol, have to work much more closely together in terms of exchanging and sharing information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement negotiations with the applicant countries will be entering a new phase during the Spanish Presidency. This presidency is being entrusted with two very difficult chapters in the negotiations on enlargement, namely agricultural policy and regional aid. The Union and the applicant countries must sit down and hammer out an agreement on the difficult chapters of the discussions because otherwise enlargement of the Union cannot take place quickly and will not be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries in Eastern and Central Europe are presently receiving EU Structural Funds so as to make their economies more competitive. This is an important policy objective because it will ensure that on entry these countries can participate within the Union in a competitive climate. If the economies of Eastern and Central Europe are not competitive, then they will not be able to participate within the internal market in any real, effective sense. Equally, promoting market economies in Eastern and Central Europe is good news for businesses within the Union, which can also expand their goods and services into new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Government is also going to set up the Convention in March this year to look at the development of the future of EU policies within the Union in the context of the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. It is important that the terms of reference of this Convention are clear and decisive and that its conclusions in due course do not turn out to be an unattainable wish list. Amendments to the Treaties have to be agreed by European Union leaders and any proposals emanating from this Convention must be balanced, progressive and achievable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the commitment of the Spanish Government to promote the implementation of EU regulations and directives, which should expand the use of new information technologies into all parts of the Union. This is exceptionally important if the Union is to remain competitive in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of the great disappointments of Laeken was the failure to reach agreement on the siting of up to 12 new important EU agencies. I hope that the Spanish Government can reach agreement quickly on the location of these important agencies, in particular the European Food Authority and the European Maritime Safety Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will have a very unevenly balanced membership of 105 people and a 14-member praesidium which also looks as if it will be very unevenly balanced. I would call upon you to ensure that these 14 members also include representatives of the 49% who voted ‘no’ in the referendum on Maastricht in France and of the near enough 50% who voted ‘no’ in a couple of referendums in Denmark. I think it very inappropriate to put together a praesidium of 14 representatives who think alike and who will produce a result which, after three or four years, then ends up being overturned in a referendum. It would be more practical to secure a lasting compromise by entering into dialogue straight away with the different points of view to be found among the various populations.</p>
<p class="contents">The intergroup here in Parliament, which is called ‘SOS Democracy’ and whose members are in a way the federalists’ polar opposites, as well as partners cooperating on issues of transparency and proximity to the people, has had an excellent meeting with Mr Verhofstadt and also wishes to request a corresponding meeting with yourself. During the meeting with Mr Verhofstadt, the latter made two interesting pledges.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, he called for all the delegations from all the countries to include those we call Eurorealists and urged that, for example, at least one of the three representatives – two from the national parliament and one from the government – from two of the countries should be someone with a Eurorealist approach. He pledged that he would work towards these goals and called upon us to campaign for them. His second pledge was that he would support a subsequent referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to Mr Aznar is as to whether he too would call for broad representation and ensure that referendums subsequently take place. Will he be involved in ensuring that two different drafts are prepared: a constitution for a democratic federal state, and a democratic agreement between independent countries, so that people can see the difference? Will he be a party to holding a consultative referendum on two different proposals? Will be involved in asking people what they think and have an intergovernmental conference called for the purpose of preparing a compromise? We must discuss how the Charter can bind the institutions together without coming into conflict with the constitutions and the European Court of Human Rights; how a division of the Treaty into two parts will not simply make it less likely that there will be referendums in the event of Treaty changes; how more than thirty forms of decision can be reduced to three clear forms of decision; how we are to formulate a right of veto on crucial issues without paralysing the whole process; how the national parliaments are to be associated with the cooperation process and whether they can assume the Commission’s initiative, monopoly and competence catalogue; and how it can be ensured that matters do not just go the same way as did the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the issue of openness, which Mr Watson also addressed, I should like finally to ask you, Mr Aznar, whether you will change Spain’s position and ensure that Parliament receives the same documentation as the Council of Ministers. As a friend of Spain, I particularly welcome you to Parliament, and I hope that you will surprise us by implementing that openness which Sweden did not get anywhere with and which Belgium did not work to bring about. <span class="italic">Bienvenido</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Happy New Year to everybody and congratulations to our President. Yesterday Mr Poettering mentioned the relevance of you being Irish as the best evidence of political success for the small countries of our continent. As a Basque, I was very pleased to hear that, because the Republic of Ireland, which has only existed for a century, can give a European stateless nation like ours a very encouraging example. For that reason too, I wish you good luck and all the best.</p>
<p class="contents">During the coming months, however, the Government of the Kingdom of Spain will be at your side watching how faithfully you are following the path marked out by your predecessor. Let me recall that in 1999 the refusal of the Spanish Government to move from its nationalist blindness threw away the greatest chance for peace in more than a generation. Prime Minister, can you give this Parliament a glimmer of hope by saying that you will be committed to working towards a political settlement of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country? Time is running out. At the end of this week you will have 10% less time left in the term of your European Union presidency. You must hurry up. We are ready for an immediate breakthrough in the present deadlock. I will finish by recalling the words of Mr Watson. He said that it is necessary to recognise that "political problems often require political solutions".</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the debate we are holding today clearly demonstrates that we are at a decisive point in terms of European integration. And I therefore believe that the ambitiousness of the Spanish Presidency’s objectives – any one of them could be described as historic – quite rightly reflects this fact. The truth is that the decisiveness, or even enthusiasm, with which 300 million European citizens have taken on board the euro, suggests that we can look to the future with optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, as an expression of popular will, must now demonstrate its ability to play its role of providing the debate with impetus, a role which has particularly been recognised over the last six months of the Belgian Presidency and as the Spanish Prime Minister has stressed this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We have provided the Commission and the Council with inspiration, for example, in order to provide the justice systems of the Member States with Community instruments which make the defence of freedoms in the face of terrorism more effective. Since the beginning of this legislature, it has been made clear in this House, more than in any other place, that terrorism is a problem and a threat to everybody, and not only to the direct victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the fact that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said that it is necessary to improve the codecision procedure in the next reform of the Union Treaty is an acknowledgement that we should be grateful for.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to deal with this reform by means of the method which was used to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights – which my Group hopes will be incorporated into the new Treaty - that is to say, by means of a Convention which will be inaugurated in March in the headquarters of Parliament, as has been revealed to us this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that that positive attitude from the Council will be maintained throughout the work of the Convention, so that we can respond to two needs: firstly, to bring the Community institutions closer to the citizens by making them more democratic, more efficient and more transparent; and secondly, by undertaking a profound reform of an institutional framework designed for the six founding States, adapting it to a reality in which there are 25 or more Member States, which we hope to see in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations for the enlargement of the European Union – some of the most important chapters of which, as has been said, will be dealt with in the coming months – should not in any way become polluted by domestic debates. On the contrary, in the current Member States, government and opposition should leave aside party-political confrontation in the face of this great Union objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón, we must bear in mind that the success of a Presidency is not measured in national terms, or much less party-political terms. This morning you recognised that you need to take a few classes. I fear that you do not only need computing classes. You spoke like a Spanish Socialist. I trust that you will show the same loyalty that the European Popular Party showed to the two previous Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests from the PSE Group)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must use these six months to make the European Union stronger in the world, participating in international debates by means of the common position. To this end, it is not just necessary to move ahead with the institutional reforms of the CFSP in order to make it more efficient and visible inside and outside our borders, but we must also improve the instruments which the European Union already has, such as the Community external service.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that numerous challenges await us over the next six months, which will demand effort and cooperation from all of us: citizens, European institutions, governments and political parties. We fully trust that this Presidency will represent a step towards a larger and more united Europe, which is more open to the world and closer to the citizens.</p>

Mr Aznar, I know that you have a difficult job, that the international context, in political and economic terms, is complicated and furthermore, as has been said, that the Belgian Presidency has set a very high standard. But have no doubt, Mr President, that the Spanish Socialists will cooperate unreservedly in making the Presidency a success for Spain and for Europe. There will never ever be disloyalty from our side. Others may show some. We hope that you do it well, because we want this Presidency to give Spain prestige within Europe. Therefore, Mr President, your personal effort and that of the members of your government will have to rise to the occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in your communication you have listed Europe’s current priorities. Enlargement, the Lisbon process, the international coalition for freedoms and against terrorism, the single area of security and justice, the external policy, relations with the Mediterranean countries, the role of Europe in Latin America: that is your agenda, Mr President. But we Socialists would have liked to hear you make some specific commitment, an ambitious initiative relating to some of these issues. For example, we would have liked it if, when talking about the Lisbon process, you had stressed the social aspects. Because the Lisbon process agreed a strategic objective which, together with the construction of a more prosperous and competitive economic area, included the objectives of full employment and greater cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Please commit yourself, Mr President, to making all the coordination methods relating to these social agenda strategies increasingly Community methods. Associate the European Parliament, the unions and employers with this process. In our view, this would mean more Europe. I will give another example: the Mediterranean and Latin America are European priorities, but a good Spanish Presidency, given its special closeness and relations with these two regions, should be able to put the emphasis on them. Nevertheless, we do not notice in your programme concrete initiatives to revitalise dialogue and cooperation beyond the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, which by the way was foreseen in 1995 in Barcelona and later in Laeken. You do not tell us how or when you are going to conclude the negotiations with Mercosur and with Chile. We note the lack of concrete commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are glad that you have chosen the motto ‘More Europe’, and not because it is a classic of the Socialist family. I will tell you now that we will not judge you by the number of meetings you hold in six months, but we will judge you on the results. So you must move on from words to actions, Mr President. What do you mean by more Europe? I imagine that it will not be, as Minister Piqué said, that Europe should speak with a single voice in 2050, because, as country folk would say, ‘that is a journey that requires no saddlebags’. I am truly impressed by the ambition of the Minister for External Affairs. More Europe means more security, but also more freedom. More Europe means more employment but also less inequality. More Europe means more democracy and more participation. More Europe also means a Europe that is more active in the defence of human rights. More Europe, in summary, also means less nationalism, of either the old type or the new type.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if you act in this way, we will be the first to applaud you. We want you to be successful and we want to celebrate your success together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of the issues mentioned as priorities for the present Presidency, I would like to stress the following three.</p>
<p class="contents">That the meeting of the Barcelona European Council, in March, provides concrete commitments and results which can be confirmed, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the structural reforms and liberalisation processes necessary for complying with the objectives set in the process initiated at the Lisbon Council.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Euro-Mediterranean Council serves to promote a new stage in the process begun, also under a Spanish Presidency, in Barcelona in 1995, in order to ensure greater and better cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean. We are in favour of the creation of a financial institution which allows the full and effective application of the funds agreed for the Mediterranean programmes. We must intensify the Union’s external policy, in which much of its future peace and stability is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">In your key role as a member of the Praesidium of the Convention, we ask that you ensure the incorporation and participation of the constitutional regions in the institutions of the European Union in the constituent text to be agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference of 2004. As the chairman of the Liberal Group stressed in his speech, the European Union cannot be considered complete unless it includes the full participation and integration of the Europe of the Regions. It is an issue to which, under the Spanish Presidency, which will begin with the Convention, we attach the greatest importance, as has been stressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The priority given by Spain to enlargement is not accompanied by the necessary commitments to guarantee the legitimate objectives of the Objective 1 territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Vital to me, as a supporter of Andalusian autonomy, in order to safeguard the future, are the reform of the common agricultural policy, the debate on rural development, codecision in agriculture and food safety, in order to prevent extremely costly crises and alarm amongst consumers. The presence of the autonomous communities in the Council when issues relating to our interests and competences are dealt with will always be positive and enriching.</p>
<p class="contents">Reflect the reality of Spain in Europe. Do not try to hide it, Mr Aznar. The autonomous communities are also States. A plural Spain in a plural Europe, creating more Union. Take that political and social reality further.</p>

Moreover, such trifling issues do not deserve Parliament’s attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar, the Spanish Presidency’s programme is full of issues to be addressed and objectives, and underlying all the initiatives we can see the commitment to restoring politics to its central place in the debate. Time constraints prevent us from mentioning more than just a few points. Firstly, the common economic policy that you have tackled, which the President-designate of the Commission has pinpointed as key for the future and which confirms the view we expressed in voting for the euro in Brussels: there can be no monetary policy without a strong common economic policy. Secondly, the Mediterranean policy, whose progress must be speeded up because, although cooperation between the intelligence services of the European countries is extremely important to combat terrorism – as we have stressed in the debate on that subject – it is equally true that we need to combat poverty, to restore peace to the Middle East, to re-centre the European Union politically: therefore, we need an incisive Mediterranean policy to be a key part of the forthcoming Barcelona Summit. Thirdly, implementing the concept of More Europe, or More Europe of the Citizens practically, which means we need institutions which are less bureaucratic and more democratic, and we need greater respect for traditions, for the identities of the individual countries, for a Europe which is not just a standardisation machine but generates growth for each country, as the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, said yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we must not forget the Argentinian disaster: the one hundred and twentieth crisis in Argentina since 1975. We therefore also need to address the issue of the speculation bubble, the excessive disparity between the actual economy and – indeed – the official economy; we must tackle the Argentinian problem by providing aid immediately, not least because of the ties of friendship and tradition our countries have with Argentina. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This theme does not break any new ground, as it has, after all, been compulsory for almost fifty years, and it cannot fail to cause us concern because ‘More Europe’ equates to nothing more than the constantly increasing destruction of what makes up the substance of Europe, namely the nations.</p>
<p class="contents">To some extent, however, Spain will not break any new ground. You are not breaking new ground, in particular, in the area that you have made your priority as a head of government, Mr Aznar; in other words, the fight against terrorism. There is something risible about combating terrorism when you appear to be doing everything possible to encourage its growth, both at a superficial and deeper level, in Europe and everywhere else in the world. An obvious example of its superficial growth is the ridiculous and criminal obsession with bringing down borders, which of course does not fail to make police controls increasingly difficult and which, above all, encourages internationalism which has always been the greatest weapon of all forms of terrorism since time immemorial.</p>
<p class="contents">At a deeper level, bringing down borders destroys people’s sense of national belonging, which for centuries has given them a reference point in space and time, and, in other words, a place in history. They thus rediscover their ethnic origins and begin to fight against what remains of the nation State, a fight that we also encourage on occasion. Thus, what is happening in Spain is what happens everywhere else. In our view, we can only combat Basque terrorism by asserting a broad Spanish policy on the international stage, a policy which, fortunately, Spain also has the resources to conduct in Europe, in the Mediterranean and in Latin America. However, Europe does not allow us to be self-assertive.</p>
<p class="contents">At a deeper level still, terrorism is both favoured and encouraged by the deep disorder into which the world is plunging under the battering that the nations are suffering as a result of the sacrosanct dogma of capitalism that is trade liberalisation. This does not only lead to the destruction of the national sense of belonging, which is also one of the sources of Islamic terrorism, but also to the building, on the misleading pretext of globalisation, of a real wall between the rich world and poor world, which has no future and is therefore in the most dire straits.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, it is fortunately encouraging that the nations are showing signs of rebelling, particularly the nations in Europe. Italy and Germany are giving us some positive signs, Denmark and Ireland have already done so, and I am sure that France will too in the days to come. Mr Aznar, this could be your main worry in the coming six months. And if you have made a conscious choice to deny what is really happening at national level, I cannot, we cannot, wish you good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The programme you have presented for your Presidency is extremely dense. I would like, if I may, to put forward a few suggestions which would make it a great, ambitious programme as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I belong to a political family which, unlike many others, has always believed that the only things of any importance are ideas and a vision for the future. Well then, under your Presidency, an old idea we extremists have had for many years regarding law and international law can come to fruition. During your Presidency, you can complete the establishment, for the sake of humanity, of the permanent international court which will bring to justice those accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. It will be an historic moment, a fundamental change, which, together with the Treaties, will introduce an initial element of international jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty ratifications are needed and over 50 have been obtained. Many of our friendly neighbours are far advanced in the process. It is possible, if you want it, and we will all help you – Parliament is going to discuss the issue in February – for the Spanish Presidency to obtain the necessary 60 ratifications in the name and on behalf of 200 million European citizens. I hope that you will embrace this as a historic opportunity for change. Think how different it would be, even where the fight against terrorism is concerned if – as in the case with Slobodan Milosevic, who is a mere war criminal awaiting trial – today, we had the chance to send the Osama Bin Ladens or the Mullah Omars of this world for trial before a permanent international court. Then our American friends would not find themselves having to invent military courts and the like. Well then, we and you yourself have the chance to achieve this, and we are certainly determined to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Mr Aznar, we fully support the fight against terrorism, but what concerns me is the political response, for clearly, military and judicial responses are not sufficient. We continue to follow and implement the principle that the enemy of my enemy is automatically my friend. We are in danger of heedlessly accepting the most unlikely regimes as allies because we need them. Some of these regimes, Mr President, are close by; they may even lie on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point I would like to make. You see, I feel that we are sitting next to a minefield and that a new vision of our relations with the Mediterranean must be the priority for our present and certainly for our immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just a few suggestions, Mr President, but they would help us to be forward-looking in a practical way, which is precisely what our citizens want us to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The speeches by certain Members have reminded me of what Marx said, not Karl but Groucho, about certain literary critics who were so busy writing criticism that they never had five minutes to sit down and read a novel.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to say that the Spanish Presidency has a series of objectives which are being presented straight away, both in terms of the internal dimension of the project and of its external dimension. It is clearly a question of uniting wills, forging consensus and identifying the right direction so that the European Union can make progress. This will require two things. It requires a method, and at Laeken the Convention method was chosen, which is an innovative method: Europe cannot be built on the basis of concentric circles. And it requires ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with what my good friend Mr Watson said, though I congratulate him on his appointment as chairman of the Liberal Group, because I believe that Spain is very well placed to contribute to overcoming one of the historic challenges of our times, which is how to reconcile unity with diversity prudently and judiciously. How to provide the European Union project with a well-tuned orchestra, well-tempered, as Mozart said, which is guided by democratic impulses and not by a blast of a bugle like a battalion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, when freedom was savagely attacked by the barbarity of 11 September, it immediately became clear that notions of security, defence, cooperation, external policy and development aid are interrelated and must be based on a common awareness that the threats and dangers of terrorism affect all of us alike and that we must therefore respond to them as one.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to say a couple of things about Latin America. This Parliament thinks that Latin America does not need gifts, but rather opportunities. But we also believe that we sometimes have to move on from beatitudes to accounting books and we have, therefore, significantly increased the quantities proposed by the Commission for cooperation with these regions in 2002 and we have presented an ambitious catalogue of measures aimed at giving content to that strategic objective, which the Heads of State and Government drew up at the Rio de Janeiro Summit, of creating a strategic bi-regional partnership. Therefore, as the Presidency-in-Office has stated, we hope that the Madrid Summit will be able to send a clear and well-defined message of the Europe’s new commitment to Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced that the storey which this Presidency has to add to this Community building will be a match for the ambitious priorities they have presented to us this morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, it is a reality. The Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to see the same ambitions inform European security and defence policy, and all the events of 11 September have only strengthened this wish. It is a prerequisite for peace and progress. This is why we support the Spanish Presidency if it wishes to inject this ESDP with more dynamism, greater capacity and, in general, more resources to become more effective. In this respect, it is essential for the message of multilateralism to be broadcast. The US’s withdrawal from the ABM Treaty is in conflict with this. We do not want to relapse into a fresh arms race. We would ask the Spanish Presidency to send this European message to our ally, the United States, in particular. We can drive this message home and make this appeal to the US with all the more force now that we, as Europe – in the coalition – are prepared vigorously to continue the fight against terrorism, both inside and outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a second, serious question for the Spanish Presidency. Are you also prepared to fight for a worldwide coalition against poverty? After all, poverty largely forms the breeding ground for fundamentalist hatred, of whatever origin. It must be a coalition against poverty in Asia, in Africa and also in the Euro-Mediterranean process, for security on our planet is not there for the chosen few, but is only stable if it is shared by all, under an international rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Spanish Presidency not agree that it would be better to make financial investments in this instead of putting all our money unilaterally into new, Star Wars-like investments?</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, would you make every effort to help Messrs Solana and Patten to have a fully operational capacity for the Petersberg tasks by 2003?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East, we hear Iran’s ex-Prime Minister, Mr Rafsanjani, threaten to destroy Israel by means of an atom bomb. His saying that is wholly unacceptable. But the policy of Mr Sharon, who has isolated Mr Arafat and has turned innocent Palestinian citizens into victims, has not contributed to security in Israel and Palestine in any way. Is the Spanish Presidency, in tandem with the United States and Russia, prepared to launch a new peace initiative in the Middle East as a whole? We would be very grateful if it did. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Do not forget, Mr Aznar, to deal with the outstanding issues facing us in this six-month period to come, during which enlargement and the euro are presenting the European Community with a very special kind of landscape, in which the whole world is more or less affected for various reasons which oblige us to make constant, permanent and joint efforts to achieve peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">I must remind you that, in our European sphere, in all the pillars of the Community edifice, we have maintenance problems. Therefore, Community policies must include something which you have pointed out: ‘more Europe’. And this is true, especially when it comes to reviewing the CAP, the Structural Funds, the consolidation of the situation of the outermost regions and creating a genuine European immigration strategy. It is also true when it comes to institutional reforms, defining the role and the participation of the regions in the construction of the Europe of the Twenty-first Century and an appropriate environmental policy, without forgetting the fields of social policy, that is, employment and the SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither must you forget, in your dual capacity as President-in-Office of the Council and Spanish Prime Minister, to export more Europe to the world. To this end, we must review the Union’s external relations – such as the Council’s common position on Cuba and the future of the Sahara, by means of a self-determination referendum – without forgetting the dialogue with our Mediterranean neighbours – from Morocco to the Middle East – or with more distant regions, such as Latin America, with the problem of Argentina, or the United States and China.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course you can count on our support, as always, in the joint European political fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you luck in this special mandate and I trust that we will all be able to celebrate together following your success in the June exams, because what is good for Europe is good for everybody, especially the outermost regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, you intend to use your Presidency to indulge your authoritarian obsession against European diversity, denying a presence in the Council to nationalities and regions of the Spanish States, employing a notion of sovereignty which is now anti-historical and anachronistic in the Union. If your approach were correct, Mr Aznar, we would have to concluded that you are appearing here today as a President of a foreign institution.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think like that. I represent my nation and I am also a citizen of the Spanish State and of the Union, and there is no contradiction here. You are mixed up in an authoritarian manner in something which is resolved in the Treaties and in practice, while ignoring the fact that in the future, if we do not deal with the problem of sovereignty, not to mention separatism, we will ask ourselves not only why Slovakia can chair a Fisheries Council while Galicia, Andalusia or the Canaries cannot attend it, but also why the historic national status of the Malta or Luxembourg is rightly recognised, while that of Galicia, the Basque country, Catalonia, Scotland, Wales or Flanders is not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The chapters on agriculture and regional development therefore demand the utmost sensitivity and particular prudence. A discriminating approach is called for, especially as regards direct payments to farmers. If we are not to be reproached for stepping up mass production to excessive levels, we must concentrate more on integrated rural policy in the accession countries rather than carrying over the system of direct payments. Particular negotiating skill will be required in view of the background of difficulties that are manifesting themselves and the mutually opposing interests with regard to support measures. It is indeed a matter of crucial importance that the negotiations should make capacity and sustainability possible for the future, by which I mean beyond 2004 and over and above Agenda 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The presidency has many tasks on the international front; carrying forward the global war on terrorism is the most difficult and the most important.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency has promised to resolutely promote solidarity with the United States at this time of crisis, and it is right to do so, but other foreign problems will crowd in. In Zimbabwe we have a growing tragedy which requires urgent EU action: smart sanctions need to be introduced immediately and a clear message sent about the dangerous consequences of the criminal path on which Mr Mugabe is currently engaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency faces similar challenges on the economic front. If Europe is serious about making itself the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, then Barcelona promises to be a moment of truth. We simply cannot afford continued failure. Europe has to get it right. Since Stockholm things have in fact moved backwards. The liberalising agenda has become bogged down by new social and environmental targets. Since then we have seen at least three new EU directives which directly reduce labour market flexibility, with more in the pipeline, as well as new national laws, as in France, that tie the hands of business. This is a job-destroying agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In the target sectors for greater competition, the picture is frankly unacceptable. In financial services – telecoms for instance – liberalisation is proceeding too slowly. The freeing up of energy markets and postal services is way behind schedule. If Europe really wants to emerge as the global economic leader by the end of this decade, it must show real commitment. We need to make it easier to start and run a business and to keep and invest profits. That means a lot of vested interests will need to be confronted. We look to Prime Minister Aznar to lead the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As parliamentarians we have raised objections to several proposals in the interests of effective and lively parliamentary government, but we have also found agreement with the Commission on a number of things. Something we would both like, Mr President-in-Office, but which the Council has to date refused, is an interinstitutional working party in which we — Parliament, Commission and Council together — could discuss the issues surrounding the new way of governing. I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office, to take care that the Council agrees to this way of proceeding together.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, we are of the opinion that we should in any case be treated equally with the Council, including on the issue of secondary legislation. It is our opinion that we too should have a call back position should the secondary legislation not work well. We take the view, moreover, that framework directives should have a sort of ‘sunset clause’, a time limit.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the Commission in any case that lawmaking and the decision-making process in the European Union should again and again have their effectiveness monitored. This also applies to the area of liberalisation, which we sometimes doubt is being carried out with a careful eye and social awareness. Questions to be considered in this area include, for example, whether liberalisation always leads to lower prices in the long term, whether it always results in competition or sometimes also to monopolies and oligopolies, the only difference being that this time they are across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the chances under liberalisation for the small and medium-sized enterprises about which we are all concerned, especially in the smaller sectors? How about the issue of concentration, especially in the media? Italy has already been mentioned today. We often turn a blind eye to this. What is the net effect on employment and wages?</p>
<p class="contents">I mention these things not because either I or my group are opposed to liberalisation. We mention these things because we want to carry out liberalisation in the interests of our citizens, with a careful eye and social awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be for this reason, Mr President of the Commission and Mr President-in-Office, that some governments are sceptical about liberalisation and slow to implement it, because they feel that it does not always exactly lead to the good objective that is in mind, and because they feel that their own people do not always perceive the advantages to be found in the detail of this liberalisation strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">So I beg to ask you to consider, within the framework of the Barcelona and Lisbon processes, how liberalisation, which you in your programme want to push and press ahead with, can come about in our people's interest, taking the social dimensions into account as well. The continuation of an arbitrary liberalisation strategy cannot be what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst Mr Berlusconi thinks we should strengthen Europe by being more American than the Americans, I do believe we should take our own European road to liberalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to eradicate violence, I would cite the example of the British and Irish Governments, which sponsored the Good Friday agreements and the peace process in Ulster, and I would ask you and the Popular Party not to continue to insist on maintaining your alliance with <span class="italic">Herri Batasuna</span> – protectors of ETA – with the sole objective of imposing a state of political siege on the Basque Government, and instead to promote democratic dialogue with the majority of the Basque people, aimed at resolving the historic political conflict, who wish to live in peace, and to respect their right to decide their future freely.</p>

As strong supporters of the Europe of the peoples we see as brothers – from the Basques to the Corsicans, the Flemish to the Padanians – and therefore also strong supporters of freedoms and autonomies, we identify with the project of European integration, seeing it, not least, as a response to the serious dangers of globalisation. This motto ‘More Europe’ must embrace more specific commitments and actions to protect the freedoms and identities of the Europeans. To achieve ‘More Europe’, we first need undertakings to protect the diversities and specific characteristics – linguistic, regional, national and cultural – for which our peoples are fighting, particularly the people of the Po Valley. This means taking the opposite direction to that advocated by the standardisation directives produced by the technocratic oligarchy, which has not been legitimised by any form of election, and is currently guiding and directing all the European Union’s politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, how could one fail to see the link between the fight against terrorism – which we support – and the dangers represented by illegal immigration, which is the breeding ground for terrorism?

<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that we can make progress on the focal points that you have mapped out. Internationally, and nationally too, all this is tied in with the fight against terrorism, and I would like to say, in response to a speech by one of the previous speakers, that there can be no political justification for terror, which must be rejected both within the European Union and outside it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I have observed over the last few months how you, astutely preparing for your presidency, have not, on foreign policy issues, fallen victim to the peril of bilateralism, which has been seen to some degree in Berlin, London and Paris. I believe this results from the recognition that we can achieve the objectives of combating international and national terrorism and securing peace only by a joint effort and not on the basis of everyone for himself, and that it is for this reason that we must bring about a common foreign and security policy. I am thankful that you evidently are able to go down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">There are yet two more reasons why your presidency comes at a decisive moment. You will, when the Convention begins, be able to emphasise certain features of what the internal configuration of the European Union will be like in the future. We therefore ask you for the support that will give the Convention the working facilities it needs in order to be able to meet these requirements. Your presidency will, though, also see the preparatory decisions on enlargement of the European Union taken, that is to say, on the outward configuration of the European Union in the future. We hope for very close cooperation with you on these issues over the next six months.</p>

We are delighted with this decision, which is of unquestionable symbolic value. We hope that the measures for combating the funding of terrorism in Europe can also be applied soon.</p>
<p class="contents">And I also hope, Mr President, that the Council will maintain the excellent cooperation that it has enjoyed with this Parliament, with the exception of recent times.</p>
<p class="contents">Having adopted the most important instruments for fighting terrorism, we must now see that they are applied. You can and must convince the States which have the most doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out a cause for concern in relation to the question of immigration. Your agenda mentions immigration for humanitarian reasons and the fight against illegal immigration. You miss out an important package: that of rights and duties and that of the organisation of the legal entry of persons. And there are already documents in the Commission in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Please promote the whole agenda, so that we do not have to end up regretting unfulfilled decisions, as happened in Laeken with certain decisions taken in Tampere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not going to get involved in that debate because this is a place for talking about Europe. And we have come here to discuss a programme that combines ambition with vision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very pleased, Mr President, that we are dealing here with a six-month programme during which, as most Members have pointed out, much is going to be done and many initiatives are going to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the tradition of Parliament is to demand that the Presidency-in-Office get things done. But I also believe that, in compensation for the many things that have been demanded today, this Parliament must make a commitment to doing something which seems to me extraordinarily important: the Barcelona process is going to be a key element of the Presidency. The Barcelona process is necessary in order to complete the process started in Lisbon and you have said, Mr President, that there is no better means of achieving social integration than creating employment. We must send a clear signal, at a time when the European economy is delicate, that the European Union is prepared to make this effort and, therefore, this Parliament and this political group commit ourselves to approving, next week in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the report by Mr von Wogau so that we may implement the measures contained in the Lamfalussy report, which I believe will send a clear message to the markets that we are willing to reach an agreement – and I am glad that you are here, Mr Prodi, since the Commission has much to say on this issue – a fair agreement, which respects the balance of the institutions, to liberalise that market. From this point of view, the European Parliament will add to the good initiatives of a Presidency which has ambition and vision.</p>

I will comment on just one of them, namely your determination to complete the single market in the gas and electricity sectors. We have misgivings about your approach. You want the EU to be guided by five major principles: openness, liberalisation, competition, transparency and interconnection. These are fundamental to an open market. Energy, however, is not like other goods or services. It has other facets: basic social need and environmental impact. A rushed and ill-considered liberalisation would be highly dangerous. Your own country, like California, has recently suffered major power cuts following liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation leads to a dash for gas, forcing us to import gas from some very fragile regimes. We need to ensure that indigenous energy sources can play a major role in energy supply. Renewable energies in particular need legal protection and promotion. The greatest contribution to security of supply is intelligent use of energy, one of the regulatory requirements of wise liberalisation. Please ensure that energy efficiency becomes a key national indicator at Barcelona. Uneven opening of the market between countries brings huge resentment. We strongly support your efforts to put pressure on certain governments, which keep their markets closed while they take advantage of open markets elsewhere. I look forward to your assurance that liberalisation of energy will take place in a very strictly regulated framework which protects the environment and takes heed of social consequences, some of which are very serious. Unlike Mr Evans, we think that is important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union’s joint action will be judged initially on the success of the fight against terrorism, which is not an internal Spanish affair but a fundamental issue in which we must all be involved, just as we are with regard to the European presence in Afghanistan. We too will support any undertaking<span class="bold"> </span>in the Middle East because it is only by resolving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis that we will be able to deliver the final blow to the terrorist organisations. Indeed, it is a political effort, above all, as well as military endeavours that can bring Europe success against the instigators of the attack of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">The return to the rule of law in the world will contribute to economic growth and thus help to improve the conditions of the European citizens, whom we also have to provide with a system of social and other protection which abolishes longstanding privileges. The Convention will also have to decide upon the way to follow to develop the new Charter, and we hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to take place during the second half of 2003 to avoid Europe’s future being debated right in the middle of the electoral campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I cannot close without responding to a number of statements made in this House. The strong Europeanism of Italy and of its democratically elected government is indisputable. We are always ready to request or provide clarification and would stress that it is absolutely unthinkable that Italy should have anything but an independent, leading role in the development of European unity. Rather, let the Socialists explain the agreement signed in Berlin with the GDR, with the former supporters of the Berlin wall: an agreement which goes against the great hopes of freedom not just of the German people but of all Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Barcelona Summit will be a major milestone during the Spanish Presidency and it is essential that we reply to the downward global economic trend by further deepening and strengthening the process laid down at Lisbon and further developed at Stockholm and Göteborg.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon policy mix of mutually supportive economic reform, full employment, social cohesion and sustainable development needs to be reinforced through concrete measures that increase the potential for growth and job creation. It would be a grave mistake to concentrate – as some have done in the debate today – on only one aspect of the Lisbon process, that of structural reform. At this time, we need to further develop the coherence of the Lisbon process and reinforce it.</p>
<p class="contents">In concrete terms, we want a number of priorities developed at Barcelona, some of which are reflected in the Commission's synthesis report adopted this week.</p>
<p class="contents">The following are purely illustrative in the limited time available. We want a strengthening of resolve to achieve the goal of a 70% employment rate by 2010, recognising the good progress we have seen and increasing the participation of unemployed people in active labour measures to at least 20% in nearly all Member States; we want to go further and set a new target of 44%, the level in the three best-performing Member States, to be achieved within a five-year timeframe. Within this timeframe we need, among other things, further action for women and older workers able and willing to stay in the labour market; action to improve the availability of affordable and good-quality child care; goals for reductions in youth unemployment and renewed emphasis upon life-long learning, training and improved mobility. We also need further action to address demographic change through an integrated approach to safeguard sustainable and universal pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, ‘More Europe’ must mean more of a political Europe where it is necessary to improve our standing on the international stage and to enable our economies to become stronger and to create further jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain is undertaking its third presidency of the Union and therefore has proven experience in this area. More importantly, the Spanish government led by Mr José Maria Aznar, whom I welcome, is implementing a successful policy which, if applied to Europe, could turn out to be extremely worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned, there is, unfortunately, no need to dwell at length on the tragedies that too often plunge the people of Spain into mourning, as they fall victim to barbaric acts carried out by ETA and its counterparts. It is now easy for us to understand, particularly after the events of 11 September, that the primary concern of the Spanish Presidency is, quite clearly, the fight against terrorism within an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what citizens really expect from Europe, and from the authorities in general, is for us to put in place the conditions to create a competitive economy that will guarantee the prosperity of as many people as possible. Mr Aznar, you know how to do this in Spain; we are sure that you will provide the necessary impetus so that the objective set in Lisbon to achieve full employment by 2010 is consolidated and attained within the framework of a timetable defined at Barcelona in March.</p>
<p class="contents">It will come as no surprise to any of you that, having been elected to represent the island of Reunion, I welcome the will that was clearly expressed by the Spanish Presidency to pursue the implementation of Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that the special characteristics of such regions are taken into account in each of the European Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out to the President-in-Office of the Council that the first meeting of the Convention will not be held at the European Parliament’s headquarters in Strasbourg; it will instead take place in one of our working places, namely Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Spanish Presidency has also rightly indicated the importance of money laundering to terrorism. Because the true driving force of terrorism, at least in Europe, is not ideology, but money. We are concerned about whether it will be possible for the Council to overcome the obstacle standing in the way of fighting terrorism resulting from certain governments blocking the Community proposals on the fight against money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr President, the Spanish Presidency insists on the problem of immigration and the need to control it. The Presidency’s programme also talks about the outermost regions. I wanted to link these two problems by pointing out that the outermost regions, although they are far from the Community’s continental territory, are in fact part of our territory and that it is currently necessary to control illegal immigration into these regions. I do not believe that the procedure adopted by certain local authorities is the appropriate one: i.e. providing free tickets so that illegal immigrants in the Canaries can be transported to the mainland of the continent. But if we do not adopt measures on a Community level, it is possible that other local authorities will feel obliged to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, over recent years it seems that both the Council and the Commission have forgotten where Latin America is. It is as if the navigation charts have disappeared. The Spanish Presidency points to the importance of holding the Ibero-American Summit and, also in the President’s speech, he rightly stresses the importance of helping certain countries such as Argentina and Colombia. I believe it is very important that the Spanish Presidency takes the helm once again, places Latin America on the continent’s navigation charts and, like in the Fifteenth Century, supports, in this new era, the link between the European Union and Latin America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Prime Minister Aznar, we have great faith in you, and we also wish you every success on the sound plans you have for the coming six months.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, an important task is to ensure that the Convention, which is to develop proposals on Europe’s future, gets off to a flying start. It is also important that this be done quickly, and I am pleased to hear it is to be launched as soon as the end of February. I have heard you say that the reform, or deepening, of the European institutions is necessary in order to make a success of enlargement. I could not agree more. I have also heard you call for more co-decision and more transparency. I would like to endorse that too. The European Parliament must become a normal parliament with full legislative powers, and the Council, in its capacity as co-legislator, must become more transparent in its working practices, possibly modelling itself on the German Federal Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support Mr Aznar’s plea for anti-terrorism policy to be accelerated and Europol to be reinforced. Mr Aznar, you are right in saying that tougher action is required to tackle the drugs trade. Together with the trafficking in human beings, the drugs trade appears to be one of the key sources of funding for terrorism. It is high time we clamped down on this evil, and I hope you will receive Dutch support for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with an observation with regard to socio-economic policy. You have spoken of the need for more labour mobility. In my country, the Netherlands, there is a labour shortage. There are tens of thousands, and probably even more than one hundred thousand, vacancies for jobs which cannot be filled. The care sector and public transport spring to mind. These sectors are performing badly because of a shortage of labour. Why are European job agencies not being set up to analyse which countries have labour shortages and which have labour surpluses? Surely it should be possible, with the help of brief language courses, to help the millions of unemployed in Germany to find jobs in the Netherlands, for example. If you could do something about this, you would be helping both the countries with labour shortages and those with labour surpluses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, I admit, a respectable achievement, indeed a transparent one. I have had to listen too often over the last twelve years to Presidents of the Council who, among their priorities at the outset of their presidency, announce things they cannot bring to pass. In this case, you do not even announce anything. I find that very frank, very transparent and very clear. I am very grateful to Mr Salafranca for bringing Groucho Marx into the discussion earlier on. I, too, was reminded of Groucho Marx when I listened to that speech, because I must admit that I found it more than grotesque. Groucho Marx represents the grotesque, and I find it more than grotesque that the Spanish Presidency of the Council, ten years after the Rio Summit and in the year of the Johannesburg World Summit, has nothing to say about the protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar, it is not for your Ministry of the Environment to do that, it is for you to do it. Let me remind you that the last summit, the Summit in Gothenburg, called upon you, the European Council, to use your meeting in Barcelona in the first half of the year to check on what was still needed. You must, then, say something about emissions trading. You must say when you want to ratify the Kyoto protocol. You must, for example, say when you intend to implement the Sixth Environmental Action Programme's strategies for the various industry sectors. In no way is that a matter for the environmental authorities in your own country; it is a matter for you personally. We always consider it important to cooperate closely and well with the Council, and so, Mr Aznar, I offer you assistance should your government have need of it. I am perfectly ready to offer you all my group's suggestions – with all respect of course – as may be necessary to enable you to perform your duties at the beginning of the year.</p>

The actual introduction of the euro is a red letter day for those of us who want to see European integration and economic development. The task for the EU is now to ensure that the euro lives up to the expectations surrounding it. That is why it is a matter of such urgency that Spain should give priority to a dynamic and competitive Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist leader in this House, who otherwise appears to have no interest at all in this debate, adopted a particularly ‘whining’ tone in his remarks on this subject. The fact is that you as a head of government, Mr Aznar, have made a much more dynamic Spain possible, thanks to modernisation of the administration and of economic life. By means of important structural changes and tax reductions, Spain now presents fewer obstacles to new companies’ setting up and has created new job opportunities. That is why unemployment is falling and prosperity increasing in Spain. That may be sad for Mr Barón Crespo, but it is good for Spaniards. It is precisely this transformation that the EU must carry out if the Lisbon process is to be taken seriously. The Socialists have let two out of ten years simply pass by. The Spanish Presidency must now increase the pressure and, instead of just talking, pursue a policy of prosperity, development and opportunities for the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement has now entered a crucial phase. I trust that Spain, which has experienced dictatorship and has secured democracy and freedom through European cooperation, will now guarantee that the Council does not leave anything undone in the work of enlargement under your leadership and that Spain will show the same solidarity and good will as has been shown to your country for fifteen years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am also looking forward to a presidency whose relations with the United States are characterised by friendship, respect and independence. Good luck in what you intend! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved great steps forward in this area, which will allow us to use the Rapid Reaction Force, which will be ready for action from 2003 onwards, to independently carry out what are termed the Petersberg tasks, at least on our own continent and in any case with an appropriate UN mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I would like to add a brief observation to your statements and make a major request of the Spanish Presidency. Taking the observation first, you have described the Rapid Reaction Force as being also an instrument against terrorism in the European Union. I would say that, in our democratic states, the combating of terrorism is primarily a task for the internal forces of law and order and the justice authorities. Should military actions also become necessary, as they did after 11 September, what we call the principle of the rule of law nevertheless remains untouched. My request to the Spanish Presidency is that, where military operations are mounted under the sole leadership of the European Union, there must be the possibility of falling back on the material resources of NATO, especially in transport and reconnaissance capacities, and also, to some extent, in the command structures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is truly astonishing that the agreement we need between the EU and NATO has, through Turkey's resistance, not yet come about. The proposal that Great Britain and the United States, without the EU's mandate, presented at the Laeken Summit, is unsuitable and unacceptable. So I ask that the Spanish Presidency should see to it that we get an agreement with NATO, so that our security and defence policy may be secured.</p>

Two major events have occurred. The people of Europe now have the euro in their pockets. This is an incredible success and we must rapidly construct the political Europe that they lack. The second major event was 11 September, which reminded us, as if this were necessary, of the nature of the new threats hanging over the world. The Spanish Presidency is facing these two challenges. By placing the fight against terrorism at the forefront of its programme, the Spanish Presidency is thus meeting the expectations of a Europe that must become an area of security and a constitutional State for all European citizens. All resources must be properly implemented at European level to strengthen the instruments of the constitutional State, such as the introduction of the European arrest warrant, the freezing of funds, the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the development of Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens, we have to face another challenge. We must bring about a strong, powerful, and therefore democratic, political Europe. The Spanish Presidency will be able to use the work of the Convention so that it can go ahead, at last, with the simplification of the treaties, with the task of clearly dividing up the competences between the European Union and Member States, but, above all, with rapidly bringing about the drafting of a European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">On all of these issues, I know that the Spanish Presidency will press ahead with determination. The programme that was proposed to us today meets the challenges facing us. We know your vision, we know your determination, and that is why we have confidence in you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like the motto ‘more Europe’, chosen by the Spanish Presidency, to be converted this year into the definitive integration of fishing into the single market, and I would like a CFP to be more participatory, a CFP whose definition and application involve the presence not only of central governments but also of the regions, of regions with competences in the field of fishing, and of course economic and social actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing, Mr President, works on an international basis, like the whole of the economy. Its reform cannot ignore this reality. Nevertheless, it worries us to see that the Community fleet’s access to external waters is being restricted and that our fleet is losing fishing grounds rather than gaining them. In six months’ time we will be able to judge this Presidency by its results and see whether it has been able to reverse this trend.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of this economic activity to numerous European regions, most of them peripheral and Objective 1, and its role as an element of economic integration and social cohesion, we want you to take it into account as a priority objective when it comes to strategies for safeguarding the European social model, which you mentioned in your speech. I would like you to make that explicit commitment here, thereby helping this sector to recover its fighting spirit and confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time constraints dictate that we will have to focus on a small number of issues and not waste words. The first issue is the Convention, which will have to supplement the Charter of Fundamental Rights, promoting the Community method and the federalist approach as a guarantee of political democracy, economic integration and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the Lisbon reforms, which have now become intertwined with the launch of the euro. The single currency consolidates the single market and represents a decisive step towards political Europe and a common economic policy. The single currency strengthens Europe’s position in the face of globalisation but means that it is no longer possible for national systems to restore competitiveness by devaluing. The Stability Pact must be respected. In the interests of economic recovery and employment, therefore, the structural reforms, mentioned specifically by President Prodi, need to be pursued with the necessary determination. This strategy must be consistent with the overall goals of integration, cohesion and harmonisation of the series of policies upholding the European social model. It is not easy to pursue apparently conflicting goals in a balanced way, but this is the challenge of the present times.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is the ‘political’ contribution that Europe can make to the fight against terrorism which has been occupying all the major democracies since 11 September. I call, in particular, for the reinvigoration of the Mediterranean policy and for peace initiatives in the Middle East. Spain has, on many occasions, been at the forefront of action addressing these issues.</p>

The results of this political action at European level could not be more heartening.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Union’s immigration policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, requires your drive and your sensitivity towards such a burning issue, which is, I note, one of the Presidency’s objectives. I refer, for example, to the undeniable need to give a boost to Community legislation regulating aspects as important as family reunification, asylum procedure, or reception conditions for asylum seekers, in order to achieve a proper organisation of migratory flows, which effectively combats people trafficking in human need and who are responsible for the tragic deaths that are taking place in some parts of European territory, such as the Andalusian and other Spanish coastlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank you for all of the speeches you have made during this sitting, which I have listened to with the greatest interest. I wish to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that, of course, I share many of the aspirations that you have expressed here today. I also share many of your concerns but nor should it come as a surprise to anybody that I do not fully agree with some of what I have heard. I must of course, say, however, that, in general terms, I have the feeling that the basic elements of the issues, the objectives and the hopes that we, the various institutions and Europe’s citizens in general share are or can, quite reasonably, be promoted for the future, when it comes to putting our ideas and our plans into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, first of all, to emphasise the importance of institutional dialogue and, within institutional dialogue, once again emphasise my commitment. We will have the opportunity to speak about this European impetus and also about the work of the Spanish Presidency, both in March, following the Barcelona European Council, and in June, following the Seville European Council. This is not, of course, to undermine the importance of the appearances by various members of the Spanish government at the various parliamentary bodies of this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I must tell you that, as holder of the Presidency, I see no problem in establishing what some of you have requested: the creation of a working group for interinstitutional dialogue that encompasses the Council, Parliament and the Commission and which will enable us to see clearly how best our work can be carried out. I do not think that the Commission has any problem with this either. Therefore, from this point of view, I am aware of, and agree with some of your concerns, such as the processing of documents concerning the second and third pillars, which must be resolved with all the guarantees required by the circumstances, the facts themselves and by the sensitivity of the matter, as is done in many national parliaments, with guarantees of security and of confidentiality. We can clearly make progress on many of these issues and, therefore, the Presidency will not raise any opposition to the creation of this interinstitutional working group.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus my speech, if I may, on the Presidency’s objectives and work programme and on no other matter. Ladies and gentlemen, we have before us an extremely important opportunity for the European Union, at an historic juncture, which is of great significance. In my opinion, we have before us an opportunity of which we must not fail to take advantage. This opportunity is evident in various situations. The entire world situation has changed following 11 September and in a tragic fashion. The priority in the world today is security and the fight against terrorism. The change that has taken place since 11 September is causing fundamental strategic changes in the world that will define the world of tomorrow, on which the European institutions must reflect, maintain dialogue and on which they must adopt a position for the future. The European Union as such, through its various institutions, cannot remain on the sidelines of the important debate and participation in the profound strategic changes that the world will be seeing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is a very important opportunity from the economic point of view. I say this for various reasons. Firstly, because for the first time we have the euro, our single currency, which is a guarantee of stability and which has been a great success. Secondly, because for structural reasons, to which I shall refer later, our economies need to continue putting their faith in major reforms. Thirdly, because we are going through a period of economic slowdown and unless we can take advantage of the introduction of the euro, providing impetus for economic reforms, we will be wasting an opportunity to help our economies to recover, which is, of course, extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect that must be emphasised is that we are close to concluding a process which has, of course, a huge scope, that we might call enlargement, expansion or whatever we want; but which is, ultimately, the great political process of European unification. This is the objective that would, in itself, of course, fulfil the ambitions of a political generation that is able to look back on European history and which is concerned about planning and organising our future in a reasonable way.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are aware that we must undertake a reform of the institutions, and we have, for this purpose, proposed the Convention and an Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these ambitions provide us with a crucial opportunity. I wish to convey to the European Parliament the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to share ambitions and, at the same time, to work coherently to achieve our objectives more effectively. This is why we have set out various priorities, on which, in response to your speeches, I should like to briefly comment.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to the fight against terrorism, this is no longer a problem affecting only some people, but one that affects all of us, a problem to which some could show greater commitment, but it is quite clearly the responsibility of everyone. Of course, I appreciate, as I have said, the work and the efforts that the European Parliament has devoted to this matter. Of course, we have to consider the fight against terrorism not only in itself but also in relation to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, and to the Tampere commitments that are part of this more integrated Europe that we wish to build for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Various speakers, in particular Mr Poettering, have called for us to be resolute in the fight against terrorism. They are right. We must ask ourselves if in general terms, the European Union is capable at this historic juncture of dealing with the task in hand. I would say that it is reasonably capable, that the European arrest and surrender warrant – supported, of course, by all Fifteen Member States of the Union – the fight against the funding of terrorist organisations and the definition of a list of groups of organisations and persons that support terrorism are extraordinary steps. It is my fervent hope that in its sitting of 5 February, the European Parliament will also take a definitive step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">How can this be done? This must be done on the basis of the guarantees provided by the Rule of Law. You are quite right, ladies and gentlemen, in saying that the Rule of Law and our freedoms must be fully guaranteed. It is also true, and it should not be forgotten at this time that this is exactly what safeguards democracies and that this is exactly what these people wish to destroy and what those who dedicate themselves to carrying out or supporting terrorism wish to put an end to.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining democracy through the Rule of Law is precisely, of course, our best guarantee. There cannot be – and indeed there are none – half-way houses in the fight against terrorism, because there are no half-way houses between life and death, between legality and lawlessness, between respect for the law and complicity with terrorism. What there must be is a clear defence, when necessary, from an international point of view, by means of an international coalition, and, when necessary, with the domestic commitment or with the international cooperation of all, to ensure that our freedoms and our Rule of law triumph. And in order to achieve this, we have to work, from an operational perspective, on issues of security, intelligence, cooperation between police forces, joint investigation teams and also on the common judicial issues that are a crucial part of the process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if we are coherent and consider terrorism to be one of the greatest threats currently facing our civilisation, we will have to include terrorism as an objective in the definition of the European Union’s security and defence policy. I think that this is a very important aspect and warrants very special treatment, at least in two chapters of relations that are highly relevant to the European Union: the first concerns the United States, with whom we also have discuss legal and criminal matters, whilst at the same time, of course, respecting our extradition system and maintaining our position of clear opposition to the death penalty, or of support for the jurisdiction of the courts and for all the sentences that can be handed down to an individual. But we have to discuss such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to discuss matters in order to reach conclusions on some of your concerns about the importance of cooperation with Russia in the fight against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Aznar,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I wish to tell you that, in this context, we can move ahead with the creation of the International Criminal Court, with improving the instruments of international legal security. But in this chapter in the fight against terrorism I would like to conclude by making one thing quite clear: let us never forget – I know that the vast majority of this House has not forgotten – the moral lesson which these victims have taught us and let us never lose sight of our fundamental responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Failing to condemn terrorism and yet talking about ‘dialogue’, supporting terrorism and yet talking about ‘dialogue’, murdering and yet talking about ‘dialogue’, apart from being a mistake, is an insult to common sense and to the memory of those individuals who have given their lives or who risk their lives precisely to protect human rights, freedom, the Rule of Law and democracy, especially in certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I should like to highlight, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that the euro is a European success and perhaps, therefore, we can discuss, amongst ourselves, a more or less exhaustive list of names of people who could be key players or who deserve to be recognised on the euro. Above all, however, this is clearly a success for Europe, for European society, for its institutions and for Europe’s citizens. It is a success for those who conceived of the idea and who promoted it, for those who saw it through, for those who put it into practice and, above all, it is a success for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say, ladies and gentlemen, that the euro is not a point of arrival, but a point of departure, so that having cleaned up our economies in Europe – a process which we must maintain and continue – we must preserve the ambition of the Lisbon strategy, which is a Europe of full employment, a Europe that is more competitive and better equipped, in terms of people’s well-being, to face our future options in the world. This is clearly the path we need to take. This is why linking the introduction of the euro to the process of economic reform and situating this within the scope of the Barcelona European Council is absolutely crucial for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to briefly remind you all of some figures. In the 1990s, the United States of America experienced growth every year, except one, of more than 3%. In the 1990s, the European Union experienced growth every year, except one, of less than 3%. As I mentioned in my opening speech, the European Union has fallen behind the United States by six income points. As I said, the capacity for technological renewal in the United States and for European investment in North America, which has been better received there than in the countries of Europe, has caused a deep-seated crisis in Europe’s economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we would be making a mistake if we did not realise that there are structural factors, in addition to those resulting from the current economic crisis, that warrant our attention. This is why Barcelona, at this juncture, now that the euro has been introduced, represents an absolutely crucial challenge. A challenge to do what? The challenge to realise the objective of full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may be allowed to put it this way, I am one of those who still believes that the best social policy, the best policy with which we can show solidarity and also the policy of common sense is the one that enables us to create employment and boost economic growth and which, therefore, helps societies to prosper and to be fairer, more equitable and to show greater solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly the issue at stake. This is why we are discussing transport, energy and the financial plan. I hope that the Commission and Parliament are able to effectively resolve their recent differences and set out the financial action plan. This is why we are discussing education and employment. This is the method we must use to work towards a Europe of greater competitiveness and progress. Unless we do so – and I am here giving you my personal opinion – we will see an economic recovery in the United States which will provide that country with many advantages over Europe in terms of competition and in terms of employment and the economy. This is something that no-one should confuse with the significance of not maintaining or of questioning the European social model. The only way in which we can preserve the European social model is by making it sustainable, viable and fundable, and this is achieved through growth and employment, which are, of course, the approaches that we have to support.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I have already referred to my solid commitment to enlargement. On this point, I shall mention three specific issues. Enlargement can, and should, take place and we must work to ensure that this objective is achieved on 31 December of this year. There are three basic conditions that must be fulfilled: First of all, the principle of differentiation: it must be the candidate countries which are ready that are allowed to join. Secondly, respect for the Community acquis: the Community acquis cannot be questioned if we want enlargement to be achieved within the deadlines that have been set; and thirdly, respect for Agenda 2000, for the commitments given in Berlin, which contain and explain the basic elements of enlargement. If these three pillars are respected, the negotiating chapters and the common positions will lead to the historical process of enlargement. Reforms will have to be carried out and decisions taken in the immediate future, but we will have made a major contribution to the great political process of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I should like to refer to an issue that is closely linked to this: the establishment of the Convention, institutional reforms and the idea of more Europe. I, ladies and gentlemen, believe in an integrated and diverse Europe. I understand that there may be some people who feel that more Europe, that a more integrated Europe will put an end to the current legal and political situation or to national States as we know them. This will not happen and the integrated Europe that has brought us this far is something history has never seen before, which represents a great success and is something that we must be able to preserve in all its diversity. Furthermore, each national State will be responsible for democratically arranging its distribution of competences between the national State, between communities or regions and between local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, a fellowship of States, will be responsible for providing the means of participation, but let us not confuse points of view or possibilities, and let us not institutionally change something that has provided Europe with guarantees of security, prosperity, freedom and economic success. From this moment on, the Convention will have to undertake its work under the terms that have been agreed and the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 will have to undertake its own by representing the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I shall refer briefly to issues concerning external and common security policy. I wish to say that once European defence policy has been declared viable, the development of the second pillar is absolutely fundamental. I agree with the honourable Member who said that appropriate operational agreements could be concluded with the North Atlantic Alliance. It is absolutely crucial that these agreements are concluded in a Europe of security and defence that does not, in reality, exist and whose absence we complain about on a daily basis. I hope that the Member States which have greater responsibility for facilitating these agreements are sensible enough to do so in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must and we can assume more responsibilities in the field of security and, naturally, this is also one of the most significant challenges we face for the future. In terms of potential basic strategic elements of priorities, I mentioned, although I shall not dwell on this, the United States and Russia. I should like to express my conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that this dialogue with those two countries will determine a large part of the future of our fellow Europeans. Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, we shall have many important issues to discuss, one of which is the Mediterranean dialogue. This is not simply something that the Spanish Presidency wishes to promote but a vital European need in the Europe of the euro and in the Europe of enlargement. So I do not continue much longer and with my apologies, Mr President, I shall mention only one fact, because the terms ‘solidarity’ and ‘development’ have been mentioned on more than one occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">If the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean wish to maintain their current levels of unemployment and resources, they will have to have created 40 million jobs within ten years. This is a considerable challenge from the point of view of the demographic rate and of the economic situation of the countries of the southern Mediterranean. It is an absolutely crucial challenge for all European countries and we would do well to think vary carefully about what we can do to respond to these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that Latin America – the second European Union, Latin America and Caribbean Summit will be held in Madrid; the first was held in Rio de Janeiro – must be a strategic priority for the European Union and is also important for development and for world stability. Ladies and gentlemen, these were the observations I wished to make at the first appearance of the Spanish Presidency in this House.</p>
