<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">González Álvarez </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, no one doubts the need for a new programme of Community action in the field of civil protection, in this instance to 2004, in spite of the House"s lack of enthusiasm for such a programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, the so‐called ‘natural" disasters that occurred – although I do not believe that they are always natural – caused 50 000 deaths and losses amounting to ESP 12.4 billion as a result of floods, fires, hurricanes, such as hurricane Mitch, and environmental disasters, such as the problem in Doñana, which has yet to be resolved and which is still causing difficulties. In all of these disasters, civil protection organisations play a vital role, especially if these organisations operate well, if their members are highly trained and if they also form part of a Community cooperation network.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection approved by a substantial majority have developed several aspects of the Commission"s proposal which we believe to be important.</p>
<p class="contents">a) Greater and more effective cooperation between the Member States is needed as there is insufficient cooperation at present.</p>
<p class="contents">b) The Community must help ensure that there is a better and more intelligent relationship between the protection of persons and goods and nature, which in the future may make it possible to prevent disasters that can be prevented, as many of them can.</p>
<p class="contents">c) Special mention must be made of the isolated and outermost regions and the difficulties they experience because of their geographical situation, terrain and social conditions. Last week our group met in Madeira where we had the opportunity to visit several isolated communities. Given the difficulties the people there have in exporting their agricultural produce and the difficulties the Members experienced in travelling there, I cannot see how, in the event of a disaster, for example, these people could possibly cope without adequate resources. Some colleagues who had come over from the Azores could not even travel directly to Madeira. Instead they first had to travel 1 300 kilometres from the Azores to Lisbon and then a further 900 kilometres from Lisbon to Madeira. They therefore had to travel an enormous distance to participate in the group"s work which, on this occasion, centred on ways of tackling the problems facing the outermost regions. It is therefore vital to pay more attention to the problems these regions suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">d) The importance of training is to be highlighted to help citizens protect themselves, even in the event of an environmental emergency. I cannot forget some of the environmental emergencies experienced in my country and also throughout the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">e) We would stress the need to step up efforts at national, supra‐regional, regional and local level in the area of prevention, cooperation and the exchange of experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">f) We also propose that we should detect and analyse the causes behind these disasters and publish these findings so that they can be used as the basis for prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted the amendment tabled by the Committee on Budgets and are thus ratifying the European Parliament"s position on the committee needed to implement the programme, which should be a consultative body. This amendment proposes that the committee should be more transparent and participative. We therefore do not agree with Amendment No 24, tabled by Mr Schnellhardt, which proposes that this committee should be of a different nature, even though it does defend the Member States, including my own. We believe that we must continue to defend the European Parliament"s policy regarding these committees.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the vital role that non‐governmental organisations have to play.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment has accepted the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets on cooperation with the countries participating in the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes, that is, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, although as rapporteur I had my doubts. We are not against such cooperation, but we are concerned that a small budget of EUR 2 million also has to cover cooperation projects with these countries. Nonetheless, these amendments by the Committee on Budgets were approved by the Committee on the Environment and I must defend them here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets is also concerned that 25 % of the cost of this programme is taken up by administrative expenditure. However, the draftsman of the opinion – who is not present – does acknowledge that this might be due to the cost of experts, networking, analysis and training. In other words, it is not surprising that administrative costs are so high, although they should be reduced where possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, although this programme does not generate much enthusiasm, Commissioner – as I said at the beginning – I believe that it is important. I am aware of the work people are carrying out, sometimes on a voluntary basis, in civil organisations, especially in the regions, and I believe that if we work to ensure that these organisations continue to operate, we will be able to help prevent or mitigate the effects of some disasters.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I agree entirely with your remarks. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and especially its rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for the work which has been done and also for the interest she has shown during the consideration of this proposal. As you know, and as has also been mentioned, the purpose of this proposal is to ensure the continuation of the current action programme in the field of civil protection, which is based on the Council Decision of 1998 which expires on 31 December 1999. I also think that this programme, which is aimed at supporting and supplementing the efforts of the Member States in the area of civil protection, is an important one, and it is important to make it as effective as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty‐three amendments have been tabled, of which the Commission is able to accept 14. We believe that they help to improve the text and also to clarify it. Some of the amendments emphasise the gaining of experience, which forms part of the basic principles of the programme. Some call for greater involvement of the public and NGOs, and then there are some which strengthen the environmental aspects. We are therefore able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18 and 22. Finally there is Amendment No 23, which is acceptable in part, and Amendment No 19, which is acceptable in principle. Amendment No 19 and parts of Amendment No 23 are aimed at increasing the involvement of NGOs in civil protection, which is something I naturally agree with, and so I also accept this in principle because it gives NGOs the opportunity to participate in the exchange of expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are a number of amendments which we are not so happy with. These are Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21 and 24. I recognise that some of them attempt to improve cooperation with countries participating in the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes. That is of course an objective which commands a great deal of sympathy, but where civil protection is concerned, such cooperation is organised outside our action programme. At the moment, two projects are being carried out under PHARE and MEDA, and a third, which may be financed through TACIS, is in preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to the second part of Amendment No 20, because there it says that, if isolated regions are involved, the maximum financial contribution for pilot projects should be up to 100 %, instead of the 50 % proposed by the Commission. It is our firm belief that responsible budget management also requires joint financial responsibility on the part of the participants in the project, and so we cannot accept the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs González Álvarez also mentioned the question of the comments by the Committee on Budgets on the proportion of administrative costs in relation to the total operating budget, and Mrs González Álvarez made some very sensible remarks on that. In my department, we are currently in the process of examining this question, and it is of course important to ensure that these administrative costs are kept to a minimum when the programme is implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that through its cooperation, Parliament will help to ensure that the proposal now before the House is adopted quickly, so as to ensure continuity between the Community's current action programme and the proposed programme, which is due to enter into force on 1 January 2000.</p>
