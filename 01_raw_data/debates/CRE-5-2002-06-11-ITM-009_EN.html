<p class="contents">In Rio, the so-called Agenda 21 was defined, which contains the fundamental objectives to be achieved during this century. Nevertheless, although important progress has been made, the global environment has continued to deteriorate significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Johannesburg will bring together all the States, all the interested parties, the NGOs, the private sector etc., to draw up new mechanisms for achieving that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">This summit is intended to deal jointly with the economic challenges – development in the sense of pure economic growth – the social challenges – the reduction of poverty, achieving the aims of the United Nations Millennium Declaration – and the environmental challenges. The understanding is that these three challenges are interrelated.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Johannesburg Summit are expected to include the following elements: a political declaration which represents a renewed commitment by world leaders to achieve the objectives of the Millennium Declaration and the shortcomings in the application of Agenda 21, an action programme with fundamental action commitments, voluntary cooperation initiatives which involve all agents, governments, civil society and the private sector in a series of initiatives to implement the action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is actively working on the six priorities for Johannesburg in the areas of health, water, energy, trade, global public assets and sustainable models for production and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">I will firstly comment on the preparatory work done during the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">During this period there have been two preparatory conferences at world level, held in New York: PREPCON 2 and PREPCON 3, and on 24 May the last preparatory conference began in Bali, PREPCON 4, which includes the ministerial meeting of 4 to 7 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in Brussels the Community positions have been prepared by means of a process made up of the following stages: the conclusions of the Environment Council of 4 March which were endorsed by the Barcelona European Council, the conclusions approved by the Development Council on 30 May and, finally, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 17 June, based on the previous ones and on the results of PREPCON 4, which will be adopted by the Seville European Council as the European Union’s global position for Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">On the level of the fifteen Member States, the debates have focused on the following issues, which must be resolved at the General Affairs Council of 17 June, immediately prior to Seville: firstly the coherence of Community policies, without prejudice to the adaptation of Community policies to the internal and external objectives of sustainable development. We must prevent the Johannesburg Summit dictating the nature of the reforms of Community policies. Secondly, the removal of subsidies prejudicial to the environment. Although chapter 2, on trade, achieved a formula for compromise, reducing and, where necessary, removing subsidies considered harmful to the environment, there is still no consensus amongst the Member States on the obligatory or automatic nature of the removal of those subsidies. The Council will also refer to the Swedish initiative of the ombudsman to facilitate exports from the developing countries to the Community market. A more in-depth study is required before it can be accepted and included at the Johannesburg Summit as a Community initiative. To this end, the Commission has committed itself to presenting a document in the future to deal with the possible implementation of that initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial issues, such as those relating to the possible link between funding and the future initiatives established during the Johannesburg Summit, will also be dealt with, and these financial issues are those which are essential so that the additional official development aid resources, agreed to during the Monterrey Conference, are implemented or allocated to the initiatives established in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The mobilisation of alternative funding resources, with the intention of combining alternative resources, such as the so-called Tobin tax, with global public assets and the possible extension of the ‘Highly-indebted poor countries’ initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will comment on the perspectives in the run-up to the Seville European Council. The Presidency has done much work in preparing for the Johannesburg Summit. The European Union must make a very significant contribution to this summit and demonstrate a great capacity for leadership, because we are world standard bearers for sustainable development. I believe that the ratification by the Union of the Kyoto protocol offers proof of this and furthermore because the international preparation of the summit clearly requires European leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment there is disunity at international level and there is a lack of clarity in the intended objectives for the summit. PREPCON 3 was disappointing and the new proposed action programme must have greater consensus and must be more specific.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States wants to minimise political issues as much as possible and would even like to remove the political declaration and the action programme in order to concentrate on implementation. Furthermore, the United States’ focus in relation to implementation is innovative: it wants to create new ‘transfunds’ which can bring together public and private money, which is rejected by several European partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency believes that the European Union should play a role similar to the one it played in Monterrey: to seek consensus with our main partners. As soon as possible we must coordinate our efforts with JUSCANZ, the group made up of the USA, Japan and Canada, and with the Group of the 77. Maximalism and political confrontation get us nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Monterrey was a success, because the European Union worked throughout for a consensus, and if practical results were achieved to benefit developing countries, then in Johannesburg we must try to do the same. If we do not achieve this, the ghost of Durban and the problems during that summit will weigh heavily on Johannesburg. One-thousand-five-hundred non-governmental organisations are going to participate, some of which are very radical. Some seem more interested in confrontation than in achieving concrete results which benefit the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At the PREPCON 4 in Bali, we have tried to reach consensus on a short action programme with a clear focus. A political declaration must be very short, very clear and prevent confrontation, and must be aimed at implementation and practical issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, it is important that the European Union has a communication strategy with which to confront the Johannesburg Summit. We must have a clear vision of what we want in Johannesburg and of how we want to communicate that vision to world public opinion, but above all European public opinion, which, as I said before, has led the way on all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the presidency believes that the global pact which we intend to create on the basis of the results of Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg, must be founded on the principles of democracy, respect for human rights and good government.</p>
<p class="contents">The developing countries must respond to the financial efforts of the developed countries by combating corruption and acquiring firm democratic values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the European Commission's role in the UN Ministerial preparatory conference in Bali, at which I represented the European Commission, was facilitated by the comprehensive reports prepared by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Lannoye and discussed with my colleague, Mr Nielson, at Parliament's part-session last month.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agreed with Parliament last month that the preparatory process for the world summit is not going as well as we would like. This remains our assessment after the Bali meeting. As we have heard, three documents are being prepared for Johannesburg: an action plan on sustainable development, drawn up under the leadership of the UN-appointed chairman, Dr Salim, secondly a political declaration and thirdly criteria for the launching and monitoring of partnerships to implement the actions and political commitments agreed in Johannesburg. None of these documents was finalised in Bali, but while the Bali meeting to prepare for Johannesburg was not a breakthrough, it was not a breakdown of the process either.</p>
<p class="contents">There was intensive EU coordination throughout the meeting in Bali. Ministers agreed that the key EU objectives to be achieved were, firstly, the setting of clear targets and time-frames, especially for water, sanitation and energy, secondly the establishment of a clear linkage between the political commitments and targets in the proposed action plan, and their implementation through initiatives or partnerships, and thirdly an agreement on the shift to sustainable patterns of consumption and production.</p>
<p class="contents">Some progress was made in these areas in Bali, as well as on issues such as health, Africa, small island states and the environment and some of the differences between delegations were reduced. However, the meeting was dominated by the developing countries' insistence on trade and finance issues. The G 77 group pressed for the creation of a world solidarity or poverty fund based on voluntary contributions from public and private funds. Whilst it said that it did not wish to reopen agreements reached in launching the trade round in Doha or at the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterey, the G 77 group was seeking signals from the developed countries which could lead to increased market access for developing in addition to least-developed countries and ways of constraining those that have not yet clearly committed increased resources under the Monterrey Consensus to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the developed countries have always made it clear that market access questions would have to be discussed in the World Trade Organisation in the context of the Doha development agenda and that there would be no new public funds for development beyond what had been pledged in Monterrey, the positions taken by the G77 representatives, led by Venezuela, inevitably led to an unfortunate standoff between the developing and developed countries. This blockage in the means of implementation meant that we were unable to achieve the breakthrough we were looking for in Bali.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst useful progress was made in cleaning up the text of the action plan, large parts – including some key EU objectives – have not been agreed. All these issues will have to be sorted out either in informal meetings or actually at the Johannesburg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">A successful outcome in Johannesburg now depends on finding ways of bridging the gap between the developed and developing countries over trade and finance issues. The EU position has a lot of appeal for developing countries, not least because it seeks, inter alia, to promote common commitments on increasing trade-related assistance and capacity building beyond pre-Doha levels, to search for innovative ways to encourage trade in sustainable products and to encourage the emulation of the European "Everything but Arms" initiative. The European Union therefore can, and must, play a constructive role in bringing the parties together.</p>
<p class="contents">However, unless a satisfactory solution is found, there is a risk that the Johannesburg meeting will be dominated by acrimony over the issues of trade and finance and the focus on sustainable development risks being lost. If that happens, the opportunity to make progress with sustainable development could be missed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for leadership. The South Africans are now in the driving seat and will need our help and support to pull things together in the coming weeks. The European Union will need to play its part in overcoming differences in the next few weeks. Future meetings, such as the Seville European Council and the G8 meeting, as well as bilateral contacts, will provide important opportunities for review and discussion by developed countries on how to respond to G77 concerns without reopening the Doha and Monterrey agreements. We will need to work closely with G77 to re-establish a climate of trust and partnership and explain our globalisation and sustainable development agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the political context, we will also continue our technical work to build support for our partnership initiatives, which can bring real benefits to developing countries in terms of poverty reduction, health and educational improvements and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Together we must ensure that the European Union plays a leading role in ensuring that the outcome of Johannesburg is ambitious and action-orientated. The European Parliament is an advocate of sustainable development. We must bring a sense of urgency to the preparations for Johannesburg in the short time that lies before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the various nations proved incapable of overcoming their national self-interest makes us extremely apprehensive about the outcome of the Johannesburg Conference. There is even a definite feeling in the air, it could be said, that failure is a real possibility. Given the degradation of the environment and of social conditions that we have been seeing, the Johannesburg Summit is crucial to producing a blueprint for a more harmonious planet. Failure would not only be unacceptable but also an outrage. We must build bridges in order to save this Conference, but, and let me state this clearly, in the run-up to Johannesburg many countries are adopting a blocking approach, others a more passive approach and I do not believe I am far off the mark in saying that, objectively, only the European Union is setting off for Johannesburg with the desire to give an ambitious worldwide commitment to sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, and because we cannot waste the kind of opportunity we have not had for ten years and which is unlikely to be repeated in the next ten, the European Union must play a leading role. This applied to the Kyoto Protocol, and must apply to the Johannesburg Summit. The EU must demonstrate leadership that results in the definition of concrete policies, timetables and targets in fields such as biodiversity, the ‘greening’ of the economy, financing for developing countries, energy, water and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">This leadership cannot be underpinned, however, by institutional imbalance, with the Commission and the Council on one side and the European Parliament on the other. We must learn from the mistakes, but also from the successes of the past. The role of the European Parliament delegations such as, for example, at the decisive conferences for the Kyoto Protocol, in The Hague, Bonn and in Marrakech, a role, as a matter of fact highlighted by the Commission and the Council, leads us to think that we need to give the European Parliament a more fitting role for this Johannesburg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, out of respect for the citizens that we represent here, I believe it is crucial that the European Parliament has the right not only to send a delegation of 25 Members of this House, but also and above all the right to have its representatives participate in the daily European Union coordinating meetings. The European Parliament does not want to negotiate – we are familiar with the Treaties. It is not the European Parliament’s task to negotiate, but we do want Parliament, the Commission and the Council to maintain unity in Johannesburg and in order for this to help make the Conference a success, it is essential that Parliament has the right to participate in these European Union coordinating meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a way, every meeting prior to Johannesburg is the cause of ever increasing depression. It would have been better if the political leadership we are now beginning to talk about had been assumed in time. At five minutes to midnight, it is a little late to begin talking about political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to be wise after the event or to confront either the Commission or the Council but, before the Gothenburg Summit last year, we in the European Parliament said, ‘Make sure that external relations are included when we devise a sustainability strategy’, ‘Make sure that, when we adopt our own sustainability strategy, Johannesburg is a natural part of this’ and ‘Do not delay’.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than end up in the doldrums we are now experiencing, I should like in a way to have seen the banner kept flying a little higher en route from Gothenburg to Johannesburg. The Commission has done an excellent job and done as much as it could. On the other hand, the Council’s enthusiasm in the run-up to Johannesburg has been, to say the least, conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament may be talked about as the advocate of good causes, but it is no use our standing here in the Chamber and pleading our own cause when we do not obtain the relationship we need, either with the Council or the Commission, on this issue. It seems a bit pointless simply to tag along to Johannesburg as a kind of icing on the cake. We must, in any event, have political influence.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, more than ever, do we need political direction. We need clear timetables for the millennium objective, and we need a clear division of responsibilities. It is not enough to say that the people of the world need water. Instead, we must talk about who is to arrange for the water to be provided. It is not enough to say that people must have access to food if we do not say who is to ensure that the food reaches their tables. Obviously, trade and funding must be part of the picture. These are, in a way, the lynchpins. We know that they are a part of sustainable development. What, however, I am looking for, especially on the part of the Council, in the run-up to Johannesburg is commitment, conviction and an ability to see things in context.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act as a bridge between the poorest countries and the G77 Group. That much is obvious. We must strike up a dialogue. That is not something we shall do in Johannesburg. It is something we must work on in the short time that remains before Johannesburg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All too many people are affected by deadly diseases such as malaria and AIDS, a fact which threatens the growth and development we all desire. The way forward is more growth and prosperity in the developing countries – growth and prosperity which must be combined with sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two factors crucial to growth and prosperity. There is the ability to trade freely across national frontiers – that is to say, free trade – and there is limited state power, free from corruption, in the form of a constitutional state. It is tariff barriers, and not free trade, which create poverty. Secrecy creates both poverty and stagnation, and we must therefore secure an agreement that breaks down tariff barriers and that guarantees free trade, as well as developing countries’ free access to the market, and we must begin with ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also require something of the developing countries, however. We must require, and tighten up our demands for, democracy, sound governance and the observance of human rights. We must secure international agreements on environmental protection and the fight against deadly diseases. The developing countries are clear about the fact that, if they are isolated, their opportunities for prosperity will be crushed. Unfortunately, the rich countries often put obstacles in the way of developing countries’ growth, especially by demanding duties, setting up obstacles to trade under cover of environmental regulations and subsidising their own agricultural production. In that way, the rich countries bear a large share of the responsibility for the problems of the developing countries. There is a need for a fundamental change of course. We need to break down all the tariff barriers and phase out all the obstacles to trade. Our challenge and task are to get all the rich countries to comply with the UN’s objective whereby 0.7% of Gross National Product would be granted by way of development aid, but we must go on making demands of the developing countries in terms of economic reforms and better governance. In Johannesburg, we must take a decisive step in the direction of a global reform programme for freedom and prosperity. We owe that to the future, and it is something which Parliament and the EU must work for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that is a generally-held view. We must learn from this failure at once. We have very little time left before Johannesburg. There is a risk of a concept we do not want, the concept of the privatisation of sustainable development, being imposed at Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström<span class="bold"> </span>has just referred to the voluntary partnership agreements with private companies. I believe we must avoid lapsing into ideology: we must see the partnership agreements as a potentially useful tool to complement the policies, but they must have a political framework and each party must be fully aware of the context in which they are operating. This, however, must not replace voluntary government policies, although that is clearly what certain parties involved would like, and I am thinking in particular of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union, as Commissioner Wallström<span class="bold"> </span>said, must be ambitious in its goals for Johannesburg. In order to achieve our goals, however, we need allies. Perhaps we should prioritise dialogue with the countries that expect a lot from us, that is to say the poor countries; I think, for example, that the G 77 group is one group we must certainly prioritise. In this respect, I think that two proposals would give very positive political signals to these countries. The first, as explained by the President-in-Office of the Council, would be to propose that we change the European policies which prevent developing countries and the poorest countries from making progress towards sustainable development or meeting their basic needs. I am thinking in particular of aid for agricultural exports. It is unacceptable for us to continue to maintain an aid system for exports which penalises these countries. We must therefore make a significant gesture in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal would consist of promoting a legal framework imposing constraints on transnational companies to encourage them to fulfil their environmental, social and economic responsibilities. It is not acceptable that, while States are constrained by international rules, transnational companies, which are sometimes far wealthier than States, are completely free and unrestricted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too was disappointed at what I read and heard of events in Bali. However, I am also disappointed by what the presidency had to say and I should like to ask a few specific questions:</p>
<p class="contents">What are the real problems? What was the opposition? Who is responsible for the stalemate, or rather the failure of Bali? We are talking politics here. We did not come here to provide a shoulder to cry on. The Commissioner gave a number of details, but we need far more than that. Are you going to say anything about the deal between the United States, Canada <span class="italic">et al </span>and the petroleum producing countries and how it is stopping renewable sources of energy from taking off? Are you at long last going to give us a more political opinion on the increasing unreliability of important partners with whom we are perhaps still hoping to broker agreements in Johannesburg? I agree with what Mr Lannoye said about our policies; they have to change. Following Bush's policy towards American farmers, who seriously believes that there can be the tiniest change in Europe towards European farmers?</p>
<p class="contents">We really do need to find reliable allies. And they really are to be found among the poorest in the world. We really do have to say something to persuade them. Leadership succeeds not by what it says but by how it persuades. So, first, there is the Kyoto and the Cartagena way. We can continue along this course, even if unreliable partners pull out. There are huge efforts which can be made both on the question of trade relations and on the question of funding, without overturning what was agreed in Doha and Monterrey. And even greater efforts can be made, especially with regard to public assistance. There is the question of administration, what some refer to as <span class="italic">gouvernance</span>. We demand good governance on the part of developing world countries and we are incapable of good governance of the world per se, with institutions, rules, resources, funding, possibly even taxes, which we are quick to reject.</p>

It is unfortunate and almost embarrassing that the talks in Bali concerning a global agreement on sustainability in actual fact broke down. It shows the rich world’s unwillingness to commit itself when it comes to the key issues of globalisation, trade and development. The rich countries have still not fulfilled the pledge they made in Rio. The developing countries are therefore justified in expecting these issues to be dealt with. The developing countries want, and should be given, guarantees that the industrial countries are beginning to phase out state subsidies for agriculture and that the additional aid for the environment and for sustainable development, promised to them in Rio ten years ago, is in fact on the way. The rich countries have so far been very dismissive, however. The United States does not wish to make the necessary concessions, and the EU is hesitating. The EU has staked a certain amount of prestige on making a success of the world summit but, as is clear from the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, it has quite simply been insufficiently prepared. The EU must now, at the eleventh hour, go home and prepare itself. Hopefully, we shall have agreed, in as little as two weeks’ time in Seville, to take entirely practical initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">For Denmark, the world summit will be the first big international event of its EU Presidency and also a test of that presidency. Access to our markets is the key to the developing countries’ being able to compete successfully, but it is no use the EU’s making unduly strict demands of the developing countries as a condition of free trade, and they must certainly not be used as an excuse for the EU’s and the United States’s maintaining obstacles to trade. Determined work must be done on bringing the EU together in guaranteeing the world’s poorest countries access to the rich countries’ markets. The developing countries must be given a pledge of free and fair trade. As part of this, the EU must necessarily phase out export and production subsidies. As the country holding the presidency of the EU, Denmark should insist on all countries’ complying with the UN’s objective whereby 0.7% of Gross National Product is to be donated by way of aid to developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear to me that the whole of this preparatory process has been poorly organised, with poor leadership and, of course, a lack of political will on the part of the majority of players. What is most notable, I think, is the United States’s lack of interest in common solutions. This is in extreme contrast to the incredible pressure put on us by the United States precisely to seek common solutions in the fight against terrorism. I wonder why Washington does not see that these two issues are in some way interrelated.</p>
<p class="contents">After Bali, there is every reason to wonder what we are to do now. Four points strike me as being very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that the poor countries are looking for more aid, more support and better trade regulations, but I believe it is very important also to realise that more money alone will not lead to sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do – and I believe the EU can adopt a leading role in this area – is to review our own regulations. We must do away with subsidies that are harmful to the environment, ensure that market prices accurately reflect the full costs, and introduce norms and standards that necessarily make for greater efficiency in the way in which energy and materials are used.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also review policy in areas in which we know that we are at present, in actual fact, harming poor countries in particular. That applies to agricultural, trade and fisheries policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and as Mrs Wallström quite rightly pointed out, we must focus on a number of issues. If I were to choose just one of these, it would be the energy issue. We know that several billion people at present have no access to modern energy and, as long as that is the case, there can be no development. If, however, they were to obtain access to energy under conventional conditions, that would lead to major damage to the environment and climate. The EU will have to adopt a very radical and active approach in this area and ensure that we can develop forms of aid for solving this specific problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw attention to the core areas which, notably with the Cotonou Agreement, we have resolved to do something about, first among them being the war on poverty. That means seeing to basic services and health care, providing clean water for all, giving all children basic education, and, if possible, facilitating the participation of adults in educational programmes. Now that is not an end in itself, but rather something without which, in the final analysis, it is impossible to gain an understanding of the problems that affect every society and everyone's quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Those for whom every day is a struggle for survival are not readily going to be won over by lofty objectives. It is our responsibility to liberate them from the need to spend every day in search of food. It should be noted in this context that women have a key role to play in all development, and that there must be forceful demands made in Johannesburg for us to help put women in a position to take an active part in the process of development and actively contribute to the improvement of living conditions. All over the world, it is women who support development processes that lead to changes in civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the need to facilitate access to global communications in order to make social benefits possible.</p>

Over the past ten years, official development aid for nature and the environment even took a serious blow and there is hardly any evidence of good governance.

My question is to Commissioner Wallström: I know that the European Union was quite ambitious with regard to a specific objective concerning renewable energy. Perhaps you could tell us who is opposed to this and how we can make progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s lack of consistency over energy as well as farming subsidies is also regrettable. EUR 300 billion have now been allocated world-wide to nuclear and fossil fuels. If these subsidies were to be reduced, we would have substantial sums available to support investment in renewable energy and help the two billion people who do not have access to energy. I wonder if the position adopted by the European Union at Gothenburg to phase out energy subsidies still applies now.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, a word to the Spanish Presidency. If you put as much effort into helping countries that need help to develop enough to support their population as you are into building a wall around Europe, if you channelled this energy into becoming involved once again in the Johannesburg process, then I think your Presidency would be seen in a better light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, the Bali preparatory meeting has not only confirmed this but seems to have actually consolidated this sad observation. Johannesburg, therefore, is at risk of being a total failure, with extremely damaging consequences for the environment, for the poor countries and for the planet as a whole. We need only bear in mind that around one hundred items on the agenda have still not been agreed on, notably as a result of the intransigent and inflexible position of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this scenario, which we must counter, the issue we need to address today is what the position of the European Union and all the Member States will be; what position they will be adopting in the preparatory phase of the summit itself. And, crucially, whether they will fall in line with the unacceptable position of the United States, which is provocatively intransigent, if we consider the recent measures of agricultural protectionism they have adopted; or whether, instead, they will be prepared to follow on from the Rio Summit, both in the field of practical aid for development and for fighting poverty, and in terms of effectively protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The profound contradictions that became evident in Bali, and which must be overcome, require determination and clear and judicious proposals that do not link trade with development, which seems to be a consequence of the intention to end our own Development Council. Incidentally, I must say that Johannesburg cannot be seen simply as an extension of Doha and that these measures cannot, of course, consider the environment simply to be a business, as the United States claim. We must bear in mind that failure in Johannesburg will threaten the reasonable expectations raised in Rio. The European Union, therefore, has an obligation to commit itself wholeheartedly to adopting a constructive position and strategy, which are already long overdue, given that we only have a few weeks before the summit is to start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Bali meeting was disappointing and we do indeed have everything to fear for Johannesburg. A summit like this every ten years should enable us to achieve results, whether with regard to energy, water, economic development, or developing countries.We know what our mistakes are and yet we are not making any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The enthusiasm present at Kyoto has evaporated amid much disappointment. The rich countries are virtually at a standstill while the developing countries are floundering in their problems, their poverty, their lack of resources. My impression is that we are appeasing our consciences by talking about sustainable development, but that this is yet another hollow promise. We all have a responsibility to future generations, and this responsibility is incumbent upon all the States; it is incumbent upon the Member States of the European Union, which, however, only too often delay the implementation of their decisions indefinitely, for no real reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I also regret the attitude of the United States with regard to international commitments to safeguarding our planet. In the context of the fight against terrorism, the United States is asking for increased international cooperation. We are all in favour of developing this special relationship, and of this cooperation being included in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol too. American industry has declared itself to be in favour of this agreement. It knows that it would be a disadvantage in the long term to remain outside the system.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the United States, under the influence of this cooperation, to be able to take an active role in this fight against poverty, resource protection, energy development and climate change, following the example of Europe and, soon, I hope, Russia and Japan. Of course, it is up to the European Union to set ambitious objectives, but these must be attainable so that all the parties involved can find the necessary resources. Local communities should be given the right and the wherewithal to exercise power at their own level, and it would also be beneficial to encourage private initiatives and place more trust in civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to this event, it has already been said that the Union will have a delicate, difficult task. It is being called upon once again to show the leadership that it displayed in reinvigorating the Kyoto Protocol. In any case, the fight against climate change is indeed the first of the four priorities on which I believe we must focus at Johannesburg, working towards the conclusion of a binding political agreement<span class="bold"> </span>involving more countries than have already ratified the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is the right to water. In this area too we must work towards a binding agreement regulating bilateral and multilateral relations and establishing time frames and procedures for providing the billion people who are still without access to water with a minimum level of access to this resource too.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority item is biodiversity and, in particular, the minimum goal of stabilising the existing situation through an agreement ensuring that the world’s genetic heritage is shared by all.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and last priority, however, is political and institutional in nature: how to establish a United Nations body which has the power to intervene in, monitor and control international environmental undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that there are other major issues on which decisive progress needs to be made, but the real success of Johannesburg will be measured according to the progress made in the four areas I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every failure to reach agreement, such as this, sends out very negative signals. Action plans should focus on people because development can only be truly sustainable in its widest possible sense if it looks at people's needs but has respect for different languages and cultures as well as cultural values. There has to be partnership with developing countries and structures that respect democracy, human rights and good governance – new structures for global governance such as the World Environment Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have heard from the other speakers, there is general pessimism about the prospects of success at Johannesburg, so I would like to ask the Commission what the EU strategy in pursuit of sustainable development will be if Johannesburg does not deliver. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the leading donor of aid, the European Community must take this opportunity to play its rightful guiding role on the international stage – in the absence of the United States – contributing along with the other international institutions to the success of this event. However, its success will depend largely on achievable objectives being set. The recent undertaking to increase development aid will certainly be an important signal for the summit, but it is essential to establish a precise calendar and achievable deadlines without delay, together with an action plan which is realistic as well as ambitious. It will be crucial, for instance, to proceed along the path of debt cancellation, with due regard for human rights and the principles of good government, encouraging actions such as the adoption by the poor countries of a digitalised computerised complimentary<span class="bold"> </span>accounting model which will make their accounts transparent and reassure the European taxpayer.</p>

As she acknowledges, the European Union has a particular and important role to play: as a major donor of aid, as the biggest donor of humanitarian aid in the world and as the biggest trading block in the world. We have clout and we need to punch our weight in Johannesburg, but I acknowledge that it will be difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Market access is a key issue. President Museveni, after the Bali meeting, said that talk about sustainability is all very well but that market access is the most important issue. Ghana also challenged the European Union last week, saying that the Union talks about opening borders and about bringing down barriers, but is clearly protectionist and unfair. Ghana, of course, is talking about the high tariffs that have to be paid when an attempt is made to introduce processed coffee into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we preach about free trade when we continue to hand out subsidies to our farmers which artificially depress the prices of commodities such as cotton. We need coherence, we need consistency, we need to have an understanding of what self-reliance actually means, providing a ladder out of poverty, and we also need to understand about creating real global partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you need alliances in Johannesburg. The United States is blocking plans to halve the number of people who lack sanitation – two fifths of the population of the planet – while 2.4 billion do not have any sanitation, not even a bucket to use, in a world where that is one of the main causes of disease. Twenty five per cent of urban Africans have no piped water whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">The US position is always a very negative one, as it was when I was at the UN Children's Conference.

But what they wanted was essentially the money that was promised to them ten years ago, which was supposed to pay for the implementation of the Rio agreements agreed then. No wonder they have no faith in the North, which has not produced that money yet.</p>
<p class="contents">On trade, the Commissioner says that if Johannesburg focuses on trade issues we will lose the focus on sustainable development. The point is that you cannot separate trade and sustainable development. If people are to have secure access to water, we cannot pressure them into privatising their water supplies under the GATS agreement. If people are to have secure access to food, we cannot keep dumping agricultural products on their markets. It seems that it was agricultural subsidies in the EU that yet again broke one of the deals on the table. There is extraordinary hypocrisy in demanding subsidy reduction and neo-liberal economic policies in the South while practising old-fashioned northern protectionism in the North. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that Bali was the last opportunity to lay down a number of priorities, as well as a concrete and binding action plan. But traditional contradictions, such as the gap between North and South and the transatlantic tensions, have quashed these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it all started so promisingly. Ten years ago in Rio, the environment and development were combined for the first time. In addition, the need for sustainable development was recognised by all countries. But since then, little has happened with the results of Rio. The Kyoto Protocol took forever to be established and even now, it depends on Russia whether it will actually enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The US, the largest polluter, has rejected the Kyoto Protocol because it would harm the American economy, upon which Canada and Australia pulled out as well. Washington adopted the same attitude in Bali. It appears that the Bush administration does not want any binding agreements, but favours voluntary, noncommittal agreements from the private sector. However, global warming and the future of our planet are problems that are too serious to be left to the goodwill of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, what gives the US the right to make demands from developing countries if the US itself flouts all international agreements? It is clear that the transatlantic gap is becoming wider. Kyoto has illustrated that, based on short-sighted political considerations, the Bush administration deems America’s short-term interests more important than the well-being of future generations. The European Union, on the other hand, has assumed its responsibility in Kyoto and with it, has confirmed its moral leadership. I hope it will adopt the same consistent and decisive approach in Johannesburg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quarrels over diminishing but vital natural resources and decent living space may well be the cause of future conflicts or even wars. For this reason, natural resources must be brought under sustainable control and growth must be achieved without overexploitation of natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as has been said here, the Bali meeting was otherwise a disappointment in many ways. We are still looking for sufficient levels of commitment to respond to the challenges of the future. The European Union must also demand full commitment on the part of the Rio+ partners to take further steps forward. The United States of America and the other industrialised countries are obviously primarily responsible, but the European Union must build a bridge to the less developed countries too. It is the European Union that ultimately has to serve as the motor that will keep development running and help us achieve these much needed steps forward at the forthcoming meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union to be adequately effective, however, it must be strong internally. Consequently, all the institutions must speak with one voice. In two weeks’ time in Seville we shall have the chance to do just this and make the European voice heard. By the same token, we have to make sure that the European Parliament is effectively involved in the preparation process and coordination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty-eight million people are living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, of whom 2.3 million died of AIDS last year. These figures are telling and are all too well-known.</p>

<p class="contents">In the ten years between Rio and Johannesburg, there has been a fundamental change towards a globalised society in which social and economic inequalities seem closely linked to environmental problems and governability in all countries. The eradication of poverty is becoming a priority objective in the world because it is the only way we can guarantee security, governance and equality in a globalised world.</p>
<p class="contents">After almost thirty years of policies aimed at reconciling economic development, the environment and social well-being, I believe that we have a pretty good knowledge of the range of instruments and measures to be applied in order to achieved balanced growth in a globalised world: transparency and openness of the markets, management of knowledge and innovation, transfer of technologies, the efficiency of our processes and products, the acceptance and application of social and environmental responsibility in all sectors; these are some of the most important measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to approach Johannesburg by strengthening the coalition between government, civil society and the production sector, in order to jointly deal with the main challenges of global sustainability and equality. The European Union has offered clear signs of its desire to lead this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in Johannesburg we will be able – and I include the delegation from the European Parliament here – to defend brave, generous and worthy positions which will show us to be what we aspire to be: leaders in the new world order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What Commissioner Wallström correctly called a stand-off in her speech this afternoon will not be solved unless the European Union visibly shifts its position towards that of developing countries. Compromise, yes, but not a compromise which demands increasing environmental goals from the developing countries without offering them trade and economic gains at the same time. Sustainable development includes development and where is the commitment to that in the EU's position?</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the limited promises made by the Commissioner this afternoon as regards seeking the extension of the "Everything but Arms" initiative worldwide, and also by the Spanish Presidency on the Tobin tax and other potential new sources of public finance for development. But I share colleagues' view that there is no point in agreeing a commitment to eliminate child labour and then relying on exclusively voluntary agreements with business to achieve this and other legitimate development goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind the Council and Commission that two weeks ago this Parliament voted for mandatory social and environmental reporting by European enterprises on their global supply chain, as a first step towards establishing a binding framework for corporate accountability. I ask you to lead that argument in Johannesburg too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, compromise with the US is one thing. Allowing the US to exercise a veto on agreement is another. Today we are left with an implementation plan with no less than 200 sets of brackets representing unresolved issues. Without stronger leadership from the EU, there can and will be no final agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, resistance to it is now becoming a reality and national and commercial interests are clearly coming into view. It is more important than ever for the EU to be able to strengthen its partnerships with third countries and other blocs.</p>
<p class="contents">To its credit, the Union has especially dedicated itself to slowing down and preventing climate change. The information necessary for this is still limited, though sufficient to state that there no longer exists any scientific uncertainty that human beings are causing the earth’s climate to become warmer. Our prominent role, however, means the data we have needs to be coordinated and explored more fully. For that reason I want, prior to the meeting at Johannesburg, to propose that the EU should establish a special European Climate Change Agency, whose job it would be to support the Community in policy concerning climatic change. Right now this would be an important signal politically. The EU must acquire firm scientific support for its work, for example, in matters to do with trade, as our major competitor, the United States of America, is not intending to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be the task of the European Climate Change Agency to compile data on climatic change and its impact on the environment, the economy and society. The Agency would have to produce and commission studies and evaluate existing data, and thus act as the much-needed link between scientific research and the political decision-makers. All this is necessary for the EU’s policy of sustainable development to gain strength and for the EU to hone its role as international leader. By acting on the best available information the EU can build international partnerships in which selfish national and financial ambitions can be constructively thwarted.</p>
<p class="contents">Climatic change is the most serious problem in our history and its most serious threat. It would be only reasonable to see it also taken seriously in connection with the use of EU resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Miguel,</span></span>   Council. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I think that this debate has been extraordinarily informative because many things have been said, but they are all things that both the Council and the Commission have fully accepted, because we totally share the widespread disappointment felt by everyone at the outcome of the Bali conference and the concern at the almost insurmountable difficulties facing preparations for the Johannesburg conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should not like to end this debate on a negative note, having mentioned all the injustices inherent in the distribution of poverty in the world and the enormous problems of world trade and environmental problems and not state that Europe has the capacity for leadership. I believe the fact that the European Parliament shares this concern inspires the Commission and the Council, who are responsible for representing the position of Europe and its leadership in all these issues that are so close to us and, naturally, so close to our hearts, because they have a major impact on the conscience of European public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that, despite the fact that the outcome of the Bali conference was not very positive, some very important goals and agreements have been achieved during these months of the Spanish Presidency, which have confirmed that the European Union is moving in the right direction. Let us remember that the European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol at the beginning of March. Let us also remember that we achieved a compromise in Monterrey, against all predictions, committing ourselves to providing development aid; let us also remember that the European Union has, throughout recent years, maintained its leadership in development aid and in defending courageous policies on trade with developing countries such as the 'Everything but arms' directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, therefore, have experience and we are fighting for the right idea which, of course, I believe we all share – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – and which is that we have to make an effort to make the world in which we live a better place. This is a very complex world, however, in which, as all honourable Members who have spoken know because you have, of course, considerable knowledge of the dialectic at stake at the moment with regard to Johannesburg, there are great interests and enormous amounts of national self-interest, not only in the developed world, but also in other blocs of countries that have adopted radical positions and which often prevent consensus being reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Our thesis has to date consisted of considering that it is better to have a global agreement, even if it is relatively ambitious, than to have no agreement at all. This is the very reason we were not able to achieve anything positive in Bali but, nevertheless, our desire to conclude an agreement remains intact. This week the Committee of Permanent Representatives is debating a set of initiatives that the General Affairs Council will consider on Monday 17 June, and which will become guidelines with which the Seville European Council will continue negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, for his part, the President of the Council intends to take this issue to the highest level at the G8 Summit in Kananaskis, in Alberta, Canada, which will take place at the end of June. The Spanish Presidency will keep up the pressure to the end and the Danish Presidency is also already prepared to take over on 1 July.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I believe that we should not be discouraged by the fact that Bali has been a disappointment for us all; all is not lost and much can still be achieved. I also genuinely believe that the Council, together with the Commission, is capable of maintaining its position of leadership; that the Seville European Council will send a clear message to the world about our position and our commitment to the<span class="italic"> </span>Johannesburg objectives. Similarly, we will also be working with our partners, particularly within the G8; we still have almost three months before Johannesburg opens and we hope we have sufficient experience to be able to impose, with our strength and our leadership, a solution that is acceptable to everyone in that South African city at the beginning of September.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want Johannesburg, as I have said, to be a further disappointment of the type we saw in Durban and we are, therefore, willing to work on this and are doing so with the satisfaction and the relief that we enjoy the political support of this Parliament that has been expressed so forcefully in today’s sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves of the difficult position from which we are in actual fact starting, with, first of all, a quite different political climate than that which prevailed when the Rio Summit took place. Now, we are living in a much more polarised world. The fight against terrorism and the Axis of Evil has meant that the mood in the G77 Group naturally feels completely different.</p>
<p class="contents">Expectations of the Bali Summit were incredibly high. There was a very long wish-list covering every political area imaginable, and a poorly focused political agenda. Against that background, it is important not to ignore what has been achieved. We had a whole range of colleagues working very hard to ensure, in fact, that we could ‘clear the decks’ and agree on as much as possible in the action plan. There is also a great deal which has been achieved and on which we have reached decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we forget the negotiations on climate change, which also collapsed at a certain phase but which could be resumed and made to yield a satisfactory result.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hardly surprising that the poor countries are complaining and demanding more of us now, for the experiences in Rio were alarming. The money needed to pay for the thousands of recommendations decided upon in Rio was never forthcoming. That is why there has been such poor implementation of all these recommendations. It is therefore very important that we now prepare ourselves for our role as bridge builders. I can imagine our having to play that role very actively in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take more practical measures in precisely those areas mentioned here in the debate. In spite of everything, none of this is news to the Commission or the Council. These are areas which we have already discussed and in which we have already done some preparation, but we need to see what progress we can make when it comes to grants, trade, access to our markets and development aid. We need to describe still more clearly the practical objectives we have put forward with regard, for example, to water and energy issues. Perhaps we need to supplement our descriptions with calculations of costs and to demonstrate how we are to achieve our objectives successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">There is naturally opposition from those who do not wish to go beyond the objectives of the millennium declaration and who do not want to draw up practical timetables, deadlines and practical objectives expressed, for example, in terms of years.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that we can preserve the status of environmental issues in the debate. We need to rescue the whole concept of ‘sustainable development’. I naturally appreciate how important it is to link it to trade and development issues and issues of funding, but it is also important to safeguard the whole idea of our being concerned here with a single whole. It is a question of seeing the whole picture, in which environmental, as well as economic and social, issues have their place.</p>
<p class="contents">What, finally, will happen if Johannesburg fails? These are not, of course, issues under which it will be possible to draw a line in Johannesburg. The objectives we draw up for the European Union are ones which, after Johannesburg too, we shall of course have to comply with and continue to work on. Possible failure there should not prevent us from finalising and implementing the plans we have jointly decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank you again for this important debate. In our preparations, we shall bear in mind everything that was said. I hope that we can count on the support of the European Parliament and that we shall also, hopefully, be able in as active a way as possible to employ the European Parliament’s delegation in the preparations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
