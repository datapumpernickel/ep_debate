<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why is innovation so important for the European Union? We can all see that we are having slight problems with the economy at the moment. If we want the economic situation to improve again, we must take initiatives to get employment rising again, take initiatives to get unemployment to fall, and take initiatives to ensure our continuing prosperity in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we also need to be able to assess that objectively. That is why we should use benchmarking. I am very grateful to the Commissioner for putting the innovation scoreboard very much to the fore here, too, because it enables us to see very clearly how the various countries are performing. And, of course, the method of best practice: to see where among our neighbours of the Fifteen in Europe they are working better than in our own countries. That is how it always was for me at school: you can learn from your better classmates. And we shouldn’t just stick to Europe, but we should also be looking in particular at the countries that aspire to join us, to see what they are already doing better than we do. There is an enormous amount of knowledge, a great deal of capacity for innovation, in the technical departments of our universities, as there is of course also in America, Japan, India and many other countries, from which we could benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation must not take place only in the economy, but also in the social, cultural and above all the political fields. We would very much like to see publicly sponsored research corrected to make it in future even more geared to the market or, it would perhaps be better to say, to the citizen. Where in future will we find services or products that the citizen would like, that he needs? Such market research will be very important for us in future if we are to see where our innovation policy needs to be focused.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation also means repeatedly taking risks, however. We therefore need to ensure that the necessary venture capital is available. It is especially when times are getting hard that funding runs short. We all know that Basle II will perhaps bring a further restriction here, too, especially for smaller firms. Nevertheless – and I would like to correct the text here – we have 18 million SMEs in Europe with fewer than 250 workers. We need to pay particular attention to them, since after all they generate 80% of the tax yield and employ two thirds of the workforce. Innovation must start in the small units. We need subjective innovation; that means combining familiar techniques and technologies, extending them, rethinking where they can be used and where they can be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the central points is of course life-long on-going and vocational training. Continuing training schemes are becoming increasingly important, and we should therefore also concentrate on the best ways of passing on knowledge. By <span class="italic">e</span>-learning – to use the general term – but much more, I believe, by e-<span class="italic">e</span>ntertainment. Learning should be fun, learning should be interesting, learning should make you curious, but learning should also be an adventure. We ought in future to provide an experience primarily with a European content, putting our European values, our European knowledge at centre stage on the Internet and in our education and learning programmes as well as being ready to engage in international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need new systems in schools, however. We need new methods of quality management for teachers and pupils. ISO 9000 is already taken for granted in firms. It seems to me that these new procedural techniques could also be used to make appreciable progress in schools. But enterprises also need easier access to funding. We need people to start new businesses and the mentality to start new businesses, and we need to make it easier for businesses to pass from one generation to the next. Tax concessions need to be offered and venture capital made available, because the life cycle of a business goes: founded, handed over and finally closed. We need to give thought to all three phases in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we need it not just to serve the economy, the knowledge-driven economy in today's society, we also need it to serve the knowledge-driven and cultural society. Because innovation is not just an economic and business factor, it is also an educational and cultural factor. More to the point, it is the result of mutual and complex actions and reactions between education, research, the administration and the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovative procedures presuppose a dynamic social model which is receptive to change. In fact, innovation does not depend solely or exclusively on technological factors, it also depends on organisational factors. A propitious environment is the main requirement, so that new initiatives, new discoveries and scientific applications can be developed, which is why we need social components working together, we need close cooperation between businesses and scientific institutions, as well as schools and universities, and we also need the help of the media if an innovative culture is to mature in our society as a whole. Innovation must be the property of every member of society. That is how our society will work in new directions, opening up new paths.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs an approach to innovation which will directly serve society as a whole. However, we know that there are quite a few negative structural factors which prevent us from progressing as far as we should. We are quite a way behind and I think that this is a bitter but honest admission, which is why we need the measures proposed in the report, together with suitable educational systems that nurture innovation. Innovation is a process of analysis and synthesis and young people – mainly students – need therefore to play a part. We must take care to ensure that we do not just inflict talk and chalk on young people and that they take an active part in the innovative process during their studies and both inside and outside school.</p>
<p class="contents">We must cultivate this approach at all levels of education. It is important to have cross-disciplinary syllabuses in tertiary education. We must bring the exact and the theoretical sciences close together, however difficult that may seem. We must also understand that we need better penetration of university research institutes and of scientific libraries via the Internet. I should like to highlight this sector in particular, because we are still a long way from having the really efficient network of libraries in Europe that is an absolute must.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should take steps to provide better protection for intellectual property because this is what can invigorate and foster the incentive for our scientists to innovate. That is why it is also extremely important for us to promote the application of European patent law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union was to become the most dynamic and the most competitive economic area in the world. Innovation is the key to this. It is the subject of an excellent report by Mr Rübig, whom I would expressly like to congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. His report is thorough and precise; it is creative and full of insights.</p>
<p class="contents">Only an innovation offensive will create the necessary conditions for making up the ground we have lost to the USA and Japan, preventing a mass exodus of researchers and finally achieving international competitiveness. Specifically, it means changing our systems of education. Young people must be able to be involved at an early stage, by teaching them science in schools and specifically encouraging their talents. Curricula must include projects modelled on professional management, by forming junior enterprises, for example. We need new information systems and higher technological qualifications in the training and further training of workers and students.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig has always been concerned with revitalising small and medium-sized enterprises. His particular concern is important given that we have 18 million SMEs. Workers are specifically asking for programmes to promote SMEs in the European Union because over 70 to 80 % work in that sector. SMEs need simpler tax procedures, a dismantling of bureaucratic hurdles, and active support for innovative products and methods of production. Research needs to be integrated into operating structures. Access to start-up capital is essential, because young people need to be able to start new businesses, to become entrepreneurs. They need to be able to take all the current problems of the new economy<span class="italic"> </span>into account. I hope we have all learned something from that.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, Madam President, the European Union will be able to make a sustained contribution to the high performance, knowledge-driven economy we are looking to achieve.</p>

The Commission's document is also commendable, and makes enjoyable reading. So, now innovation is to form the basis for know-how – a knowledge-driven economy. While <span class="italic">e</span>Europe was still at the discussion stage, we were in an information-based economy, and so we learned to perfect ourselves all the time like candidates in a beauty contest. The next stage is of course the civilised society to which we all, whether engineers or singing teachers, are striving.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is true that bureaucracy is one barrier in this work of innovation; we ought to have programmes which act like fast lanes for innovations – this is the first requirement. Secondly, creating a creative and rewarding atmosphere is of the essence, and this will be difficult. Thirdly, the operational programme should incorporate aid specifically to innovative firms or corporations in the SME sector, since – as already stated – 80 percent of taxes and 60 percent of jobs come from this sector. Fourthly, protection of the creative input of employees must be up to scratch, so that barriers to such input do not arise, and the same goes for reward. Allow me once again to repeat that this creative leadership is very important, and it is not very common. Creative leadership demands – within firms as elsewhere – equality, trust and fairness. It would also be a good idea to set up ‘innovation banks’, from which firms and other players could purchase and acquire innovations for practical application, and to which inventors and innovators could transfer them. Such activity would be one way to accelerate the exploitation of innovations, and would create this type of good and rational framework<span class="italic">.</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of the seventeen million companies in Europe, no fewer than 99 percent form part of the medium-sized and small business sector. That accounts for more than 70 percent of employment, 50 percent of investment and 60 percent of the Union’s wealth. As such, the medium-sized and small businesses are the most important economic factor in the European economy. The competitiveness of these businesses very much relies on their innovative capacity. At the moment, Parliament is working hard on the Sixth Framework Programme, in which the participation of SMEs must be guaranteed at the same – or, ideally, a higher – level. I have therefore proposed to increase the budget available to SMEs to 15 percent from the current 10 percent. But that participation of SMEs must, in the view of the Liberal Group, take place within themed programmes. Indeed, in that way, it is guaranteed that large and small companies will join forces, for small companies do not have the expertise and manpower to go it alone. It is not acceptable for most of the limited research budget that is available to be spent on the flanking policy in the Member States, for that is not a European task.</p>
<p class="contents">It is more important to simplify the participation of medium-sized and small businesses in the Sixth Framework Programme. That is why the ‘rules of participation’ must be simplified and standardised so that research applications submitted by all Directorates-General for the Sixth Framework Programme as a whole can be dealt with more efficiently and more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by giving you some food for thought: Europe is good at converting euros into research, but often fails in converting research into euros, and that must change in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report calls for the networks to be strengthened at European level. This dissemination of gathered knowledge should not lead to less competition, which is another aspect of innovation, for what are the areas in which cooperation actually reinforces the ability to innovate?</p>
<p class="contents">Tax benefits are in any case not a very good incentive. They fragment the market and can lead to a shift in activities to the cheapest region. Market-oriented attraction is preferable.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also underlines the importance of education. This is an area in which only the Member States have authority. In this connection, it is not the international orientation or the mobility of education and research itself, but the results, that deserve recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">National initiatives promoting the innovative environment and acknowledging achievements will have to increase competitiveness. The aspects that make European regions into an attractive environment in terms of innovation are the knowledge available, the labour market and other local factors. A government should therefore have a vision of regional profiles it would like in future. However, regional specialisms can be adversely affected either by tax measures or by uniform measures which are said to result in a loss of quality for Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is typified – more so than the report – by a realistic approach from the bottom upwards. If necessary, a joint approach could play an additional role to promote networks. In that way, the Union can back the measures which increase the Member States’ ability to innovate, both individually and jointly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ambitious objectives of Lisbon also threaten to remain so much rhetoric, and will perish like worldly honour, if the success of the European Union in global competition is not based on a high level of education and research.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several aspects relating to a comprehensive innovation policy, which many colleagues have already emphasised in their interventions. As European legislators, we should pay particular attention to simplifying legislation and administration. I subscribe to the view of Mr Rübig and of other colleagues, that simplification is a necessity. Enterprise and development activity is excessively restricted by bureaucratic impediments, and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular suffer from this. Besides some form of labour reform, we also need a complete administrative reform, which has already got off to a good start with the White Paper on administrative models.</p>
<p class="contents">As you, yourself, said a couple of days ago, our esteemed competitors the United States and Japan are further along the road of promoting and developing innovations than the EU; one of the reasons for this is that in those countries enterprise and risk-taking are rewarded to a significantly greater degree than in Europe. We must create conditions which encourage self-starting and independent initiative. Enterprise can be promoted early among schoolchildren and students. All we need to do is to create the prerequisite conditions in our education systems, for example, in the form of a special business model which young businesses can then adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regard the development of human capital as important. It is a significant factor in innovation. A genuine information society must be within the reach of all citizens, and so raising the level of know-how of the entire population is important. The copyright of innovations must also be better protected; this has already been mentioned in other interventions. Even before this, in the course of my work I have stressed the importance of adopting a Community Patent which will cover the entire area of the European Union. The Community Patent would offer complete Union-wide protection for new patents, at the same time significantly reducing the administrative costs of firms.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">And last but not least:</span> we need a revolution in thinking which would free us from orthodox thinking and modes of action. We must create conditions which make it possible to produce a whole raft of new ideas, out of which we may perhaps develop that one breakthrough innovation. New technology is not the key to a good future; we need non-conventional thinking in all fields, in firms as well as in public administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that very reason, I hope I may be allowed to question some of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been discussing why innovation is so important for the European Union. The rapporteur has given a broad answer to that question. We could of course ask him what innovation? What innovation is most in demand at the moment? Perhaps military technology so we can find Osama bin Laden quickly. Is that the kind of innovation we mean? Is it innovation in surveillance that will enable us to uncover sleepers in the future? Or do we not need to define innovation? With our European system of values, are we not concerned here with innovation in education, innovation in social learning? And how will we get there? Would it not be an innovation finally to know how much is spent on innovation? Do you know, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to find out how much is invested in the future in a big country like the Federal Republic of Germany. We know what is spent on administration, we know what is invested in transfer payments, but when it comes to investing in the future, nobody knows. We all agree that there cannot be too much funding for investment, because that is really the only way to safeguard the future. But the question is, what kind of a future? Where are we heading? And is not the time after 11 September actually an ideal time to question much that was simply only a fixation with technology and instead to initiate research into social innovation? Has the time not now also come to free ourselves from old instruments like gross national product and bring the innovative instrument of a well being factor more into the centre?</p>
<p class="contents">Questions on a good report. Nevertheless, once again congratulations, Paul!</p>

<p class="contents">However, the importance of innovation to our economic and social development needs to be appreciated more both by the Member States and by the European Commission itself. Delays in implementing innovative measures under the Structural Funds and the cancellation of resources are sad proof of the fact that innovation often gets no further than the drawing board. So we need a decisive and coordinated policy which ensures that innovation penetrates our entire economic and social fabric and that our citizens' creative powers are give free rein.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to highlight the fact that this policy needs to be driven by the principle of equal opportunities. For a start, I do not believe that innovation is the duty or preserve of the young, I believe it should affect all ages with lifelong learning and the other methods mentioned by previous speakers. I would like to point out that we need to encourage women in their individual and collective efforts, such as setting up companies, and we need to encourage women's non-governmental organisations to take an innovative approach to social activities which have a positive impact on social cohesion and job creation. Equal opportunities should also apply geographically, given the huge discrepancies between the regions of the European Union when it comes to innovation. Both the European Union and the Member States should pay special attention to disadvantaged regions, which are usually the mountain and island areas of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With the lack of innovation in Europe compared with the United States and Japan, we need to get moving and mobilise our forces. This means that the spirit of innovation must also drive the European Union's innovation management policy. Special units, such as the unit set up to manage innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, are a step in the right direction, they just need to be adequately staffed to make them effective. The European Commission must also focus on disseminating the results of best practices, which is why pioneering methods need to be found, with much better penetration and efficiency than those available under past policies and both the Member States of the European Union and candidate countries must work with the European Union and take appropriate steps to disseminate best practices and adopt all the new models which account for the performance of the best countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is widely recognised that policies that foster innovation are an underlying determinant of economic growth. I am particularly happy to present to you today the very latest findings of the EU’s innovation policy performance, namely the 2001 Innovation Scoreboard, which was compiled as a follow-up to the report last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2001 European Innovation Scoreboard gives us a starting point for the Union’s strategy to enhance its overall competitiveness, by providing a common measure of a country's performance using 17 indicators. I would also like to say that I share the rapporteur’s opinion in underlining the importance of education and training, something that has been noted by other speakers. One indicator called for in the report was added to the scoreboard to cover lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">EU performance in terms of growth and the standard of living relative to the US and Japan highlights the key challenges that the EU faces in enhancing its competitiveness. In the past twenty-five years, and apart from temporary cyclical fluctuations, the EU has not kept pace with the US in improving its standard of living. The gap is now wider than it was a quarter of a century ago. At the aggregate level, the gap in living standards can be attributed to two factors: two-thirds to the employment rate, which is lower, and one-third to productivity. I will focus on the productivity gap.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the mid-1990s, the productivity gap between the EU and the US narrowed steadily. In the second half of the 1990s, however, the rapid acceleration of productivity growth in the US again began to widen the gap. Until the early 1990s, capital-intensive industries spearheaded productivity growth. This changed in the mid-1990s, when research and innovation became the key determinants. The industries that achieved the greatest productivity gains during the late 1990s were predominantly research-intensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall strategy for boosting competitiveness requires us to better combine Union and Member State efforts to develop more effective policies to foster and support innovation. National innovation policies should be reinforced, developed, and take a more consistent approach across the EU. This is why we need a regular benchmarking exercise to measure and compare the performance of EU countries, identify key areas of weakness and strength, and enable ourselves to design and fine-tune innovation policies accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the EU as a whole, we still lag behind the US and Japan on most indicators. We trail significantly in terms of private-sector investment in research and development. Rapid increases in business research and development in Japan and the US since 1994 have widened the gap with Europe alarmingly. US expenditure in this area is now 74% higher than in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s high-tech patenting activity is also too weak: US businesses apply for more high-technology patents in Europe than do European businesses. Japanese patenting in Europe is almost as strong as US patenting. This patenting imbalance is an area that requires urgent attention. At individual Member State level, the picture is different. I must say that, as regards many indicators, the best-performing EU countries are also world leaders, sometimes doing substantially better than the US and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you some examples: the UK, Ireland and France, for example, are world-leading suppliers of science and engineering graduates; the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark are ahead in home Internet access; Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden lead in public research and development; and Sweden is well ahead in business research and development expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, differences in innovation performance between Member States are still significant. Countries such as Denmark and Finland, whose performance was already strong, continue to lead the field when measured by the innovation index, that is to say in terms of trends, not scoreboards alone. Greece and Spain are rapidly catching up with the EU average, while starting from a relatively low base. But change is important and positive. The four largest EU economies (France, Germany, the UK and Italy) are improving, but at rates below the EU average.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of lessons can be drawn from these results. The Union should: first, invest in education and training, as has been said here a few times; second, improve its performance in the high-tech sectors and promote entrepreneurship; third, help to step up business research and development by encouraging Member States to introduce or increase the necessary incentives; and finally, promote the use of technologies in all sectors of the economy, including public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that several of these aspects are well covered by Mr Rübig’s report. I believe this report will help to generate a consensus on the way forward. This is necessary, as shown by the findings of the Innovation Scoreboard. The report expresses Europe’s wish to reduce the Union’s innovation deficit and achieve the goal set at Lisbon and, hence, does a great deal to help improve the EU’s overall competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that there will be an opportunity to come back to these issues in the Commission’s 2001 Competitiveness Report, which will be presented in a few weeks' time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
