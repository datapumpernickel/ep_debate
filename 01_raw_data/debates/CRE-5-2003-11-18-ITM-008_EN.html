<p class="contents">Fighting cancer has been one of the Commission’s major public health priorities. Each year cancer is diagnosed in about 1.6 million Europeans and kills around 950 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">Estimates suggest, however, that the lives of about 75 000 Europeans could be saved annually if best practices of cancer screening were made available to all citizens across the European Union. Even more lives could be saved by extending these recommendations to the acceding countries. The Commission’s proposal for a recommendation on cancer screening and Mr Mussa’s report show a clear sign of shared commitment to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this proposal is to make recommendations for mass screening programmes on a sound scientific basis. It aims to achieve further reductions of cancer-specific mortality in all Member States by establishing general principles of best practice, as recommended by cancer experts.</p>
<p class="contents">In addressing these questions, we must however remember that the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care fall under the competence of the Member States. That is why the Commission’s proposal addresses the issue through a Council recommendation. However, I should stress that these issues are essential preconditions for the success of any screening programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal foresees a report on the implementation of cancer screening programmes, on the basis of information to be provided by Member States, no later than the end of the third year after the date of its adoption. This report will be used to consider the need for further action.</p>
<p class="contents">In the follow-up the Commission will take a particular interest in the two main areas of the scientific developments. First, the new tests which would improve or possibly even replace recommended methods, such as combining the pap test with testing for infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses or in other words, HPV testing, and, second, the new tests for cancers in other organs, such as PSA testing for prostate cancer.</p>

As I have already had the opportunity to reiterate on other occasions, I believe that public health should increasingly be treated as a matter of primary importance in European policies, not least in view of the forthcoming enlargement. This recommendation is the first step towards the harmonisation and coordination of policies regarding the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, cancer is the main cause of death in industrialised countries, affecting patients, families and operators themselves. The socio-economic impact is therefore enormous, not just in terms of the cost of treating and supporting patients but also in terms of the emotional strain involved. In addition to the human tragedy, the situation causes a continual decrease in the proportion of the healthy population whose productivity and know-how are the mainstay of European society. We can deduce from the most recent statistics that the average age of onset of these diseases is getting lower and lower: the younger the patient, the more aggressive the disease. Thus, the possibility of treating cancer undeniably depends on how early it is diagnosed; besides, late diagnosis of cancer requires aggressive and invasive forms of treatment, which are costly and have a high psychological and social impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Member States are responsible for health policies, through their national health systems, it is unthinkable that such an important prevention campaign, in both the social and public health spheres, should remain a national or regional project dependent on the economic and cultural potential of each country. The impact of this disease on society should be borne and coordinated at European level, guaranteeing equal opportunities for treatment and therefore good results across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">The current capacity for radical treatment in oncology seems to depend more on the opportunities for prevention, based on epidemiological and etiopathogenetic knowledge and early diagnosis, rather than on surgical techniques and radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. For example, we might take the example of gastric carcinoma, for which the five-year survival rate ranges between 95% in patients with an intramucosal carcinoma to less than 10% in patients with an advanced invasive carcinoma, despite therapy. On the one hand, a correct and adequate screening needs a maximum capacity for identifying even the smallest lesions (sensitivity) and a good capacity for distinguishing them from benign lesions (specificity) and to ensure that the diagnostic investigation is non-invasive for the patient and itself entails an almost zero risk of damage, since the procedures are, by definition, carried out on asymptomatic individuals, who are only potentially ill. Of course, the new instruments for early diagnosis, before being offered at European level, should be examined and validated carefully by means of trials. Last but not least, the excellence of ‘good practice’ in screening should be checked by analysing the mortality figures collected in all Member States and preferably entered in a European databank.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial resources must be mobilised to increase the number of diagnostic centres and ensure that the workload entailed in screening does not jeopardise the quality of the testing or increase waiting times, which would lead to a deterioration in the quality of care for patients already suffering from cancer. It is therefore essential that European action is organised on four fronts: firstly, information and health education for European citizens; secondly, carrying out forms of screening which have already proven their worth; thirdly, periodic checks on the quality of screening; fourthly, research into the applicability of new screening methods. This recommendation will allow Europe to take unified action against what is a widespread, cruel and socially destructive disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgent need for strategic action to combat cancer at European level is demonstrated by the alarming etiological fact that one European in four has or will have a malignant tumour in the course of their lives. Finally, in addition to European-level screening there ought to be guidelines for the treatment of diseases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that. That is why I very much welcome the Commission’s initiative in recommending to the Member States that they introduce screening, the need for which is confirmed by scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as absolutely scandalous that, for example, only eight Member States have to date started to offer national programmes for mammography screening to all, even though, according to WHO, this cuts the mortality rate by up to 36%, and even though the quality guidelines for this were presented as long ago as 1992. Commissioner, I regret that I cannot avoid issuing what is both an appeal and a warning. If we are to really take this Council recommendation seriously, you cannot at the same time allow all the screening networks to be forced to close down their operations. At the end of the day, it was the work of the European Cancer Networks that led to this Council recommendation. If you, the Commission, want to have real credibility in the fight against cancer, then you have to find a permanent place for screening in the new action programme on health. We must not allow a recurrence of what happened this year, when the word ‘cancer’ no longer appeared in the action programme’s work plan, which – as you know all too well – eventually, and inevitably, resulted in support for all the screening networks being discontinued.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we will still, in future, need the European networks to draw up new guidelines and improve existing ones, for only by these means will we achieve equally high standards of screening across the EU. In addition, though, we need the networks to support the new Member States, where, as is well known, action is even more urgently needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The figures speak for themselves. One in four people in Europe dies of cancer. The suffering caused is enormous, not only for those hit by the disease, but also for their families and friends. As terrible as cancer is, however, it is possible to survive it. That does mean, however, that the disease must be detected very early, since that leads to a considerable reduction in the number of deaths from it. It has been demonstrated that there is a link with the screening programmes, and that is why it is so important for us MEPs, too, to hold detailed discussions on reports such as this, based on sound data supplied by the Commission. I must also compliment the Commission on the report it presented. I should actually recommend that the Commission circulate that report widely. It should be compulsory reading for all policy-makers, because it reveals that preventive action saves lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has an enormous task ahead of it. We must ensure that the available expertise is not wasted. I therefore concur with Mrs Jöns’s words a moment ago on the cancer networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also keep innovating. That means that we must not just persist with old, classical tests. Combining a number of things that, according to this report, have been proved or are currently being proved, will enable us to do a much better job. I am thinking of not only the HPV test, but also the test for prostate cancer in Luxembourg and the test for colon cancer. Given that we also still have a European research programme, of which health forms a major part, we can do a good deal more for European citizens, particularly if the Commissioner and all of us really put this at the heart of our policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone knows somebody, either directly or indirectly, who has been or is being affected by cancer. One in four Europeans will die of cancer. Among men, lung and stomach cancer are the most common cancers worldwide, and for women the most common cancers are breast and cervical cancers.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are going to tackle one of the biggest causes of death in the EU and the world, cancer screening is a critical tool in our battle against the disease. According to the World Health Organisation, we know enough about the causes of cancer to prevent at least one third of all cancers, cancers that are largely preventable by stopping smoking, eating healthy food and avoiding exposure to carcinogens. For those who are affected, detection is critical and screening is essential. The earlier cancer is detected, the better the survival rate.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to have mammography screening for breast cancer for women aged 50 to 69, faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer in men and women aged 50 to 74 and pap smear tests for cervical abnormalities between the ages of 20 and 30 are steps in the right direction in securing the health of Europeans and they should be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">As Amendment 33 suggests, we need to look at the promising new screening tests currently under evaluation, especially the HPV test and a test for prostate cancer, as well as considering mammography screening for women aged 40 to 49.</p>
<p class="contents">We must rely on clinical evidence and evaluation to back up recommendations for the acceptance of new tests. Sadly, although I am supportive of HPV tests, I cannot support Amendment 34. As soon as the tests are complete, I look forward to us recommending the full inclusion of this process in screening tests. However, screening cannot be seen in isolation. Cancer networks and cancer registries are also vital in monitoring the impact of screening the population and changes in incidence and survival and mortality.</p>
<p class="contents">Public education and information are essential. If you look on the Internet and type the word cancer, you will get 18 600 000 hits. E-health and communication are essential in the world that we live in.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the recommendation before us today will help us in the battle against cancer. Too many people in Scotland, Britain, the EU and the world, die from this disease. We must do all we can to detect, treat and care for people with cancer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have before us today is a recommendation. Of course, we know its limits, but this cannot stop us from being ambitious, I have said it and clearly too. This, I believe, is what we are endeavouring to do in the committee and I would like to stress briefly the main points that were improved on the original text.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, lowering the recommended age for mammography screening for breast cancer from 50 to 40, was, I would say, obvious in light of the statistics on prevalence and current practice in several Member States. Then, combining the cervical smear (pap test) with the HPV test to detect cervical cancer. This is a crucial addition since human papilloma virus kills 12 800 women every year in Europe. Figures published by experts show that the introduction of the HPV test would help to reduce this number of deaths by at least a third. Allow me, in passing, to commend the Czech Republic because this accession State is the only State in Europe that currently reimburses for this test. Thirdly, and we are now moving on to the male population, the introduction of screening for prostate cancer with the PSA test. This is also a matter of urgency: prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men and the second cause of death after lung cancer. It can be permanently cured if it remains localised in the prostate. This blood test is very simple, routine and should be recommended from the age of 50 years in our text.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also just like to say how important it is that everyone, including the less well informed, has access to screening, which is why I wanted to recommend mobile screening campaigns here. It is also in this same general mindset of informing the public that I would like to conclude by stressing, over and above the precise recommendation and before screening, the importance of primary prevention when talking about cancer. Health education, diet, the fight against smoking, sport, moderate exposure to the sun, like many measures at national level and behaviour at an individual level, will enable us to prevent these avoidable cancers from developing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Screening is therefore vital, in particular for people exposed to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances. Equality of access to screening programmes also needs to be guaranteed for all. To this end, awareness campaigns, which seek to inform the public, are imperative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mussa report recalls these basic principles, and we will definitely vote in favour of this text. The report also proposes to create cancer registers to target, in the first instance, population groups that show a high incidence due to environmental factors or those linked to dietary habits. This route is fundamental, because we need to go further. Screening, which is certainly essential, is in fact only a secondary prevention measure. We need to act beforehand, to assess the influence of factors such as nutrition, environment, and life style, and to try to reduce their importance. That is real prevention: eliminating the causes or the circumstance propitious to the disease rather than trying too late to cure them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely concerned by the latest statistics that show that lung cancer linked to smoking has spread, in particular in women, and also cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate, that are directly linked to the influence of hormones. We need to bring to the fore the determining factors in the development of these cancers: endocrinal disturbances, dietary hormones or others. In the same way, the increase in prostate cancer in certain groups of farmers is directly linked to the use of pesticides. In addition, it has been proven that pollution, electro magnetic waves or other chemical factors increase the risk of some cancers. Just remember the problem linked to asbestos and the 70 years it took to manage to ban it; only now are our hospitals seeing the full consequences of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to tackle these problems at the roots and extend public health policies to other areas if we really want to fight cancer in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The formerly unmentionable disease has, to some extent, overcome the stigma, not least because of advances in medical science, giving hope to patients and families. These depend on early diagnosis, which comes from screening. The extension of screening needs, as Mr Mussa said, to be based on science. I and my colleagues very much welcome his report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are so many questions about cancer. Concerning breast cancer, screening is well advanced. We must look at how we can extend that to other age groups. We must investigate how we can persuade more men to be aware that breast cancer is a matter for men as well as women and come forward to be screened as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Bowel cancer is a new area for screening, with new tests available. Again, the issue will be how we can educate people – especially men – to come forward to be screened.</p>
<p class="contents">For cervical cancer, the pap smear has proved its worth. Now we need the HPV alongside it. I very much support Mr Mussa's amendments in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Lung cancer is the most deadly. Worldwide, 1.3 million people have lung cancer; 80% of these people die within a year of diagnosis. We need more PET scanners. We only have five in the United Kingdom. I understand that there are 60 in Germany and 150 in the United States. We need to highlight these disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">For prostate cancer, there is screening and the PSA test. There is a demand for these, as we have heard. We should do these tests if and when the evaluation shows its worth. We need the cancer networks. We need the information campaigns highlighted in the amendments that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I have tabled.</p>

<p class="contents">Your proposal to the Council on cancer screening was supported and backed by the representatives of all the political groups in the European Parliament. The rapporteur said that younger and younger people are suffering from various new forms of tumours. Information for and health education of citizens on the prevention and timely detection of symptoms which give danger signals, together with reliable screening, have brought about positive results, such as, for example, with breast cancer, which affects a large percentage of women of reproductive age. Even with those new forms of tumours which cannot be completely cured, a greater chance of survival and better quality of life are now assured.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought it advisable to strengthen the Commission proposal with amendments intended to give citizens equal access to screening, treatment and monitoring services, based always on best practices. Similarly, the need for counselling for those who ultimately contract cancer is proving to be a basic parameter in the final outcome of the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Even saying the word 'cancer' is avoided in numerous countries. Citizens react with fear and panic to anything to do with cancer. We can change fear into productive awareness and care. Only thus will we limit deaths and illness while, at the same time, having a positive effect on all the other social repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur on his essential interventions in the original proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will require political commitment in many countries going far beyond the current commitment in terms of political will and financial investment in cancer testing and treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Reports have shown that up to 90% of the people diagnosed with breast cancer can be cured if they are diagnosed early enough. It has been established that up to 100% of cervical cancers can be cured and prevented if proper testing is carried out in the correct age group along with FPV testing. Clearly this is an area where huge progress can be made in preventing mortality and also a lot of pain and suffering for the individuals concerned and for their families. It is important to have this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to give some statistics on the Irish situation specifically, not because I want to criticise the Irish Government but because, if we are to get cooperation across the board in this area, it is necessary to show how bad the situation is in some countries. For instance, less than 4 000 of the 12 000 patients who require radiotherapy in the Republic of Ireland each year receive it. Public patients face a three-month delay for radiation treatment they have been told is both necessary and urgent. The first five-year analysis of cancer trends in the Irish National Cancer Registry, published in February 2002, showed that 50% of patients with lung cancer received no cancer-specific treatment; 7% of those with leukaemia were not offered chemotherapy; two-thirds of patients in the Republic with last-stage stomach cancer received no cancer-specific treatment. Regional variations and the availability of radiotherapy have a particular impact on poorer patients, since many cancer sufferers have to travel long distances and stay away from home for long periods. The Republic's two radiotherapy units are based in Dublin and Cork, so, while 39% of patients nationally have radiotherapy for breast cancer, only 24% living in the west of Ireland have it. Unfortunately things are not getting any better, because funding for those services has been cut.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the kind of situation we are faced with. I appeal to the House to support the report before us and for the Commissioner to make it clear to all Member States where these appalling statistics apply that they must get to grips with this issue and save lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can reassure you that cancer prevention still figures very high on my agenda. As some Members have rightly stated to me in writing, after 15 years of continuous European Community efforts and involvement, this represents a significant and visible success for the Community in an important area of disease prevention and health promotion for European citizens. Work on cancer, including screening and surveillance, will be taken forward by the Commission. The cancer screening recommendation will be taken forward by Member States' authorities and the Commission, once it is adopted by the Council. Funding will be through ongoing projects within the previous 'Europe Against Cancer' programme and through the new public health programme. For 2003, a number of cancer-related projects have been identified for funding. Under the current contracts, a fourth edition of the European guidelines for quality assurance in mammography screening and the first comprehensive edition of European guidelines for best practice in cervical cancer screening will be finalised in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already enhanced the prevention of diseases, including cancer, in the new health programmes draft work programme for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft specifically provides for a reference to cancer under the first and third strand objectives. This will enable cancer surveillance applications to be fully considered. Project proposals on the status of best practice in the Member States, as well as in acceding countries, would also be covered.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the views expressed today, the Commission intends to review the situation of cancer prevention even further with regard to the public health programmes work programme of 2004. We will then have to decide how to best underpin the Commission's role in cancer prevention, while implementing the Council recommendation on cancer screening.</p>
<p class="contents">As the matter is especially important for acceding countries too, we are considering a meeting between experts from these countries and cancer screening experts, in order to ensure that the achievements of the cancer networks benefit the new Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The points raised in the report and during the debate today have demonstrated clearly the importance of the issue. In the report of the Committee on Environment, Health and Consumer Protection, 33 amendments are proposed. A further amendment was tabled for the plenary session.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can in principle support 11 amendments, namely Amendments 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19, and 22. In addition, we partially support four amendments, Amendments 1, 29, 30 and 32.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to general improvements in the wording of the text, the acceptable amendments concern, for example, improving compliance and equal access for European citizens, as well as enhancing the role of the Commission in following up the implementation of the Council recommendation. The Commission cannot, however, support the remaining 19 amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 25 cannot be supported, as all rules and regulations on data protection in the Member States must be in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC. Exceptions, for instance for medical registries, must be in accordance with Article 8 of the directive. Thus the amendment would simply reiterate the 'acquis communitaire'.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Amendments 5, 13 and 34 cannot be supported. They refer to tests that have not been successfully evaluated in randomised controlled trials.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment 33 cannot be accepted. Even though it makes the necessary distinction between evidence-based tests and new tests currently under evaluation or new variations of recommended tests, these new tests are already sufficiently covered by Articles 6(c) and (d). To mention a few specific ones would immediately raise the question as to why only those tests have been singled out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
