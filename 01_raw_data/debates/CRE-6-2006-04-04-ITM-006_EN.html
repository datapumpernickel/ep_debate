<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Günther Verheugen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the heart of the new growth and employment policy with which we seek to move the Lisbon agenda forward, are the integrated economic guidelines; they are integrated because they reflect the recognition that we cannot satisfactorily perform the task of bringing Europe more growth and more jobs if we fail to make the close connection between macro-economic, micro-economic and employment goals. </p>
<p class="contents">The economic guidelines form the framework within which the Member States and the Community institutions put together their respective plans for the implementation of the strategy for growth and jobs. It was during the past year that the Commission first presented them, and I am grateful to your House for giving them such close attention, for they will be a guide – not only during this year but also thereafter – to what we are considering doing and to the basis on which we will be doing it.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the growth and employment strategy, which we have been trying to implement for something like a year, is a completely new kind of process. It is not yet altogether straightforward to pass final judgment on the elements of this new process, but one thing can be said today, albeit with a great deal of caution, and that is that the Member States have in their national reform programmes, basically allowed themselves to be guided by the priorities set out in the integrated economic guidelines, as has the Commission with its proposal for a Community action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that I should point out that the growth and employment strategy is based on a three-year cycle. What that means is that there is no intention that the guidelines should be amended from one year to another. They may well, though, be adapted to take account of changed realities and the insights that we gain from experience, and that will, of course be necessary, but we do not, at present, see any reason why these guidelines should be amended for 2006; they are still a sound basis for the dialogues in which the Commission is currently engaged with the Member States, the object of which is to get the national reform programmes actually up and running.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As for the individual pillars of this strategy, my fellow-Commissioners Mr Almunia and Mr Špidla will have something more to say about its macro-economic and employment aspects. I would like, briefly, to discuss its micro-economic dimension and highlight the significant advances that have been made in this respect in some areas, particularly as regards the key issue for Europe’s economic future, namely the transition to a knowledge-based society and its becoming an economy founded on innovation, research and development. It was for that reason that we were so insistent on imposing quantitative targets for research and development. </p>
<p class="contents">You will be aware that this was an area in which the national reform programmes produced rather disappointing results, for they would, on average, have brought us up to 2.2% by 2010 instead of the desired 3%. In the few weeks this year in which we have been able to address this issue, we have, however, been able to get the Member States to commit significantly more. If they stick to them, we will be able to achieve 2.6% by 2010, which is an improvement, but – and I have to make this clear – it is not enough, and so the Commission will continue to bring pressure to bear on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council, held the week before last and which you will be discussing tomorrow, also discussed, and came to conclusions on, important aspects of the strategy’s implementation; I would refer you in particular to the Council resolutions on the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses, on improving the lawmaking process and on energy policy. </p>
<p class="contents">From time to time, the question is discussed – in connection with the guidelines – of whether the Commission, when assessing the national reform plans in future, should or should not hand down recommendations specific to the countries in question. We refrained from doing so in the first round for a reason that we regarded as important, namely the fact that we did not know what the national reform programmes would look like, but I would like to point out that the Commission does, self-evidently, retain the option of including country-specific recommendations in future progress reports and that this is an option of which we will avail ourselves as and when necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">At present, though, it strikes me that the most important thing is that we should all work together on making the broader European public aware of the fact that we do actually have a common strategy for growth and job creation, of the priorities that we share, and of the fact that we are working together to deliver on them. </p>

I believe that this fundamental agreement amongst the three European institutions is crucial to the credibility of the process, the acceptance of the objectives of this strategy by all economic and social actors, and not just the European and national institutions, and is one of the conditions – which I believe to be essential – for achieving greater growth and employment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to macroeconomic issues, I would like to refer to three points. Firstly, it is clear that, as we have said on many occasions, and I believe that we agree with Parliament’s opinion, it was important to achieve greater synchronisation amongst the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, in order to achieve more growth and more employment, and the application of the Stability and Growth Pact. Over the last year, this has been achieved. There is more coordination and a better relationship between them and I believe that we are achieving very positive results in practice. The European economy is making better progress today towards fiscal consolidation than it was a year ago, as one of the necessary conditions for more solid growth and growth that is capable of generating employment. The confidence of the economic actors is improving, the results of activity suggest that 2006 is going to offer better results than in 2005 and the perspectives opening up for the future are also positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I entirely agree with what Mr García-Margallo’s report says with regard to the importance of paying more attention to the sustainability of public finances and, in particular, with regard to how to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population. A few weeks ago, the Commission and the Economic Policy Committee, which is made up of all of the Member States, published a report on the economic and budgetary consequences of the ageing of the population. These consequences are significant, but that report also notes that, by acting on time and carrying out reforms, such as those included in many national Lisbon Strategy programmes and those which the different Member States are promoting by means of their initiatives, in particular Commissioner Špidla’s initiatives in the demographic field, results can be seen, and there are now European countries that are in a better position today than five years ago to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population. In October, the Commission is going to publish a report on this issue, which I hope will also be debated and monitored in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point. I am very pleased that, as well as a general analysis of the European economy and of the role of the Lisbon Strategy and of the different instruments included in the broad economic policy guidelines for the economy of twenty-five, Mr García-Margallo’s report makes a particular reference to the challenges and needs of the eurozone, in which the twelve countries that share the single currency, the euro, need mechanisms for coordination and special attention in order to obtain the best possible results from the economic and monetary union. We would like to thank Mr García-Margallo for pointing this out in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is constructive in two ways: it adds to the underlying body of knowledge and it ought to speed up adoption by the Council, in comparison with previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the spring session of the European Council it was stated that the Union would be capable of creating 2 million jobs per year. Yet job creation and cuts in unemployment will not happen unless we take advantage of the current economic growth to continue with the necessary reforms. The session provided confirmation that the integrated guidelines remain valid, at the same time setting out which priorities would be attracting greater emphasis. I am delighted that the parliamentary committee is advocating a similar approach and that it has not agreed to any excessive changes to the underlying principles of employment policy. We are amenable to changes in the points of justification, but by the same token we want to stick with the original wording of the text itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year the Lisbon Strategy was redefined in respect of the integrated set of basic principles behind employment policy and the guidelines for economic policy. The Strategy has a tri-annual nature, in the interests of creating a clear and stable political framework for the bodies entrusted with its implementation. A study carried out by the Commission into the first of the national reform programmes has uncovered specific shortcomings in respect of Member State implementation, although these do not undermine the validity of the basic principles. It would therefore be inappropriate to give the impression that we wish to change the direction or content of the policies at this point. The text proposed by the Commission deliberately left open the possibility of supplementing the points of justification with specific political priorities. It therefore clearly goes along with Parliament’s desire to include in the points of justification some elements of an economic and social nature which require particular attention, especially where they accord with the conclusions of the latest spring session of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The session placed an emphasis on the need to increase employment especially among young people, women, older people and people with health problems, legitimate migrants and minorities. In the case of young people there was confirmation of the goal of reducing by 10% the numbers of those not finishing school, and offering every young person employment, work experience or further education within six months of leaving school by 2007 and within four months by 2010, as set out in the current main principles. In the case of older workers the emphasis was on the need to introduce an integrated strategy based on quality jobs and specialist training. Concerning equal opportunities for men and women, the spring session of the European Council adopted the European Pact for Gender Equality, and the Council also adopted the Commission proposal to launch a wide-ranging debate which should lead to the adoption of common principles in the area of flexibility and security (‘flexsecurity’) by the end of 2007. The aim of this discussion with the Member States and social partners is to reduce the segmentation of the labour market and to strike the right balance between flexibility and security.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say how delighted I am that the Commission proposal to set up a European globalisation adjustment fund was favourably received at the spring summit. This bears witness to the desire to make more effective use of Community funds in support of European employment strategy, and in accordance with the wishes of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the ‘Lisbon process’ is starting to become a code phrase too, even though it represents our common future. If the Member States of the Union are competitive, we will have more and better jobs. If more people find jobs, poverty will be reduced. Also, this would provide more resources for the reform of social systems, and to enable us to preserve our environment for our grandchildren. I would like to strongly emphasise that work that is not accompanied by and founded on social security cannot produce significant economic results. And if this is true, which it is, then we can welcome the decision of the Council and Commission, that Member States should assess the implementation of the Directives on employment and economic development in integrated Directives, evaluating the two issues in connection with one another. We can see that the picture has become richer, especially through the fact that the European Commission has now assessed the action plans of 25 Member States. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has acknowledged and accepted that on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreements, Parliament will not change the guidelines annually – and I believe that this will also serve the interests of the Member States – and it will only change them in the event of any problems arising on the employment market of the European Union. At the same time, in the specifications of political aims – contained in the preamble – we considered it important to include in the parliamentary document the lessons learned from the first report prepared after the ten new Member States joined the European Union. The committee agreed, almost unanimously, that Parliament should participate more actively in the verification of the implementation of the guidelines. In this respect, we will contact the competent Commission official. In my report I wished to complement the presentation of the Commission in respect of three important matters of principle; my colleagues, the members of the committee, have made a significant contribution to insure that these are presented clearly and comprehensively. Primarily, we emphatically call attention to the improvement of the labour market opportunities of social groups with various disadvantages. And, as mentioned by the Commissioners, this is also a precondition of further economic growth. A huge reserve for increasing labour resources is firstly to increase the activity of women, secondly, to maintain the ageing or aged workforce on the labour market or to encourage their return, and thirdly, to help young people find jobs and enter the labour market. However, we believe that the elimination of the disadvantages that keep away a part of the people from the labour market today is at least as important. We also call attention to the anomaly that workers coming from third countries may have a more favourable position on the European labour market than citizens of new Member States. We will have the opportunity to discuss this problem in connection with the <span class="bold">Ő</span>ry report, but I would already like to say, on the basis of the news we have recently heard, that we welcome the Netherlands to the ‘club of the 6’ (as the seventh country, from 2007). And finally, thirdly, we believe that without a long-term financial perspective it is not possible to provide adequate resources to Member States for the tasks that are specified as fundamental goals in the integrated guidelines either.</p>
<p class="contents">Polite words are fashionable here, but this is not politeness or force of habit: I would like to say a sincere thank you to my colleagues – irrespective of their party affiliation – and to the representatives of the various political groups for their help and contribution, and separately to Ana Mato Adrover, the co-rapporteur of the report. There is hope that the phrase ‘unity through diversity’ will not be a slogan only, but also an opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioners, the discussion of the broad economic policy guidelines has given us many headaches in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make sure the headache is not so severe this year, I shall restrict myself to three questions: why has Parliament decided to produce a report despite the fact that the Commission has chosen to ratify the previous reports? What can we do to ensure that our reports are heard? And thirdly, what is it that we want the Commission to hear?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, why a report? Because previous reports contained masses of recommendations that the Commission has not taken into account. Secondly, because, since we discussed the previous report, new factors have arisen: the relative failure of the European Constitution, a new financial perspective, some first interest rate rises, three candidates seeking to join the eurozone, and the Doha Round, which continues the Hong Kong trade talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because there are certain factors that we have taken up in other reports, but which have become more important over time. Commissioner Almunia referred to the ageing of the population and we should also talk about the consequences of immigration, the consequences of Chinese imports, once the quantitative restrictions have come to an end, about world imbalances, essentially in relation to the United States, and finally the energy crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do in order to be heard? This report has been drawn up in a spirit of consensus, which has obliged many of us to give way on our particular points of view, and I would like in particular to thank all of the representatives of the other parliamentary groups for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to be heard, the first thing I must point out here is that previously we have not been heard. This report begins with a kind of catalogue of grievances, a list of recommendations that we have made and that the Commission has not taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">We asked for a transposition of directives, which has not happened, a reduction of deficits — Commissioner Almunia has pointed out that 12 of the 25 Member States are currently in a situation of excessive deficit — a communication on globalisation in order to make clear to the public the opportunities and challenges it presents — and if this communication had been produced, it would have spared us a few headaches — and we also called for the application of the charters on small and medium-sized businesses, something which has not been done.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this report deals with what we might call institutional issues, whether of a constitutional nature or not. During this period of active reflection — which is neither a reflection nor active — we are dealing with those questions which were left over from the Convention and which have not been answered: what are the Union’s objectives and competences? What are the responsibilities of the European Central Bank, while respecting its independence at all times? What should we do in order to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact? What are the legal bases for modifying taxation in the Union and in the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">There is one explicit recommendation that I would ask the Commission to take particular note of: this Parliament will not approve any directive by means of the Lamfalussy procedure if the problem of call-back is not resolved by 2008, ultimately the international representation of the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Vice-President of the Commission has referred to coordinating the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines within a single document: it is true, but they are still subject to different information and consultation procedures which make them difficult to understand. Furthermore, it is necessary to incorporate other documents in order to ensure that it is not fragmentary.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to taxation in an institutional sense, we call upon the Commission to respond to what the High Court of Justice has said: a uniform definition of tax residence, as an extension of citizenship, the principle of non-discrimination and a convention on double taxation. With regard to coordination, I was pleased with Commissioner Almunia’s kind words: it is true that we have to coordinate more, we must make a precise diagnosis, draw up a correct cure, an analysis of what has happened and define the role of the Eurogroup.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of macroeconomic policy, we do not go into the issue of interest rates, we do not express our opinion. We do say that we have to do everything possible to ensure that prices do not rise and interest stays low. We refer to public debt, in terms used by the Commissioner: less interest, less repayments, means more spending on ageing, more Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the business climate, we call for serious reflection. The United States are ahead of us. 144 of the world’s top companies are from the European Union, while in the case of the United States, that figure stands at 206. Small and medium-sized businesses double their employment in the first two years, something that does not happen in Europe. We are calling for positive discrimination to be applied in favour of small and medium-sized businesses, with particular reference to the funding of risk capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of taxation, to put it in simple terms, we ask that Home State Taxation be used for companies in application of the principle of place of origin with regard to VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">I have nothing to say with regard to human capital. My colleague has expressed this very well.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of investment: trans-European networks. It would take twenty years to finish them.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy, R+D+I, more market, more competition, more competitiveness.</p>

<p class="contents">As we know, scarcely a year ago, the employment guidelines were approved, and it was my honour to be rapporteur on that occasion. Those guidelines established the general approach to employment and the priorities for the next three years, and their purpose was to make an effective contribution to employment growth, the productivity of the economy and, of course, strengthening social inclusion and cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">These guidelines, which were debated jointly with the economic policy guidelines, which this year have been presented brilliantly by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, have been taken up and translated into concrete objectives in the national reform plans, approved scarcely six months ago by the Member States. Both through common sense – they were approved scarcely a year ago and they are for three years – and as a result of the content of the guidelines themselves, we have simply updated them.</p>
<p class="contents">Of what has this updating consisted? Three broad areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have taken up the priority issues that have been highlighted at the big European summits held this year: firstly, investment in research, development and innovation and the spread of information technologies, an aspect which is furthest from achieving the Lisbon objectives; secondly, genuine and effective equality of opportunities, which our group has always advocated, and which includes the incorporation of women, permanent positions for them and their promotion in the workplace and, of course, equal pay; and, thirdly, we strongly advocate stable employment, and I say this because the majority of work that is being created is precarious. In my country, for example, 52% of all work created over the last two years has been temporary work, and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have repeated certain fundamental issues which have not been adequately dealt with by the Commission. In the fight against accidents in the workplace we advocated a broad agreement at European level, which we believe to be essential, since in Spain, for example, 990 people lost their lives in 2005, and also help for the victims of domestic violence in finding work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, since we are now updating them, we want this Parliament to be able to monitor the employment guidelines and compliance with them by the Member States.</p>

<p class="contents">What we have to discuss – and this debate is fundamental to our doing so – is whether we have equipped ourselves with all the instruments we will need on this voyage, and whether we are making the right use of the instruments we have in order to give this internal market the right framework and influence the processes of economic development in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make two observations which go beyond today’s debate and these reports. We will not succeed in this objective if we do not succeed – and soon – in putting the European Union on an independent and accountable financial footing, nor will we succeed in it if we do not succeed in talking about taboo subjects, including the need for a common fiscal policy in this European Union of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason I say this is that, in the economic situation in which we find ourselves, there is no longer any justification for taboos of any kind. Anyone who brings fresh air into this debate has my backing, for, if we consider the economic situation, we simply cannot afford to carry on letting debates be ritualistic and keeping fresh air out of this House and out of our debates. In 2005, our economic development lagged behind what it had been in 2004; our unemployment rate is still alarmingly high at around nine per cent, and long-term unemployment in particular is again on the rise. I am very glad to hear Commissioner Almunia say – and he has my backing for saying it – that there are indications of the economy developing in the right direction, but I have to tell him that there is no guarantee that the European Union will be able to fuel its own recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have to talk about what needs to be put on the agenda. When will we in the European Union at last introduce a common investment policy? That is the most urgent thing we have to do. When will we start investing, as a Community, in research and development? In the last ten years, we have managed to increase that investment from 1.8% to 1.9%. When will we start on better and longer-term investment in education, with a coordinated strategy in the Member States? When will we start making use of the great potential of energy efficiency? That is where the key to the next technological revolution is to be found, so let us set to work!</p>
<p class="contents">Where, in this field, are the Member States investing money? Where is Europe-wide discussion of it being guided? Looking at the transport sector, we sometimes feel that we actually ought to rewrite Delors’ White Paper in view of the many transposition deficits in this area, and if we were to face up to them and invest more, we could make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Childcare is one of the core issues. If we invest more in childcare, we get higher birthrates and more people – women in particular – into the workplace; that much is demonstrated by statistics. We support all those who want to make advances in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you, once and for all, to put cooperation with this House on a proper institutional footing, and then we will no longer need – and I thank Mr García-Margallo for pointing this out – to spend our time merely writing own-initiative reports, but discussions in this House will be on a different and stable basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that this combination of factors differs from country to country and must take into account peculiarities of the national economy. On the evidence of the unsuccessful experience of the International Monetary Fund in attempting to create a single universal model, it is doubtful whether we should try to create an economic strategy model on a European scale. I believe that we must stress three basic points. First of all, we ought to agree with Mr Garcia-Margallo's view that we must consolidate all economic policy documents; there are too many of them and they are repetitive.

The employment policy guidelines now not only serve as the formal basis for the national employment plans, but also make their influence felt on the shape and development of national labour markets, and so it is not a matter of indifference that the Council should simply walk off with the fourth pillar of the European employment policy, equality of opportunity for women in the labour market. Women are hit much harder by unemployment than are men; it is they, still, who do most of the part-time jobs. They still earn 15% less than men for comparable work, and they have fewer opportunities for promotion. They still find it much harder to get back into the labour market, especially where there is no universal, freely accessible and all-day childcare.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender mainstreaming still needs to be backed up by pro-active measures to promote the interests of women, and so I really am very grateful to Mrs Kósáné Kovács for making it possible for us to agree on a compromise, at any rate in the recitals, in order to incorporate into the guidelines measurable indicators for the promotion of equality of opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to a second amendment. We want Guideline No 22 to be deleted. We believe that wages should be determined by the parties to a collective agreement, and must be kept out of political resolutions. I cannot but note, to my considerable disquiet, that there seems to be in this House a tacit agreement between the two main groups to the effect that, in future, governmental policy decisions, in the shape of national employment plans, should ensure that overall wages trends be brought into line with the rise of productivity in the economic cycle. I had thought that the planned economy with which we were familiar in the former East Germany had been banished from Europe once and for all, until I realised that the guidelines determine the support to be given by the European Social Fund. It would be inconsistent for the ESF to determine wages; that is something that the two sides of industry are quite capable of doing, and should be left to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is, first of all, because priority is attached to ensuring economic stability, to enlarging and deepening the internal market, to opening up the markets and promoting competition, and to creating a more business-friendly environment. All of which is music to the ears of the large economic and financial groups, and to the overlords of international trade who, enjoying the fruits of exploiting cheap labour from third countries, prefer the enormous returns from relocating production to maintaining and developing jobs with rights in EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the guidelines for employment are much too vague, as they omit key areas, such as the need to increase female involvement in the labour market, and to ensure high-quality jobs with rights. This would help to combat the kind of salary- and career-related discrimination that women continue to fall victim to, and would not lead to the precarious, poorly-paid work that we see today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also crucial to boost regional economies, to promote micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and to create jobs in regions where there are high levels of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Families must also be supported, both in terms of rearranging and reducing working hours, without any loss of rights, and in terms of investing in public services to support the family, as this would help to create jobs better suited to local and regional needs. Greater public investment is therefore urgently required in health, housing and guaranteed access to free, high-quality education and training. We have therefore tabled a proposal to attach these guidelines to the proposals submitted, as we believe it is vital to include them in the guidelines for employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge for Ireland and Europe will be to implement the agreed guidelines via the national reform programmes. It is of utmost importance that Europe gains economic stability.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I absolutely reject all sections of this report that call for support for the Commission’s common consolidated corporate tax base. The setting of a common base is intrinsically linked to a harmonised rate. Member States need to be realistic in recognising that the introduction of a common tax base is simply the thin edge of the wedge towards tax harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State. The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies, rather the EU’s competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies. Competition can actually have a harmonising effect. I believe that tax competition harmonises opportunities within the EU and it enables small countries on the periphery of the Union to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, overall I welcome the role of state aid in supporting the Lisbon objectives. However, I would like to stress that state aid rules should not be used to block Ireland or any other Member State from competing against non-EU countries for important foreign direct investment. Europe needs flexibility to move forward and meet the challenges of globalisation. Europe needs to reform its economies, and all countries should do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, let us do that. The French took a 35-hour working week, not a 48-hour week.

The notion that the interests of a particular country can be protected by restricting freedom of movement within the EU is pie in the sky. This kind of attitude may work as a short term panacea but will never properly solve the challenges facing the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for Europe to gain a firmer foothold in an increasingly globalised world, it needs, first and foremost, to press ahead with liberalising the markets. As we know, the demographic situation on the European continent and the phenomenon of globalisation make it imperative that we carry out a range of reforms to the social and economic models of many EU Member States. The higher the economic growth in Europe, the easier it will be to carry out these reforms, but in order for that growth to emerge, the internal market must be functioning completely. While Europe grows at rates of 1, 2 or even 3%, it is very difficult to implement these reforms, which are so vital for peace and social stability in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to highlight the fact that the completion of the internal market of course contains an economic component, but there is a further crucial element, and that is social policy. This is yet another reason why I support the Commission’s efforts thus far in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one final remark about the free movement of workers. By putting up certain types of barrier to the free movement of workers, some Member States are actually in the preposterous situation of helping workers from third countries to gain access to jobs ahead of those from new EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in Parliament have, of course, come out in favour of the Guidelines being long-term three-year cycles and of their being integrated. Once suitably long-term, integrated Guidelines are in place, it is incredibly important for us to examine the National Reform Programmes. It is important for the Commission to do this, but it is also important for Parliament to be involved in examining and following up the National Reform Programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Almunia said that the economic prospects are better now. That is true, but the employment situation in Europe is anything but encouraging. It is entirely possible that it can be improved, but allow me to discuss three areas that are extremely worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the question of youth unemployment. This is of very great concern because, if young people leave education only to be immediately unemployed – and in the long term, at that – it is incredibly difficult to get them back into the labour market subsequently. I do not believe in the French model or believe, as a number of other parties expressly do, that employment is boosted by making one particular group or another less secure. Employment is stimulated through proactive industrial and labour market policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the older labour force is concerned, we have the dilemma that people are leaving the EU labour market far too early nowadays. Older workers need to be able to develop their skills to a higher degree, but we also need to increase health and safety in workplaces.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn, finally, to gender equality, which must permeate everything. I welcome the Gender Equality Pact which is now, or will in time be, part of the Lisbon process. It is especially important that child care and other areas be developed so that it is possible for men and women alike both to work and to have an up-and-running family life.

If we are to get our 20 million unemployed back to earning their own living, a change of policy is needed, and in practice rather than in theory. The guidelines constitute the main instrument for coordinating the economic policies of the Member States in the effective manner that is required, but, in practice, progress so far has been regrettably unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore calls for renewed efforts; what we expect to see from the Member States is sounder budget policies, real structural reforms on the labour market and in health and pensions, and markedly more investment in education and research. At the European level, we call for the creation of a single tax base for the taxation of businesses, improvements in the VAT systems, for the adoption of the 14th companies directive, which will make it easier for companies to put themselves on an international footing; for further reductions in subsidies, the introduction of a Community patent and the consistent opening-up of the markets. Only when we have put our houses in order in this way will we be able think about introducing EU-wide taxes, which is what Mr Bullmann is calling for.

The rapporteur has considered some fundamental issues relating to employment, which at the current time – a time of obsession over economic growth – are often overlooked, and these include the issues of equal opportunity for men and women, access to employment for young and old people, health and safety at work and freedom of movement for workers throughout the Union. On the basis of experience from the Czech Republic and conversations with colleagues, and also looking at the current situation in France, I know that the issue of first jobs for graduates, for example, is often one of the most challenging.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that there have been efforts at a solution on the part of the European Commission, the recommendations and instruments of the European Commission have so far had little effect, due in part to patchy implementation by the Member States, as the rapporteur has stated. It is precisely this area that should be occupying most of our attention, together with age discrimination on the labour market. Equality of opportunity between men and women on the labour market is unquestionably an important issue. We know from the statistics that even though women constitute a growing segment of society, this trend is not reflected in their share of employment. What is more striking still is the proportion of women in leading positions. We must call on all Member States to apply anti-discrimination laws scrupulously and without delay, in order that this pattern may be reversed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for having drawn attention in the report to restrictions on the free movement of labour within the European Union internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the most recent enlargement of the European Union was perceived within the internal market as a threat, instead of a new opportunity. The mythical Polish plumber, who in real life would be welcome, but is difficult to find, clearly illustrates the fears which after enlargement now hold sway in the European Union internal market. We see a negative attitude towards all four market freedoms, and not just the free movement of labour.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a pity that the report provides no assessment of the draft Services Directive as watered down by this Parliament, which in the variant put forward by the Commission was supposed in the coming years to become the main stimulus for the labour market in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the report did not assess the negative repercussions for employment of restrictions on the free movement of capital. These include those restrictions adopted by this Parliament at last month’s part-session in Strasbourg. I am referring to the report entitled ‘Restructuring and employment’ and particularly the report entitled ‘Relocation in the context of regional development’. The main <span class="italic">leitmotiv</span> of both reports is the creation of restrictions preventing businesses from freely relocating within the European Union internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a time of untapped opportunities for boosting the European Union labour market. The development and strengthening of the European Union’s internal market is the most effective tool in preparing the Member States’ labour market for increasing global competition. Therefore, we ought to look at the basic approach of the Member States’ employment policies in close connection with the goal of developing the potential of the European Union internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was decided at the Stockholm Summit that the attempt should be made to incorporate environmental policy and social policy into the economic policy guidelines, with the aim of establishing a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union. Since, in my view, the environmental aspects of economic policy get a raw deal, I would call for the inclusion in the economic policy guidelines of clear and specific environmental objectives, in addition to references to the importance of the environment. There should also be targets with regard to energy consumption and CO2 emission reductions. Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with a responsible use of natural resources, and that is why I will support Mr Lipietz’s amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see that Mr Karas is next on the list to speak; well, Othmar, here comes an easy ball for you. The effect of what is happening now is that the EU mainstream rubs its eyes and says, ‘yes, we really do have a problem’, but I ask you to think forward to the move after this one. The Prognos study is an impressive demonstration of the fact that we will not, of course, achieve full employment in the next couple of decades. On the contrary, we will be moving towards what one of the journalists on the <span class="italic">New York Times </span>calls the ‘disposable American’, or, to put it in our terms, the ‘disposable European’. It is to that that we will have to find solutions. We have an enormous problem with the loss of the services that have provided jobs to replace the industrial jobs that are no longer there. This is where we need to move ahead, this is where we need approaches that are good for more than just today. Indeed so: one core issue, one potential starting point, is the reallocation of all these millions and billions that are still hidden away in the EU’s budget and being wasted on pointless things. I am thinking, for example, of the way in which the most-subsidised sector of agriculture in France is the production of rice. We also have a chance, in the current absence of a finalised Financial Perspective, to make more improvements here and of accomplishing even now what you will otherwise do only after another five or ten years, when it will, again, be almost too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need them because we do not have a common economic policy, and the reason why we do not have a common economic policy is that the instruments for a pro-active economic policy are in the hands of the Member States – research policy, fiscal policy, education policy, to name but three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Since our last report, conditions have in many respects become more acute. It is becoming more and more apparent to us that the European Union’s potential for growth is not being exploited to the full, that we are insufficiently prepared for demographic change, and that we have not yet made full use of the opportunities that globalisation is presenting to our continent. What the energy crisis and high unemployment show is that our problems are not only home-made, but that they also originate from structural and global causes, and that it is these that we must address in a pro-active manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We want codecision for this European Parliament in all matters touching upon the single market, for in all of them we need more Europe in cooperation with the Member States than currently exists in reality. This report, therefore, constitutes our demand for the transposition of all the internal market directives, inconsistent implementation of which distorts competition and costs us growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand budget consolidation measures on the part of the states with excessive deficits, for failure to repair our social security and pensions systems will bar us from participation in global competition.

It is also the occasion for <span class="italic">ex ante </span>coordination of the economic policies of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament, we have supported integrating the employment policy guidelines into the broad economic policy guidelines. I think that, in terms of intellectual consistency, that was the right approach, provided that they do not lose substance, and in particular provided that the powers of this Parliament are also harmonised. I support the rapporteur's proposals in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of the broad economic policy guidelines, we find ourselves faced with a paradox: while the Central Bank has just increased interest rates by a percentage point in quick succession, while rising oil prices are seriously compromising the conditions for economic recovery within the European Union, and while the conditions for the recovery of domestic demand are widely underestimated by various representatives at EU level, these broad guidelines are not shifting.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to us that, from this point of view, we need to do more together with regard to at least one point: I am referring to investment strategy. My group has tabled an amendment in this connection, which I hope will be adopted by plenary. It emphasises the need, if we are really going to implement the Lisbon Strategy, to draw up, at EU level, the investment plans that we need in order to support the policies that will enable us to confront the challenges facing us in terms of knowledge, training and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by emphasising the issue of taxation, which underpins our entire economic system. I hope that the whole of the Commission, and the Council too, will echo this and will support Commissioner Kovács' efforts on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is losing the competition war to the USA, China and India. The EU should prepare for the challenges of globalisation by reforming itself from within. We failed to adopt the Constitution, the financial perspective is deadlocked and less funds are being allocated to the trans-European Networks. Without a common energy policy, the supply of energy resources, which form the basis of an economy's competitiveness, is threatened, as is security. With the admission of the new candidates, Slovenia and Lithuania, the enlargement of the Euro zone would be one of the actions and decisions which would stimulate economic growth. I would like to mention two important factors for increasing the EU's competitiveness – investment in information and innovations and the accelerated creation of a common energy policy. These are inter-dependent factors – innovations allow leaders to emerge, while in this sector – energy, which determines competitiveness, innovations allow the creation of new sources of energy and the rational and economical use of existing ones. While negotiations on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 are still under way, we ought to reconsider the funding priorities and increase the funding of science, research and the trans-European Networks. On the subject of the competitiveness of the EU economy, I would like to mention one of the EU's most successful projects – the introduction of the common currency, the Euro, in 12 Member States. With the enlargement of the Euro zone approaching, we can also see certain shortcomings: the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact are not being adhered to, there is considerable state debt and at various stages almost all of the Euro zone members have failed to satisfy the price stability index. The experience of five years demonstrates the need to improve the Maastricht criteria themselves. However, fundamentally, the Euro zone was and still is a political project, which has shown its use and it must go on to a new stage of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Employment law of this nature that is flexible regarding both the place of employment and the hours worked encourages women to be active in the labour market. For women, motherhood represents an enormous challenge in their working lives. Flexibility also makes it possible for the youngest and oldest workers to join the labour force and obtain employment, which is currently a major problem. Not everyone in Europe is in favour of such flexibility, as is obvious from events taking place on the streets of Paris. The only action we can therefore take at European level is to scale down harmonisation in this area, so as to achieve flexibility in at least some countries and areas of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were asked to identify a key word relating to economic policy it would have to be competition along with tax competition. Contrary to statements in the report, competition is not detrimental to the financing of public needs. The opposite is actually the case, as increased receipts have been recorded by the national budgets of countries that recently radically reformed their tax systems, notably by reducing corporate taxes. Tax competition in countries such as Ireland or Slovakia also contributes to increasing the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, thus improving our competitiveness at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, tax competition does not threaten Europe in any way. It actually represents a tremendous opportunity. I fear, however, that it may be one of the few real opportunities open to us, if not the only one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The goal is to strengthen the European Union’s potential with regard to a new generation of products and production methods by harnessing information and communication technologies. I also support the call for EU Member States to promote private investment. The shift of public and private capital expenditure towards investments that generally increase economic performance and productivity will also be important.

As the report frequently reiterates, one of the serious problems facing the European Union at present is the fact that most Member States underestimate the need for far-reaching structural reform. Paradoxically, some Member States have tried to address the loss of competitiveness that is a natural consequence of rejecting such reform by implementing new measures to protect their markets, which only makes the problem worse. We must again concede that the internal market is not fully functional and does not enable the free movement of labour or the free provision of services. The consequences of this approach are markedly negative. Companies have been relocating their operations to areas with cheaper labour or, alternatively, have been outsourcing them, which has also caused job contraction.</p>
<p class="contents">In macroeconomic terms, one major result of such a policy is slow growth and, given the unchanged structure of public finances, a deteriorating general government deficit, frequently exceeding the limits imposed under the Stability and Growth Pact. If we take into consideration the low volumes of investment in research, technological development and innovation, and if we add the high energy dependence of most Member States, we can hardly expect a significant increase in the competitiveness of the European economy vis-à-vis major global players such as the USA and China. We must respond quickly to these challenges by putting in place a fully functional internal market, operating without any discrimination and unhampered by unnecessary regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The harmonisation of European legislation must advance rather than hinder the competitive environment. Efforts to harmonise corporate income tax provide unfortunate examples of such hindrance. In order to increase the internal competitiveness of Member States, and hence of the entire EU, the subsidiarity principle must become a significant component of all Commission initiatives. In this respect, I also welcome the action programme on state aid reform that puts conditions in place for more investment into research, technological development and innovation, aiming to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises. By the same token, we should praise the Green Paper on a European strategy for a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should indeed reflect a wide anti-discrimination policy, the promotion of gender equality providing a tool for tackling the gender gaps in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Employment Strategy must be regarded not only as a tool for attracting more people to the labour market; it should also present a favourable and open opportunity to join the labour market for those who have particularly limited access to employment, such as older women, single parents and ethnic minorities. It must be admitted that the challenge of Europe’s ageing society can only be tackled with the increased participation of those special groups in the labour market, as Commissioner Špidla said.</p>
<p class="contents">All kinds of obstacles must be eliminated. We are striving for more and better jobs, having declared 2006 the European Year of Workers’ Mobility. For Europe’s workforce, mobility provides for new skills, new experiences, flexibility and a capacity to adapt to the different working conditions and constantly changing market needs. Mobility is a value contributing to the benefit of the whole European economy. That is an urgent need that must be recognised by some Member States which still maintain barriers to the new EU countries’ workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that the EES has the potential to become the strategy to move towards full employment, making work a real option for all, increasing the quality and productivity of work, and anticipating and managing change, highlighting a more cohesive society of equal opportunities for anyone striving to promote diversity and non-discrimination.</p>

It appears, however, that the report fails to focus appropriately on the most difficult area of the economy, the one that consumes most Union resources, requires protection and is inadequately exploited in economic terms. I refer to the agricultural sector in its broadest sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The most substantial payments benefit magnates, whilst small farms are going out of business and the amount of uncultivated land is increasing along with the number of people who have lost their jobs and all hope for the future. The enormous potential of the sector remains unexploited, although sound policies could enable it to make a positive contribution to the development of the wider economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme of activities aimed at developing industrial crops is not ambitious enough, and the research and implementation programme fails to provide the necessary backing for swift progress. We are lagging behind countries whose economies are efficient in this regard. The issue merits broad debate and calls for swift and effective action to be taken in the course of 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these is that it is those European economies that are most open to globalisation that now have the best economic development. The second is that it is those countries that have the most flexible labour markets that also have the best development in terms of new jobs. It is in the light of this that I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for the work he has done, because it is the changes and policy direction proposed in his report that constitute the approach that can provide more jobs and greater prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial question is that of whether all this will lead to changes and of whether policy will be changed at European and Member State level. A Swedish politician once said that ‘if things are allowed to go on operating as they have done in the past, things will proceed unchanged’. We now have more than 20 million unemployed. That is an economic issue, but it is also to the very highest degree a social issue. There is no issue more important for social protection than the growth of new jobs. In this area, the Commission has a number of tasks with which it must get to grips.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it must implement those directives that open the way to greater competition. Secondly, it must take action to open the door to more enterprise, and that brings the whole of competition policy into focus. New enterprise does not only mean the growth of small companies. It also means the ability to establish new cross-border companies in Europe that can be ‘global champions’. The Commission must assume responsibility for doing these things, but the Member States also have a responsibility to implement those reforms that will give rise to new enterprise. Finally, we must ensure that we obtain more flexible labour markets in Europe. If we do not do so, we shall be excluding millions of people from the labour market and from social protection. Those who are in favour of social protection and economic development are also in favour of more flexible labour markets. I am happy to say all this to those on the Social Democratic side, for it is reforms that provide security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe’s economies are developing slowly, we have high unemployment and our public finances are in crisis. The situation has remained unchanged for a number of years and may result in Europe losing its leading role in the world. Major structural reform is needed, together with a change of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad economic policy guidelines put forward by the Commission correctly identify the essential action required. This includes creating more flexible labour markets and a business-friendly environment, in addition to supporting education, training and research. The Commission has been advocating all this for years, however, to no great avail. I would remind the House that the reasons for the weakness of European economies are well known. So too is the nature of the action required to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs. Unfortunately, politicians in the Member States are reluctant to take the necessary measures for fear of losing popularity or because of short-sighted political calculations or even sheer ignorance at times. Europe is actually suffering from a crisis of political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate ought to be directed principally towards the governments of Member States and the political circles supporting them. It should aim to send out alarm signals to the effect that if essential reforms are not undertaken, Europe is likely to stagnate and fall behind. The economic and social progress it has achieved will also be threatened. A politician’s brief is actually to resolve specific problems, not to be subservient to popularity polls and the voters’ whims. We are relying on politicians in the Member States to undertake the relevant reforms and persuade their citizens that they are indeed necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to take strong and decisive action in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for the hard work he has put in on this topic. The report spells out once more the fact that the European Union presents the people of Europe, in the face of globalisation, with an opportunity to find a fair compromise between economic conditions on the one hand and social conditions on the other. The problem is, though, that this has completely passed the people of Europe by. The 20 million unemployed and the hundreds of millions of people who fear for their jobs attribute their circumstances more to the European Union than to globalisation. The others, whose jobs are kept safe by the European Union and by the work of the Commission and of this House, are completely unaware of that fact and attribute it to the national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say how much I am in agreement with Mr Rosati: It would indeed be much to be desired, when considering these important issues, for the Council, which alone is competent to act on many of these issues in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, to apply itself with greater earnestness to this matter and if the debates in this House were not to be in the hands only of its own Members and the Members of the Commission, and, while it is indeed the case that the Commission does have an important function to perform in ensuring that the measures already adopted at Council level are actually implemented by the Member States, we must nevertheless be honest, for – as we shall probably see later on when considering the Őry report – what matters at the end of the day is that the Member States should keep to what they themselves once decided.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is very good that the Commission has indicated – indeed, Commissioner Špidla has been saying so to the German media – that bringing greater flexibility to the labour markets is the only way we in Europe can provide our people with more work, and that this, being a means whereby work is created, must not be a source of anxiety. That, in fact, is what we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore strongly encourage you to spell it out to the Member States with greater emphasis that the decisions taken by the Council need, at last, to be put into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the end of the day, this is our only hope: the only hope for Europe to work in a coordinated fashion in the direction embarked upon last year of enriching the economic and social vision with new guidelines which fall within this framework of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen said that we need this strategy to be visible. This is one of our deficits, as is our credibility deficit as well, as Commissioner Almunia said. We need those jobs, as Commissioner Špidla said.</p>
<p class="contents">In the very short space of time available to me, therefore, I would like to ask you to read these two reports by Parliament.

<p class="contents">Read what these reports say and demonstrate the leadership that Europe needs today. The Commission’s people must be active, in order to oblige the governments to apply this European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Please be consistent, look at our amendments. Look at Amendment 2, for example. We need the European legislation that we already have to be applied, since it makes work between the Member States much more consistent.</p>

All that remains is for those recommendations to be heeded.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand, we should be speaking of deepening, rather than reviewing, the Lisbon Strategy, given that what we are now seeing – and have been since the outset – is increased economic growth and more jobs, both of which help to sustain the social models in the long term, and foster adequate social cohesion in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of recent progress, the key issues remain untouched. Unemployment is at an intolerable level and overall economic growth is insufficient to reverse this trend. Consequently, greater integration and better coordination of economic policies is required, and the work of the institutions forming the emerging economic government of the Union must be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council decided to support the Commission in drawing up a common European energy policy. Although this was an interesting decision, it still falls short of what is required. The Union’s energy dependency is unsustainable. Oil imports currently account for 2.3% of Union GDP, which is two and a half times the budget earmarked for all European policies. By 2030, that dependency may prove overwhelming, especially in the oil sector (94% of foreign dependency). The simple agreements between Member States promoted by the Council are therefore inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased competition is a necessary prerequisite to the creation of a common energy policy. A common regulation will, above all, require huge investment if existing networks are to be improved and if genuine progress is to be made once again in the area of alternative energy and energy saving. All of this is vital to increasing competitiveness and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has listened very carefully, and we will pay very careful attention to what the groups and the speakers have told us, and will, in future debates, endeavour to take on board your House’s wishes and suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by reiterating, and very clearly, that the reason why growth and employment are priorities for the years ahead of us is that without more growth and the creation of more jobs, we will be unable to realise our great and far-reaching political goals. We will not be able to maintain a high environmental standard, we will not be able to maintain high social standards, and we will not be able to maintain a high standard of living if we do not have strong economic foundations that can bear their weight, and that is why we say that growth and jobs are our number one task.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines, which we have been discussing today, are among the essential means whereby we ensure that we in Europe are able, perhaps, to make a virtue of necessity. Our inability to have a common economic policy is of course a defect, but it can become a virtue if we can agree on a new kind of cooperation of the kind that we have developed in the shape of the Partnership for Growth and Jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European economy suffers from a lower demographic growth, employment rate and productivity. Europe must foresee long-term strategies and sufficient resources to invest in its future. The strategies were designed in order to address these problems but the situation is getting worse. There are various reasons for this situation: a lack of appropriate infrastructure, insufficient private and public investments, delays in the development of innovative technologies and inappropriate vocational training and education.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs a clear vision for a more competitive economy. To be in line with the employment and growth objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, structural changes are required: support for R&amp;D, encouragement of private and public investments, development of innovative actions for sectors such as biotechnologies, sustainable energies and ICTs. Besides the structural changes and the development of innovative sectors, environmental protection and the quality of products must remain, within the framework of global economy, a genuine European specificity.
