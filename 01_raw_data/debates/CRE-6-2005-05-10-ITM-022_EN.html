<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karl-Heinz Florenz (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Schmit, Commissioner, it is true – climate policy matters not only to the European Union, but also to the world as a whole, and attention to that policy is for that reason a global task.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we press on with discussion of the Kyoto issue, though, Europe should ask itself what targets it has set itself and which of them it has achieved. Or perhaps the other way round: which targets must we set ourselves for the future, and by what means can we achieve them? Have we, in the whole Kyoto debate, managed to involve those countries that have not signed the Kyoto Protocol? Morally, at any rate, the Kyoto treaty is binding upon all of us, for we all share in responsibility for the policies we adopt with regard to this planet’s climate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that I would like the Council and the Commission to tell us how they are preparing for this new step post-2012, and whether they are willing to take the initiative in finding new shoulders to bear the burdens of Kyoto. Are you, then, looking for other partners and participants in this process as a whole? The countries I have in mind are, of course, India, China, Brazil and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">If this House believes that this or that country can be induced to make progress by threatening it with a court summons, then it is, in my view, making a mistake. Only if all the arguments are in your favour and beyond reasonable doubt should you haul someone before the courts. It strikes me as preferable by far, and as a more promising course of action, to get these countries into a situation in which they have to make a move, and to motivate them to stop sulking and making excuses for each other, and instead to say, ‘yes, we do have a shared responsibility’.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, there is another question I would like to revisit, and it is that of to what degree you are able and willing not only to involve other countries and actively engage in dialogue with them, but also other sectors as well. I am thinking, for example, of transport policy, the heating of private homes ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Oh yes, that is something we have long been calling for, but you have never paid any attention. All these sectors, then, need to be involved. There is no doubt that there will be trouble; that is why, when I told the German minister for the environment – who is one of your party-political allies – that he should ask for that, his reply was that he could not do that, for if he did, he would lose his seat in no time. It is precisely for that reason, though, that he should do it, so, Commissioner, which sectors do you want to include?</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we have to have the courage to tackle heating in private homes – along with all the other things in our homes that give off heat and account for over one third of all CO2 emissions. How far are you prepared to go in highlighting new ways of dealing with this?</p>
<p class="contents">The examples are very simple, but, rather than trying to apply one standard to all, what we have to give the partners who will join us in Kyoto is targets, leaving it to them to find their own ways of reaching them. Who, after all, would have believed that the Federal Republic of Germany, to take one example, would, by means of a well thought-out waste policy, have saved 21 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over the last 15 years? We can, though, do a lot if we are willing to motivate these countries to get stuck into this.</p>
<p class="contents">Just by way of a final observation, why is there no longer any reference to agriculture in all this? By this, I do not mean punishments for this sector – that is the Greens’ policy, which I have always thought misguided – but to motivating it. Nowhere is it written that farmers must plant only root crops, cereals, rape or vines; they could equally well grow genetically or biologically modified plants that absorb large quantities of CO2 and return it to the atmosphere only in small quantities when burned later on. Here too, then, there are lots of opportunities for the future and scope for being imaginative.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would urge both you and the President-in-Office of the Council to be pro-active and optimistic when tackling this issue, so that we may be able, for our children’s sake, to take the necessary steps at long last towards making this continent safe where CO2 emissions are concerned.</p>

I believe Europe has become a real leader in this field. We have managed to show the way by applying the Kyoto Protocol, but we also know that we cannot stop there, that we must continue to develop the policies we have implemented on the basis of the Kyoto Protocol. And while we must join with our partners to find solutions internationally, we must also, as you so rightly said, find solutions at home. As the March European Council showed, I think climate change is indeed a major challenge for Europe, as it is for all the industrialised and industrialising nations, but it also offers our industries new possibilities and prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">To speak of the European economy being competitive certainly does not mean that industry need not rise to this challenge. It is quite clear that Europe is also capable of exploiting its role as an engine to become an industrial power in development technologies, especially in the realm of alternative energies; when it comes to energy savings, Europe can consolidate its leading position and benefit more economically by cooperating with other partners, countries like China in particular, which is beginning to attach greater importance to these questions for a variety of reasons, especially reasons of climate. I therefore believe that competitiveness and environmental protection are entirely compatible, as are competitiveness and a solution to the climate problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also agrees with a number of the analyses Parliament makes in its resolution on the subject, and the seminar of government experts is an important occasion here: it is in a way a new stage in the development of a future climate regime for the years after 2012. At this seminar, the parties will exchange views on present policies and initiatives and on the future adjustments that will have to be made to alleviate the problem of climate change. The European Union’s contribution to this seminar is therefore an important part of its strategy with a view to formal negotiations to draw up a post-Kyoto regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council which met on 22 and 23 March 2005, and of which I have already spoken in connection with relaunching the Lisbon strategy, has already adopted some key elements which will be essential for designing the future climate regime. It confirmed that, if the essential target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to be met, the increase in the global annual average surface temperature must not be more than 2ºC above pre-industrial levels. It also welcomed the Commission communication entitled ‘Winning the battle against global climate change’ and in that connection clearly emphasised the need to give fresh impetus to international negotiations by exploring options for a post-2012 regime and ensuring the widest possible cooperation of all countries. It also stressed the need to develop a medium- and long-term EU strategy that will be compatible with the 2°C target and in that respect I believe that it answers all the concerns you have voiced and that it takes on board the suggested solutions for the various sectors to which you referred.</p>
<p class="contents">During a visit by the troika to the United States on 18 and 19 April 2005, which I think the Commissioner may speak about, agreement was reached to explore ways of relaunching the EU-US High-Level Group’s activities in order to examine policies for fighting climate change. I can tell you that the President of the United States assured the President-in-Office of the European Council that the United States was going to adopt a more open and more sensitive approach to these problems. Contacts with other key parties involved in the climate change process, and I will mention China and India in particular, will be made in the months ahead. The issue of climate change also figures prominently on the agenda for the G8 and I know that the forthcoming British Presidency considers this problem one of its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament certainly has an important part to play in our joint efforts to reach an agreement on a future climate regime. The Council is very interested in Parliament’s position on the post-2012 framework. It also hopes that Parliament will continue to take part in international meetings. The Council also invites Parliament to assist it in heightening the awareness of European public opinion and of national parliaments in the European Union and elsewhere. It is not in fact rare to meet in other parliamentary fora MPs of countries that are concerned by this problem, a problem which ought to concern us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First I wish to thank the chairman, Mr Florenz, for giving us this opportunity to debate climate change and, in particular, the strategy of the European Union for the seminar of government experts on climate change due to meet in Bonn next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Parliament's opinion that the seminar is a very timely step in working out the future arrangements with regard to climate change. The European Union's contribution to this seminar therefore constitutes an important part of our strategy, the aim of which is to obtain a mandate to open official negotiations on the development of these arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">On 9 February, the Commission approved its communication entitled 'Winning the battle against global climate change'. This communication, which is also addressed to the European Parliament, contains the Commission's initial recommendations on the European Union's strategy after 2012. Basic elements of the communication in question were adopted by the Environment Council on 11 March and by the European Council on 22-23 March, as Mr Schmit mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from defining the elements which will comprise future arrangements, the communication also lists specific steps which need to be taken in the direction of these arrangements. First in importance is the need to investigate, jointly with basic partners and during the current year, both the potential for a strategy after 2012 and the shaping of a favourable climate for opening official negotiations on future arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Three weeks ago, as Mr Schmit said, I and my colleagues from Luxembourg and the United Kingdom visited the United States and the outcome of these truly constructive talks, as you acknowledged Mr Florenz, because we had discussed all this beforehand, was the agreement to find ways of restarting, of reactivating the EU/US high-level group, with a view to examining policies to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also scheduled contacts with other countries over coming months. Climate change is also high on the agenda of the G8 Group, while I personally have already held unofficial talks with my counterparts representing our basic partners both within the framework of meetings of the G8 Group and at the United Nations during talks on sustainable development. We met, either jointly with Mr Lux and Lord Whitty or separately, with representatives, with ministers from China, Brazil, Spain, South Africa, Australia and Russia and got their initial reactions. Unfortunately, we were unable to meet the Indian minister, despite the fact that we tried both in England to achieve a meeting at the meetings held by the G8 Group and in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are strengthening numerous informal contacts and talks at a technical level.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the seminar of government experts is concerned, this is an important opportunity to broaden these contacts at the level in question through open dialogue within the framework of the United Nations convention on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission's strategy, the objective of the European Union for the seminar is to create a climate of trust, to discuss and look for common ground and to send out appropriate messages, not just to the United States, but also to all the global partners. I should point out here that many countries are hiding – at least they have been hiding until now – behind the refusal of the United States, in order to avoid discussing the question of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will not do likewise. It will send out appropriate messages by presenting our opinions and endeavouring to obtain the opinions of others on the topical issues raised in the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to agree with Mr Florenz that we also need to include other sectors, if we are to be able to combat climate change more effectively, including in the transport sector. As we said earlier, the Commission is preparing a communication for next June on the question of air transport, the contribution of which to greenhouse gas emissions is increasing constantly. We are examining three alternative solutions: tax, inclusion in the gas trading system or user charges.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we must say that the new agricultural policy supports the production of biofuels and, of course, the housing sector and the construction sector in general are very important sectors in which we can achieve important results.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that Parliament is being called on to play an important part in our efforts to achieve an agreement on future arrangements with regard to climate. The Commission is particularly interested in your opinions on the problems and on the recommendations for the European Union's strategy, as presented in our communication. I also anticipate that your active participation and cooperation at international conferences will continue. Moreover, I call for Parliament's support in further raising the awareness of the public in the European Union and of your parliamentary counterparts in other countries. You did a very good job in Buenos Aires and I want this work to continue with the same demands on the part of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in itself extremely positive that you radiate a certain optimism regarding this difficult issue, both where the problem as a whole is concerned and, specifically, when it comes to your reading of Bush. I wish I could be just as optimistic. Just the other day, George W Bush gave a speech on energy and climate change that unfortunately did not show any real movement in the right direction. I of course agree with you, however, that the dialogue with the United States is incredibly important because, without its active participation, the work on climate change can never be properly effective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, just as important to engage in dialogue – and dialogue of a strategic nature – with large developing countries such as China and India. I saw the other day that China anticipates building 800 large coal-fired power stations over the next ten years. The emissions from these will completely overshadow what we do in Europe. The conclusion is, of course, that the developing countries need not go down precisely the same route in energy development as we have done. They need not repeat our mistakes, and it is in the interests of all of us to offer them favourable conditions for investing in the best possible technology. On this point, I am unfortunately compelled to note that the CDM, that is to say the Clean Development Mechanism, is not enough. Instead, we must come up with something much more radical and ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is serious, with the latest research reports in fact indicating that the climate system may be much more vulnerable than we had previously believed. It will be much more difficult to stay within the two-degree increase in temperature established by the EU as an objective and to avoid dangerous climate change. That is why the summit in Bonn is so important, for you will be able to lay a foundation for the period following 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution indicates the need for short- and long-term emissions objectives. We also think that such objectives need to be accompanied by far more ambitious programmes in terms both of the development of new energy sources and increased investment in energy efficiency. There is a range of issues in this area to which we must return and in connection with which we must together devise practical objectives. I wish the Commission and the Council good luck in Bonn and hope that you will come back with positive reports so that we can do this work in a way that is constructive for the future and, as Mr Florenz pointed out, accept our responsibility for future generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, global warming is materialising much quicker than anticipated. We are faced with the dual task of adapting to climate change and, at the same time, of keeping it to an absolute minimum. In the light of this enormous challenge, the outcome of the Climate Conference in Buenos Aires was particularly disappointing. It is, of course, good that a seminar managed to keep the Kyoto process on the rails, if only just, and that the EU had its own way and that next week’s seminar in Bonn will be about future developments, but this is a shamefully poor result. We have to conclude that the EU is becoming ever more isolated, and that the urgency that is felt in Europe is not shared in other parts of the world. The EU will need to be constructive in Bonn if a much stronger international coalition is to be built up, and sound, productive and well-founded proposals will have to be tabled there.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to put to you four points which, in our view, can help achieve a constructive, international coalition.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must put far more work into adaptation and help others, certainly developing countries, to adapt. Adaptation is certainly not simple, but aid should definitely not be restricted to major disasters. As lifestyle adaptation is far-reaching, credible programmes must be written.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the transfer of technology, which has already been mentioned by Mr Wijkman, we must abandon our ideological reservations about the mechanism for clean development and go all out for investment in technology transfer, concentrating on further research and development in the area of environmental technology, to which subject I will gladly return during the debate on the seventh framework programme for research.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we will need to focus far less on the national approach and objectives within each country, but far more on sectoral objectives. In the discussions we held as parliamentary delegation in Buenos Aires, a sectoral approach emerged as a viable route. We will need to enter into dialogue with the steel, cement and paper industries. I regard aviation as a sector to which priority should be given. In all these sectors, competition is worldwide, so it is obvious that worldwide objectives should be established based on the best available technology. Moreover, a sectoral approach is ideally suited to our Lisbon strategy, which was reviewed during the last spring summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although it is more controversial for me to say this, I would ask you to consider the role that the WTO can play. The European Union must open the discussion on trade measures against countries that fail to meet their climate obligation. In that case, green trade policy is not directed against developing countries but against the richer countries, which can, in fact, result in help for developing countries. Commissioner, we expect from the European Union an international climate policy with ambition and with the largest possible international support base in other countries, industry and among the public. I wish you much success in Bonn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are still some who wish to deny it, but we cannot allow ourselves to conceal the seriousness of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change derives from a two-fold shortage: the physical scarcity of energy resources and the inability of the ecosystem to absorb the flow of waste. It must be pointed out, in actual fact, that, as extreme events become worse, climate change creates considerable threats for the region, which must be tackled immediately. In the present context, greater security provisions are required: the Kyoto Protocol is only the first answer; we must move forward and provide a systematic solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the issue of energy production that is at stake, but also the consumption habits of our society. What scares me most are the statements emerging from the United States, according to which their standard of living cannot be called into question. On the contrary, such a reappraisal is the very first thing that we must make possible in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the knowledge-based society seriously additionally means changing our way of life in an ever more radical way, and ensuring that our development is sustainable. We must seek to progress in the work of involving other countries, persuading them that we are indeed faced with the duty of transforming our society.</p>
<p class="contents">We must emerge from the age of fossil fuels, and the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step; we must go beyond this and work in earnest, because we must radically alter the ways of our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some time ago, an article in the British magazine, <span class="italic">New Scientist</span>, expressed astonishment at decision-makers who view the warnings of climate researchers with indifference. The magazine asked whether political decision-makers thought they lived in an alternative universe where the laws of nature did not apply, and went on to say that no one would ever view a risk of economic collapse so nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="contents">After Kyoto, we will need bolder cuts in emissions and more countries to be involved. We will also need to involve major economically developing countries, such as China and India. Above all, however, it is the biggest polluter, the United States of America, which ought to recognise its responsibility. It is pointless trying to imagine the involvement of China and India if the richest country on earth remains a free-rider. The industrialised countries have to acknowledge their historical responsibility for the fact that climate change has begun generally, and, accordingly, it is we who have the main responsibility to cut emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries which have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol are trying to gain an unfair competitive edge. We should seriously think about whether we can, for example, impose protective tariffs on imports into Europe of steel produced in the United States. The rules of the World Trade Organisation make this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the voice of reason is also being heard in the United States. Many states there have decided to take action. The north-eastern states are starting to engage in carbon dioxide emissions trading, and want to be part of the European Union emissions trading scheme. A number of city mayors have committed themselves to action at local level, and they are seeking the involvement of 141 cities, which is the same as the number of countries that have ratified Kyoto. Since, however, mere reason does not appear to be enough to persuade the United States to bear global responsibility, the kind of action possible under WTO rules ought to be seriously considered.</p>

In February, four members of our group attended the IPCC’s Climate Conference in La Réunion where we were shocked by the conclusions of the scientists that had gathered there. Even if we resorted to all the measures listed in the resolution, we would not be able to resolve the problem of climate change entirely.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we make every possible effort in the framework of Kyoto until 2050, we will still not be able to stop the earth from warming up by two degrees and the sea level from rising by half a metre. I happen to come from the Netherlands, the Low Countries, so you can imagine that this causes me some considerable anxiety. If the sea level increases by half a metre, large parts of my country will flood if nothing is done about it. The coastline as we know it will disappear. The Hague will disappear into the sea and with it, the embassies of all the countries represented here today, our government buildings, the International Court of Justice, the Yugoslavia Tribunal and the Palace of our Queen. We may, as a party, be republican, but we do not want to achieve our goals by submerging the royal palace.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the Netherlands has the technical capacity to prevent this from happening, but many other countries do not. The disappearance of whole swathes of coastline is inevitable. We should prepare for that eventuality, and I would therefore urge the Commission to form an opinion on this. It can make a start during the forthcoming seminar which will be attended by government experts. I would ask the Commission at least to stand by its own measures and directives, including those for air quality. Since these measures are now beginning to take shape in a concrete manner, opposition from some Member States or sectors will increase and there will be a call for moderation, something that we oppose, and we would ask you, Parliament and the Council, to stand firm.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also urge you not to opt for a step forward, for more nuclear energy, but instead to choose for the development of all possible alternatives, and we would ask you to stick to the text of the resolution so that the EU can continue to play its pioneering role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has noted that this change mainly affects the world’s poor people. I wish to emphasise this, because we in this House too often see global problems from a one-sided European perspective. The reasons why it is mainly poor people who experience the effects of global climate change are many. They partly have to do with the fact that these countries’ economies are often dominated by climate-sensitive industries, especially agriculture. They also have few resources with which to adapt to, and protect themselves against, various changes, for example rising sea levels or reduced rainfall. There are also too few resources for preventive healthcare. It is thus difficult to eradicate the risk of climate-related diseases, such as malaria, from breaking out.</p>
<p class="contents">The world’s rich countries need to coordinate their common efforts in combating climate change and to work in particular with preventive measures. My party believes that the EU should work on cross-border environmental issues. Climate change is among these. I thus support constructive and well thought-out proposals by the EU in this area. At the same time, I wish to emphasise that the UN Climate Convention<span class="bold"> </span>has<span class="bold"> </span>been ratified by<span class="bold"> </span>189 parties. Thus, we cannot operate unilaterally through European institutions. We need instead also to coordinate our measures within the frameworks of other international organisations and to be alert to the UN’s competent bodies and the World Energy Council (WEC). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not possible to enter here into the scientific merits of the theory that our planet is undergoing climate change on a geological time scale – a theory about which researchers are not in agreement – partly because of the limitations of meteorological observations in time and space.

<p class="contents">Assuming that the rise in temperature is recognised as being, at least in part, attributable to human activity, we agree that application of the Kyoto Protocol on the widest scale is a worthwhile and necessary attempt to limit such effects. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to encourage absolute compliance with the Protocol within the EU, and to examine every possible means of exerting political and economic pressure on countries that have not adopted said Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the previous speakers that the United States of America, China, India, Brazil and other countries need to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is equally important that the right guidelines be given, so that policy and progress to limit emissions of greenhouse gases can be formulated and addressed in the long term. I was delighted to hear the Commissioner talk about a strategy after 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy must take account of the increased needs of our planet and of the pressure caused both by the population increase and our various manmade activities.

<p class="contents">We need to promote this policy not only at European Union level, but also at global level.

Measures to moderate and adjust must also be based, over and above the aspect of the cost of productivity, on meeting future challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">With this objective, the seminar is seen as useful in identifying the factors which currently impose the greatest burden on the environment and, consequently, in promoting the necessary environmental technologies and innovations to mitigate these harmful repercussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I really hope that you are right in your analysis and that things are moving in the right direction. I should also like to thank Mr Wijkman for his work on the resolution we shall later be voting on. In common with many others here in the House, I share the view that the conference involving government experts is an extremely welcome development, even though I also wish to emphasise that it cannot replace summits at a higher political level, for it sometimes feels as if we have a very great deal of knowledge but that we lack the political will to do more to get on top of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this conference can contribute to drawing attention to positive examples of the way in which the effect on climate can be reduced, especially when it comes to social planning, for it sometimes feels as if climate issues are only regarded as a peripheral environmental issue for those with a special interest in it. It is extremely important, however, that we integrate this approach into all of our social structuring and social planning, for it will only be then that we shall be able to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the conference will include discussion of ways of integrating measures designed to reduce effects upon climate and bring about sustainable development into the WTO’s trade system, as well as into other international agreements. That is what is needed if more countries are to adopt the measures required, but rules of that type could also help reduce the number of those shipments that at present play such a big part in causing major climate problems.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, for example, fish are hauled out of the Baltic and North Sea, transported by ’plane to Asia and packaged as ready-made meals which are then transported back and sold in the same places as the fish were landed. Shipments of that type cannot make economic sense or be in any way sustainable, and we must ensure that the economy is partly driven in a manner that makes it unprofitable to transport food in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, good luck with the conference, and do your best to let it be known that the EU is in actual fact doing something in this area. We do need to do something. We need to show our electorates and citizens that we are in actual fact doing something about the greatest challenge we face, namely climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that the demands upon us are increasing and that the measures we need to take to reduce emissions by 60 to 80% by 2050 – which is a realistic figure – will require quite different energy and transport policies than those we have at present. We have, then, really only just begun.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are used to saying in this House that we are better than the United States, as indeed we are, but that is not of course something that it is particularly difficult to be in the present situation. We saw in Buenos Aires how, at present, the United States does not only refuse to accept its own share of responsibility but also tries actively to prevent global cooperation in the climate sphere. That is why it is even more important that the EU dare to conduct a consistent policy involving far-reaching objectives. I also believe that the nation that, in the end, will be the main loser in this situation, not only ecologically but also economically, will be the United States itself because its outmoded and cumbersome energy and transport systems will force it to make even more rapid and more comprehensive adjustments further down the line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a tough statement, I readily admit. It should be borne in mind, however, that no one is being condemned to having sanctions imposed on them here: we are simply proposing that the possibility should be investigated for the future. For this we shall need new opening gambits and moves, and bold ones too, in the debate on climate policy. I therefore ask whether we should not take the step that would make free-riding impossible and uncomfortable. Hopefully, the weaknesses of the Kyoto Protocol will also reveal themselves to us, so that we might learn a lesson, and so that by 2012 we might have much more effective weapons to fight climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to admit that Kyoto has now reached an impasse, as the global front is inadequate, partly because there are no limits for developing countries, and partly because the major polluters are on the outside. That makes Kyoto ineffective and causes the distortion of competition and carbon leakage. Even if we did all we could in the EU, it has been estimated that in future decades the proportion of emissions from the 25 EU countries will drop to below 10%, while developing countries will increase their share to over half of all emissions. Unless the front is made wider, the efforts of the EU will come to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Not even the EU, however, will be safe from my WTO amendment, if it does not succeed in fulfilling its commitments. Political decisions and rhetoric in the EU are now in a good state, certainly, but practical development is becoming a problem. Progress in the reduction of emissions in the EU has come to a halt, as the easiest action to make cuts has been taken. Nine of the fifteen old Member States have exceeded their own Kyoto targets by more than 20%. Unless we can think of something radical, there is a danger that we too will have to recognise the hopelessness of the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware that the issue of climate change deserves our full attention and must be fully integrated into our policies. It is also the reason why the Luxembourg Presidency made sustainable development one of its major priorities, together, as part of the sustainable development strategy, with everything more specifically concerned with climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, Europe is showing leadership in this field and must continue to do so. That will certainly be the case under the British Presidency. Europe must make its voice heard loud and clear on the international scene. Ultimately, I believe, no country will be able to avoid the obvious constraints that apply to us all in this regard, and if Europe continues to play its part on climate change, I think it will also succeed in winning over those who seem the most hesitant today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the merits and weaknesses, the advantages and disadvantages of being an optimist or pessimist, as suggested by Mr Wijkman and Mrs Westlund, on this issue one should not be an optimist or pessimist but a realist. We must try to work with all those who realise the importance of the problem, that the problem is a global one and needs a global solution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the United States, mentioned by Mr Sjöstedt, Mrs Hassi and Mrs Korhola among others, I have to tell you that during our discussions with the United States authorities, we were very clear that we consider that cooperation in research and development of new technologies and the deployment of new technologies is very important, but we are not going to consider this a first step forward because it is something on which we in any case agree. No-one disagrees that we should use new technologies, as Mr Trakatellis said. We should deploy new technologies in order to fight climate change. That is something we have agreed. We should make progress. It is not progress if they agree at the G-8 or anywhere else that we will cooperate on development. That is not enough. We should take steps forward. That was made very clear to the United States because, as we correctly said earlier, other countries will refuse to cooperate and, after a few years, the developing countries of South Asia and South America and other developing countries will contribute more to the greenhouse phenomenon than the European Union and the United States combined. We need all countries to cooperate, to be on board. We will follow a common but differentiated policy because we cannot ask developing countries to contribute towards the reduction of emissions as much as the developed countries that have contributed far more up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises the need for the European Union to maintain its leading role in international and also domestic efforts to fight climate change, as Mr Trakatellis said. The Commission highlighted in its communication of 9 February ‘Winning the battle against climate change’ that we should focus on leadership by example. Mr Prodi said that we have a moral duty to do so. One of the central recommendations was that the European Council should give a clear message that the European Union wishes to engage with other countries in an open dialogue on what further multilateral action is required to address the challenge of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Targets were mentioned. They have proved to be a very useful tool in environmental policy-making. They provide clear guidance to decision-makers in society. They are particularly useful to industry in the private sector. Thus, targets will continue to be a core element of any future climate policy regime. However, the timing of targets is very important. The exact timing should depend on the progress we make in building international support for starting negotiations on the future climate change regime. Once we have a mandate to start such negotiations, the European Union will need to consider putting forward the targets it is willing to set for the post-2012 period.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to respond to the suggestion made by several speakers that the European Union should use trade measures to protect our industry or other measures to offset the competitive advantages of companies in countries that do not restrict their greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union’s climate policy has been carefully designed to minimise costs to industry. That is the reason we opted for emissions trading. Our goal should be to work towards a future climate regime that is not only a decisive step in winning our battle against climate change, but also allows us to do so in a way that strengthens our competitiveness in clean technologies. Such a regime will get us much further – also in climate terms – than trade sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the developing countries, I agree about the importance of assisting developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. The European Union is the main contributor to the 2001 Bonn Political Declaration, which pledges USD 410 million per year in climate change funding for developing countries, starting this year. An important part of this will go to support adaptation measures. The European Union is also the main contributor to the Least Developed Countries Fund. Those countries have to face all the consequences of climate change, but they are not in a position to take the measures needed to adapt properly. It is our moral duty to work with them and help them. It is also in our interests, because in this way they will also contribute to reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline the importance of developing and deploying new technologies, including in developing countries. The Commission is identifying and implementing concrete actions. The Commission recently agreed with China on the setting-up of two new European Union-China action plans in the area of energy: one on clean coal and the other on renewable energy and energy efficiency for which the Commission has secured initial funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the Bonn seminar and the forthcoming negotiations on the future international climate change regime. I am confident that Parliament will, as usual, play an important part in this debate. The Commission and Parliament have always been strong allies in this respect. I look forward to working with you in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
