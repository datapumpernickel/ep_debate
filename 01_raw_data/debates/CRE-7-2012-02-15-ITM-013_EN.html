<p class="contents">The EU condemns the totally unacceptable escalation of violence in Syria. The time has come to speak with one voice and demand an end to the bloodshed and a democratic future for Syria. The EU has been leading international calls for strong UN action. We are very disappointed, as you all are, by the recent failure of the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution due to Russia and China’s renewed veto. Last Saturday, following the vote, the High Representative once again stressed that the EU will continue to support all efforts by the League of Arab States and called once more on all members of the UN Security Council to assume their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian crisis is, and will remain, very high on the EU agenda. EU foreign ministers will discuss it again on 27 February. The EU has, throughout the conflict, stood by the Syrian people and the High Representative continues to increase pressure on the Syrian authorities through multiple levels. The urgent priority for now is to stop the regime’s repression and the escalating violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Arab League’s plan, it is also essential that the regime frees political detainees, removes troops, tanks and weapons from the cities and allows independent observers and the media to freely travel and report in Syria. To this end, the EU is intensively engaged with the League of Arab States and other players to find a peaceful solution. The High Representative has stressed the key role of regional involvement and Arab League leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">On the diplomatic front, Catherine Ashton has been speaking to Secretary-General El-Arabi to discuss the next steps and express our political support for the efforts that the Arab League is undertaking to solve the Syrian crisis. She has also spoken to the Secretary-General of the UN Ban Ki-moon, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Davutoğlu and several other leaders with the same objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU welcomes the League of Arab States’ efforts to increase international pressure on the Syrian regime. Leadership of the Arab League is key. Due to the escalation of violence against the Syrian population, the League decided on 12 February to end its observation mission. It asked the UN Security Council to issue a resolution to form a joint Arab-UN peacekeeping force to supervise the implementation of a ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arab League has also decided to enforce the economic sanctions of previous resolutions of the Arab League and agreed on a meeting of Friends of Syria to take place in Tunisia on 24 February. We welcome this development. The Tunis meeting will provide a timely opportunity to build an international consensus on Syria and put forward urgent proposals to stop the killings and to seek a peaceful outcome to the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the EU and the High Representative will take an active part in this endeavour. The High Representative has also offered EU expertise in the area of sanctions and has stressed the need to coordinate closely in the dialogue with opposition groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on the UN front must go on. We continue to seek the support of partners so that the Security Council can come back to this issue in due course and agree on a strong resolution on Syria. The High Representative is making the case rapidly with members of the Security Council and regional partners to achieve this goal. The EU message to Russia and China is clear: they should not be on the wrong side of history.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has a responsibility to stop the regime’s killing machine. Last Monday, during a debate at the United Nations General Assembly on the situation in Syria, a vast majority of UN Member States condemned the widespread violation of human rights by the regime. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her assessment, said that the Assad regime had ‘manifestly failed’ to fulfil its obligation to protect its population and had engaged in crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Human Rights Council at its upcoming session should also take appropriate action on Syria. The EU is ready to mobilise assistance to relieve the hardship of the Syrian population. The Commission is preparing a contingency plan in the area of humanitarian assistance. While bilateral cooperation with the Syrian regime is entirely suspended, the Commission and the External Action Service continue to support projects to the benefit of NGOs, Syrian civil society organisations and human rights defenders, as well as Palestinian refuges.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Syria requires that the EU must maintain a presence through its Member State missions and the EU delegation as the Syrian opposition is asking us to do. Not only to observe and report on the situation, but also to signal clearly that the regime cannot repress its population in total impunity and the Syrian people will not be left alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Close coordination among the EU missions in Damascus is taking place also with respect to contingency planning. Similarly, actions are being undertaken with respect to the neighbouring countries. Last but not least, the EU continues to engage with Syrian opposition groups. It is essential to encourage them to strengthen their coordination and develop a common vision on the way forward in order to convince the Syrian population of the value of their cause and to promote an orderly and peaceful transition in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative has offered the EU’s support to the Arab League in its efforts towards bringing together the Syrian opposition groups and their common vision for the transition. I would also like to thank you, honourable Members, for your support in the past months. The valued statements made in the European Parliament and the resolutions adopted by this House have helped the EU to shape its policy towards Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we maintain pressure on the Syrian regime. The European Parliament has a key role in ensuring that the Syrian people are not left alone in their struggle. The High Representative is committed to continuing to work with you on joint efforts to support the Arab League and to stop the ongoing violence. Syria will be at the core of her meeting in Washington at the end of this week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, a kind of cold war between Saudi Arabia and, currently, Iran, which is becoming apparent on several fronts, and specifically in Syria at the moment, then, what is clearly a domino effect from the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, and finally, a greater desire on the part of China and Russia and other players in the Middle East conflict to make their presence felt and to fill the vacuum left by the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have followed the High Representative’s actions with a great deal of interest: suspension of development aid, humanitarian help, a contingency plan, the tightening of sanctions at the next Council of Ministers on 27 February, and support to the Arab League initiative. A more effective and coordinated diplomatic response from the Member States of the European Union was lacking, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, none of those decisions has led to a short-term reduction in the intolerable violence that is being suffered by the Syrian people, hence the frustration we all share. The French Foreign Minister expressed that view today during an appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in relation to the failure of the initiative and the Russian and Chinese vetoes in the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">An initiative from Qatar and Saudi Arabia is being debated in the General Assembly as we speak, with the specific aim of ratifying the agreement, even though we know that it does not have any binding effects.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do about this situation? Increase the pressure on Russia and China, certainly. Two very appropriate occasions for doing so have arisen recently: one was the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China to the United States, where he was received with full honours, and, of course, the EU-China Summit that has just taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that we have to strengthen our relationship with the Syrian dissidents, and we have to see how this humanitarian corridor they have requested can be established and developed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is clear is that the questions the Foreign Ministers of the Arab League asked themselves the other day also apply to us. How long are we going to remain impassive towards the violence that the Syrian people are currently suffering? Also, what is our tolerance limit when deadline after deadline passes, initiatives come and go, and the regime continues butchering the Syrian people?</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief, Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service, that this is the key issue to be considered in today’s debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Véronique De Keyser, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, this is the fourth Parliamentary resolution on Syria and I would say that the added value of this resolution which, of course, hardens the tone and supports the diplomatic efforts, one of the added values is just to say to the people of Syria, ‘No, even if nothing is happening, you are not forgotten. Even if the same thing is repeated all of the time, you are not forgotten!’ That, in itself, is of some worth.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I should like to say to you is that this resolution, as with the speeches that I have heard, does not address the essential questions: in other words, what are we doing; what strategy is being followed? Not a military strategy, I agree. I believe that would be the worst thing to have.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, however, a member of the Syrian National Council, who had tears in his eyes as he showed me the videos of his country where dreadful torture is taking place, asked me: are you going to give us arms? Are you going to give us money? We are not asking you to intervene on our behalf, but are you going to help us? We want to fight our own fight. Are you capable of that?</p>
<p class="contents">I said that it is not even in the resolution, because I have been told that the Syrian opposition is not united enough, that we do not have the correct channels, and so on. However, if we fail to answer this key question, what credibility are we going to have? I am therefore asking you to draw up these answers. I am not asking to have them here, and I am not asking you, or you, to have them, but I would say to you that this is what is expected. The country is awaiting practical things from us too.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing I wish to say concerns Bashar al-Assad. Although there are perhaps only a few of us, some of us have long felt that it would be possible to change the Syrian regime. We have met the Syrian President, some of us at length and sometimes in person, for an hour or an hour and a half; I recall having been in Bashar al-Assad’s apartment, where he told me how his country had to change: the state of emergency, multi-party politics and so on. We were duped. Today, when I hear promises of a new constitution, I say to myself that we believed all of those promises.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not asking for Bashar al-Assad’s head on a pike. I still feel ill for having seen Saddam Hussein hanged and for having seen the battered head of Gaddafi. I do say, however, that he will be held to account for his acts. We shall not let this pass. The International Criminal Court exists to try crimes against humanity. With that, I say to the Syrian people: ‘Wait, we are going to do something’. I am really asking here for the Council and the Commission to work on practical measures, and I would ask Parliament to support this position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is good – but let us be honest, colleagues: what is the strategy that we will defend there?</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell you, Minister, I did not hear it. You have given here the strategy and the request of the Arab League, but what is the strategy of the European Union? What is the current strategy towards Syria? We are in the middle of this crisis; we have the problems around Homs, which is clearly a second Srebrenica. We are in the middle of a war at the moment in Syria. I am asking you here: what is the strategy? It is not enough to say: OK, we will be there on the 24th in Tunisia. But what will we say there? What is our position on the main issues? The main issues are whether we are in favour of humanitarian intervention in Syria, creating safe zones and no-fly zones on the border with Turkey and on the border with Jordan, and having corridors there. Are we in favour of that? Yes or no? I think they are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">There is currently genocide in Syria. That is what is happening, and if we do not stop it with the international community, it can only continue. What we are seeing today is the second Hama.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is whether we should give material and technical help to the Syrian opposition and to the Free Syrian Army. I think we have to give such help, and if it proves necessary at a particular time, weapon sales will be necessary – maybe not directly; we might arrange it through our colleagues in the Arab League. But what is the European Union’s answer? Do we give material help: yes or no? They need it desperately.</p>
<p class="contents">My third question to you is: what is happening with the sanction regime? We have known from the beginning that our list was too small and that at least 200 families in the regime of Bashar al-Assad have to be targeted. We started with 20, and then 30 and then 35 and then 40: that is the way we are going, targeting only the individuals and not the families. So my question is: are we now going to have a sanction regime which really targets the 200 big families?</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth issue was mentioned by Mr Salafranca: what shall we do about Russia and China? We have the opportunity possibly to say something to them about this matter. We had a mission to China, and we are currently promising them the status of a free market economy – this at a time when they are refusing to take their responsibility in the Security Council. Is it the right time to do that? I do not think so. We have to wait until they have said yes to an intervention in Syria – which is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to hear from you the position of the European Union, and I want you to tell me what you told us a few minutes ago. There will be a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs on 27th; that you have said. The 27th is three days after the 24th. I think you should have your meeting before Ms Ashton goes there. I think we are making exactly the same mistake we made in places like Libya, among others.</p>

<p class="contents">We only need to see how public hospitals have now been transformed into centres of torture, execution and kidnapping. Given that, I will not list the considerable number of people injured, the number of people who have disappeared, the number of detainees or the number of deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Human Rights Council got it right when it said that we are dealing here with crimes against humanity. Ms De Keyser is right: Assad will have to account for his crimes before the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this terror, I sincerely wish to salute the courage, determination and the incredible capacity for resistance shown by organised civil society in Syria as, despite everything, the food arrives, despite everything, information is exchanged, despite everything, protection is provided for those who demonstrate. Despite everything, medical care is provided in living rooms that have been transformed into emergency hospitals. I believe that the channels that are in place are precarious and dangerous. We should discuss and work to see how we might now intensify the movement of goods, care, food and protection via these informal channels, how we can make it secure, stronger and broader, how we can protect those who are risking their lives to move these goods.</p>
<p class="contents">This, I feel, is the first way to give practical help, which is what we are calling for. Obviously, sanctions must be strengthened and it is necessary, above all, to ensure that they are implemented appropriately. I really do believe that the European Commission and the Council have to ask themselves how a boat laden with arms was able to sail to Syria from a Cypriot port to supply Bashar al-Assad with weapons that he is using against his own people.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the Arab League initiative. Of course, it has to be supported, but vigilance is required too. We are well aware that the Arab League represents a set of extremely diverse interests. We are well aware that the initiatives there are proliferating before the Presidency of the Arab League is taken over by Iraq. All this is well known but, given the situation, the European Union must very clearly define its strategy and be able to deliver it on the 24th in Tunis. It is right that this meeting should take place in Tunis, because it is important. It shows that this story is, first and foremost, the story of a people at the mercy of its oppressor.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking at Syria as a piece on a complicated chessboard and, if we move that piece, we are wondering what the next moves might be. We have to come back to the base of the conflict, of this battle, to support the population. The story unfolding today in Syria is truly that of a society that is struggling for democracy and for rights. Without being naïve, we should see that as the main goal, towards which we should turn all of our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the meeting on 24 February must allow us to isolate or bring on board those countries that currently support the Syrian regime. Of course, there is China and Russia, but there is also Algeria. We must apply maximum pressure to isolate Assad. That is one way to give practical help. We must also recognise the National Council. It has its faults, but we must maintain a political dialogue with it to help it to become the political interlocutor for the future Syria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decision of China and Russia to veto a UN resolution condemning this brutal crackdown and the killing of many unarmed women and children is also shameful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian regime must be unanimously called upon by the international community to withdraw its forces from the cities of Syria, to allow human rights agencies access to the country, and to pave the way for eventual democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish and Saudi condemnation of the regime and, in particular, Turkey’s role in accepting refugees, is commendable. The Arab League should also be congratulated for seeking to end the violence and for producing a new peace plan, which the Syrian regime must implement without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria must be made to guarantee protection for peaceful protesters and uphold the fundamental human right to freedom of expression. This is not possible, in my view, with Assad still in power. He bears ultimate responsibility for any criminal actions of the army, in particular, the most active Alawite units, as many Sunni units are now defecting when deployed militarily. He must recognise the popular rejection of his dictatorship and step aside in the national interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Mr Verhofstadt called for arming the Free Syrian Army. This, in my view, is dangerous at this stage as we do not know who they all are and what role the Jihadis play in this and how this might cause a proxy war with Iran and Hezbollah on one side pouring in arms to the Ba’athist regime and Saudi Arabia and Qatar arming Islamist insurgents, with innocent unarmed Christians, Alawites not allied to the regime and other minorities – from Kurds to the Druze – being caught up in a bloody civil war with major reprisals against non-Sunni Muslims.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I – and my group – would support setting up a safe haven for refugees with a no-fly zone, if eventually militarily possible, near the Turkish border. But even that is not clearly achievable at this stage. However, every other economic sanction against Damascus must be put in place urgently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is there actually a serious alternative to the Assad regime at present? What I mean is, the Syrian opposition appears to be both politically and militarily fragmented. How does the High Representative view the prospect of the collapse of the Syrian state? Does she consider that to be a genuine risk, certainly now that, according to some insiders, the presence of al-Qaeda on Syrian territory can no longer be denied?</p>
<p class="contents">One last question, actually more of a call. Let the European Union, in the first instance, make every possible effort internationally to stop the bloodshed in Syria by forcing the warring factions to the negotiating table.

<p class="contents">The movement which began with a legitimate call for political self-determination and reform has become increasingly radicalised. The women who were initially at the front of the demonstrations are no longer to be seen. Unfortunately, extremists are putting the Syrian revolution at risk. I believe it is ominous that al-Qaeda is calling for a struggle against the Assad regime, as it did in its most recent video message, which demanded an attack on the anti-Islamic government in Damascus.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Islamic extremists, it is a religious duty to oppose the Assad regime. We know what that can lead to: out with the Druze and the Alawites and in with Sharia law. If Islamic fundamentalists and fighters continue to take part in the Syrian uprising or even claim it as their own, it will be a disaster for the democratic, liberal opposition forces in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, military intervention would be the worst possible solution. Only serious dialogue with Assad, who has his back against the wall, can defuse this explosive situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Russians wanted to put the oppressed and the oppressors on an equal footing, condemning both in order – as Mr Lavrov explained – to avoid civil war. The Russian veto is achieving just that. Desperate oppressed people take desperate measures to defend themselves and the country, due to deficiencies of the international community, is heading towards civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran’s support of the Assad regime has an explanation. Through this regime, they can manipulate Hezbollah and Hamas in order to destabilise the region. But the Russian position is perplexing. Let us hope that this is a temporary stance in order to boost the Putin candidacy, using it as domestic bravado for domestic consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s position is a position of principle. We remain faithful to the policy of support for democracy, human rights and to the humanitarian concern about indiscriminate lethal force aimed at unarmed civilians. Our position is the same as with all other Arab Spring countries: we have no hidden agenda, but we cannot remain idle in the face of a massacre of such scale which is tantamount to a crime against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is correctly following and supporting the Arab League’s initiatives and its plan for a political and peaceful transition and for UN-Arab League cooperation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We commend the High Representative’s statement for further sanctions and restrictive measures to be introduced and her intentions to get together with all the other international actors concerned for concerted action to end this intolerable repression.

We will not stop using all available means to push, in the UN General Assembly, in Tunis, or in other fora, for unequivocal condemnations of the Syrian regime, and to pressure Bashar al-Assad to put a stop to the atrocities being committed against his people, to stand down and to allow a process of democratic transition in Syria, as its people clearly desire. We will not rest until we see Bashar al-Assad and his circle brought to justice before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity committed against the Syrian people. We will not cease to encourage EU support for the Arab League and other regional players, whilst striving for the UN Security Council to declare a humanitarian ceasefire, and to assign a peacekeeping force to Syria to implement this humanitarian ceasefire, to help prevent civil war and to pave the way for the transition to democracy. This requires logistical, humanitarian and media support to be stepped up, along with other resources that the EU and its regional partners, such as Turkey, are giving to the forces organising the legitimate resistance of the Syrian people.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also shame China and Russia for opposing the 13 other members of the UN Security Council, thereby preventing the Security Council from exercising its responsibility to protect the Syrian people and, instead, giving the Assad regime licence to continue the massacre. They talk about peace and preventing civil war. However, nothing that they are doing is helping to end the violence. Russia is, in fact, continuing to sell weapons to Bashar al-Assad. This encourages the Syrian armed forces and their supporters in the region, including Wahabi fighters, who are more reactionary and extremist, and al-Qaeda, to take advantage of the Syrian conflict to further destabilise the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is inevitable that Bashar al-Assad will fall. It is just a matter of time. The EU must immediately set out a post-Assad strategy for its action in the aftermath of the fall of the regime, and it must also call on the Syrian opposition to unite, to strive for national conciliation, and to commit to a process of democratic transition, which must include respect for the rights of Syrian minorities, including Alawites and Christians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tanks and fighter jets have been deployed; water, energy, food and medicine supplies have been cut off; a humanitarian crisis is looming. This is a man-made disaster for which Bashar al-Assad is responsible and we must make him stop.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt has mentioned our group priorities and I want to emphasise some additional important and concrete steps that the EU can take to step up its own efforts, irrespective of how China and Russia seek to obstruct any UN measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Let it not be EU Member States who fail to enforce the arms embargo and sanctions. How did a ship with Russian arms leave Cypriot waters to reach Syria? Let it not be European technology companies that export systems used for mass surveillance, censorship tracking and tracing of dissidents. Let it not be the same oil that fuels our cars to drive to the grocery store fuelling the tanks roaming the streets of Homs.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council and Commission guarantee that EU sanctions and embargos are enforced? Aside from a government-led war on Syrian citizens, an information war is raging. Foreign journalists are expelled and brave citizen journalists risk their lives to share videos of their freedom cheers that are met with slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have a way of establishing the precise scope of the man-made disaster in Syria, but 7 000 deaths and tens of thousands being detained in inhumane circumstances, as well as accounts of rape and hunger, tell us enough.</p>

<p class="contents">Besides, if we look honestly at what happened with the Arab Spring in the other countries in the area, I do not think that we would conclude that we managed to do the right thing.

The justification is that a family or a clan wants to consolidate its position and to continue to treat the state as its private property.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to break down the solidarity between existing supporters of the regime and Assad. The followers of the regime in the inner circle must be made aware that they have no future with Assad and they must see to it that the regime implodes. This is always one of the correct approaches in this kind of situation. However, it is also necessary for us to make clear the joint position of the international community and to ensure that a United Nations resolution is put in place. It is not acceptable that Russia has so far refused to do this and, as a result of its own interest in a port, has given priority to its global political position as a player in the Middle East conflict, instead of doing what is needed for the sake of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must establish a special cooperation with the Arab League, which has tabled a resolution for the General Assembly of the United Nations next Thursday. It is important that this receives support from a broad majority of members, so that more pressure can be put on the Security Council, because this is the only body which can draw up a resolution that is binding under international law. I believe that this is extremely important and I think that cooperation with Turkey, as well as with the Arab League, is essential in this respect. This must not be a Western initiative. We need close cooperation under the leadership of the Arab League with the involvement of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have experience of this in Egypt and Libya. Therefore, we must enter into dialogue with the opposition, which needs our support. Ms Gomes has already referred to this when she spoke about minority rights. We must ensure that minority rights and religious freedom are respected. The consequence of the country moving in an Islamist direction must not be the persecution of Christians. In this area, too, we need to enter into a dialogue with the opposition at a very early stage with all the necessary support and we need a commitment that the result will not be a state which introduces injustice on the other side. This is an important issue and will allow us to isolate Assad even further within his own country, as many minorities are still on Assad’s side because they are afraid of what will happen afterwards and because they are hoping for more stability. The religious and ethnic minorities must be given the clear prospect of equal rights and the opportunity to live their own lives. Therefore, we also need to look at the situation from this perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since Russia and China used their veto in the Security Council last week, the brutal violence has intensified even more. The situation appears to be hopeless and is threatening to drag on for a long time yet, with some very dramatic events undoubtedly still to come. The gradual tightening of the sanctions does not seem, for the time being, to have made much of an impression on the al-Assad regime. However, the pressure is increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we can still count on the striking decisiveness shown by the Arab League and also on the outspoken commitment shown by Turkey in this dossier. Secondly, there is no doubt that the economic sanctions are weakening several of the regime’s pillars and thus also increasing the isolation of the regime. We therefore need to keep increasing that pressure, not just on Syria itself, but also on countries like Russia and China which continue to stand in the way of clear international condemnation. What I would advocate is, for example, very clearly drawing up a blacklist, or similar, of companies which continue to traffic weapons to Syria or support the regime in any other way.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the country’s complexity, its location in the region and its large number of minorities, it is imperative that we offer a clear and credible prospect for the future, as well as a blueprint for a new Syria, in which the minorities that are currently still unsure whether or not to abandon their support of the regime will also feel at home. In the short term, it is important that we, as the European Union, attend to the necessary humanitarian tasks: food aid, medicines and the idea of developing an aid corridor, and finally to joining forces with the Arab League and Turkey in order to further increase the pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is our first precondition. Secondly, we must have a strategy that is credible, responsible and humanitarian. The most important issue regarding credibility concerns Chancellor Merkel’s visit to China last week. How can we talk about China and Russia when we ask ourselves what, while there, she said and did to bring China over to our side in the United Nations regarding Syria? She did nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we talk about credibility while European companies are aiding the Syrian regime with Internet censorship tools, and while they continue to receive EU subsidies? Moreover, in Syria, I saw Iraqi and Palestinian refugee camps; traces of our latest mistakes in that region of the world. How can we talk about a humanitarian strategy while we cannot manage to reach a consensus on opening humanitarian corridors in order to remove those refugees from there, along with the more recent Syrian refugees?</p>

Would it be possible for me to be given two minutes? Thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I will give a brief analysis, beginning with the situation inside Syria. The death toll currently stands at around 8 000, and about 1 000 of the dead are children under the age of 15. Around 20 000 people are missing, while 70 000 have been arrested. Syria is suffering from a shortage of water and electricity. No help of any kind is reaching the civilian population, because vehicles carrying humanitarian aid attract rocket fire. The homes of civilians are also being attacked by artillery. It is difficult to get to the wounded, and those who flee are shot at by snipers. As regards the international situation, on the one hand, we have Iranian mercenaries fighting in Syria; on the other, we have Russia, which continues to sell equipment to the Syrian regime, and there is also the stalemate at the UN, where a resolution on the matter has been vetoed.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the remedy to this? The High Representative, Catherine Ashton, has spoken about this, Mr Søvndal has spoken about this, and so have my fellow Members. What should be done? We need to help the opposition, increase sanctions against the Syrian regime, negotiate with Russia and China and possibly think about the International Criminal Court in The Hague for the President. These are, of course, the right measures, but they need time. However, we must do something immediately to put an end to the killing of civilians. I think we should force President Assad to make it possible for a humanitarian corridor to be opened and to allow civilians to leave besieged towns and stadiums. This doubtless will not protect all of them from losing their lives, but it certainly will reduce the losses caused by the fighting and, on the other hand, it will allow us to provide whatever humanitarian assistance might be needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, it is important that the EU be able to speak with one voice on the meaning of the values of respect for human life in the face of an indiscriminate and disgracefully orchestrated massacre. The whole international community must keep up the pressure on the Syrian regime by applying new restrictive measures. The murders need to stop, and this is non-negotiable. It is indisputably vital to insist on dialogue: a democratic Syria needs a period of transition and guarantees for all its minorities. However, it will not be possible to apply more restrictive measures to the Syrian regime if all countries are not pulling in the same direction. Unfortunately, it is clear that this has not happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the thousands of dead, what has changed between the two resolutions disgracefully rejected in the UN Security Council? We will continue to criticise the position of China and Russia, which are becoming increasingly isolated, owing to their unbelievable support for the Syrian regime. Everything else is the same: a rotten, desperate and cornered regime is continuing to govern a country and we, the international community, remain helpless to stop the genocide of a people.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already behind in toughening up action by the EU and the international community. We need to give more concrete support to the Arab League in its interventions and attempts to send a peacekeeping force to Syria. We need to give our unreserved support to the work of the Red Crescent in its efforts to mitigate the suffering of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Criminal Court must begin taking steps immediately to punish those responsible for the crimes against humanity that are being committed. In addition, as a form of pressure on countries that continue to support Bashar al-Assad, all EU trade with Russian or Chinese companies that have trade relations with Syria should be banned. This should already have begun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They stood here outside the parliament building and some of them came in and spoke to us. Thus, we have known for a long time what is going on and we know that what Syria’s leader is doing is a crime against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can the EU do? One thing is clear: even though it is extremely important, humanitarian aid alone is not enough. We also know, in my opinion, that military action is not an option. The veto in the UN makes it particularly important for the EU, together with others, to form a broad political front using all the means that we have at our disposal in a world where dependence on the international community is so strong, even for a country like Syria. The images and the information are there as a public resource all over the world, not just for those within Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">We must show solidarity; we must put a great deal of pressure on Russia and China; we must cooperate with the Arab League and others; we must investigate all possibilities and we must keep arms trading under control.

Of course, we do probably all realise we are not in a position somehow to use this debate to bring about a diametric change in the situation, but I do think it is right that these words have been said. It is also right that appeals be made from the floor, here, although I do not think they should now be made to President Assad. I agree with Mr Kamiński, who said he thinks there is now no point in dialogue with President Assad. However, an appeal should be made from here, today, to his ministers, generals and officers, to soldiers and police officers, to those who, on the grounds of President Assad’s felonious orders, are murdering their own citizens. We need to appeal to these people and tell them openly: if you do not stop what you are doing, if you do not stop murdering your own citizens, you will one day find yourselves standing before the International Criminal Court in The Hague, because we will not forget this, and records will be kept of what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should certainly appeal to Russia and China and say – at one time this was a popular saying in Poland – ‘do not go that way’, because it is the way of compromise and shame. It is a shameful route, it is a route which cannot be accepted in the 21st century, particularly in Europe, so this appeal should be directed particularly to the authorities in Russia. However, I think an appeal should also be made to the High Commissioner and the European Commission to intensify aid to what may be a weak and scattered Syrian opposition, but which is an opposition nonetheless. Perhaps we should be helping them; perhaps we should organise a meeting of these dispersed opposition groups so that they are conscious of our support. In our role as MEPs, it may be that we cannot do much, but perhaps we should consider – here I appeal to my fellow Members in the Chamber – if we should set up a European Parliament Syria Intergroup to express our support for those who are protesting against Assad’s criminal regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bombarding your own people with heavy artillery, imprisoning and torturing civilians, including children: these are things that we cannot tolerate and which bear witness to the blindness of a criminal regime.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to become indignant and to condemn; it is harder to act, and to act effectively. Once we exclude – properly I believe – the possibility of military intervention as in Libya, we should recognise that our scope for action is very limited. There are, however, ways to contribute to the further isolation of this regime, an isolation that is, as Mr Brok emphasised, without doubt, the most realistic way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, sanctions, on which the EU has taken the lead. These must be reinforced as much as possible, and they are a useful course of action. In the key area of diplomacy, we must first condemn the unchallengeable Russian and Chinese vetoes and we must, above all, make these countries realise that such vetoes are not only unacceptable, they are also incomprehensible and are a dead end for those countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arab League is taking initiatives; it is playing a major role which is to be welcomed and which ought to be supported and strengthened, even if all of the options that it presents are unrealisable in the short term. These initiatives have the immense merit of being in existence and of being widely adopted by responsible countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the political need to apply maximum pressure on the Syrian regime and those who support it, like Iran and Russia, there is also a humanitarian emergency. The demand for unconditional, immediate access to the victims has no need of a UN resolution; it is an absolute moral duty. The EU and its Member States must bring all of their weight to bear to push forward the Arab League‘s initiatives and bring an end to the scandal of this repression from another age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must apply tougher sanctions and they must remain in place, even if this regime believes that it can stay in power. They must only be lifted when the regime is removed or steps down.

Everyone with responsibility for foreign policy in the EU and its Member States must take every opportunity to call on Russia and China to lift their veto on a substantial resolution in the UN Security Council. We expect better than this from Russia. It is ultimately a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the values and principles of these institutions also apply to foreign policy. They cannot simply be ignored outside Europe. It is obscene that Russia is still supplying this regime with arms. We must call on Mr Putin and Mr Medvedev to stop this or they will join the long list of abominable figures in Russian history.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to see the EU taking joint action to withdraw its ambassadors from Damascus. Why can we not even manage to do something like this? Which petty national vanities are being acted out here to prevent us from doing this?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to coordinate closely with Turkey. Wherever possible, we need to take joint public action, for example, in establishing refugee camps on the Turkish side of the border as a preventive measure. We must enhance the political status of the Syrian opposition by holding high-level talks and adopting joint declarations of intent for the post-Assad period.</p>
<p class="contents">These declarations should make it clear that there must be a future for all Syrians, including ethnic and religious minorities, and that the European Union will provide comprehensive support for this kind of Syria as it moves towards a new future. We must also prepare ourselves for changes in the neighbouring countries if the regime is toppled. We must expect the situation in Lebanon to deteriorate, for example, and therefore we should already be telling all the parties there not to believe that they can exploit a short-term vacuum in Syria by using violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That requires a number of things. First, clear support for the plan drawn up by the Arab League countries. Second, close cooperation with Turkey. It is a key player in the region. Third, cooperation with Russia, not only at the UN, but also at the bilateral level between the EU and Russia. Fourth, cooperation with opposition forces, including with regard to the post-Assad democratisation plan for Syria. And fifth, and I consider this to be the most important, cooperation with the forces of the ruling Ba’ath Party that are willing to support Syria’s transition to a democratic regime. This is the key lesson from post-Saddam Iraq. Cooperation with them would also prevent the Islamists from seizing power in Syria.

We have talked about this numerous times at sittings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Human Rights. We are unanimous in condemning what is currently going on in Syria, because sending tanks and aircraft against your own people and shooting at them is horrifying and can only be condemned, but, at the same time, it should be said that this is typical of despotic governments such as the Syrian regime. The veto exercised by Russia and China against the UN Security Council resolution has intensified the tragic nature of the situation. We must indeed put pressure here on these two countries to change their position and, above all, to stop exporting arms to Syria, because these weapons are, of course, being used against the protesters.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also support the proposal, put forward by the League of Arab States, to send peacekeeping forces under a mandate from the United Nations. The stance of the Arab League in supporting the Syrian opposition is an important step towards building a group of friends around Syria so that an end can be brought to the massacre of human lives. The numbers have already been talked about here. We must also put pressure on the regime to allow peaceful and democratic change in Syria. I think that among those who – as Mr Lisek said – are part of the Ba’ath Party there are also those who can see that a crime is being committed against their own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The tanks and soldiers should be taken off the streets, and a fundamental objective for all action should also be the release of persecuted oppositionists and demonstrators. Syrian society needs humanitarian aid, too. I think providing that aid at this juncture requires chiefly the opening of a humanitarian corridor, which the Arab League is talking about and which is possible in the direction of the border with Turkey. We are agreed that the humanitarian corridor should be used to rescue the people who are caught up in this tragic situation and to help those who need help – the wounded as well as other people in Syria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the UN, over 5 000 Syrians have been killed in President Assad’s bloody attempts to suppress a popular revolution. The western world, together with the Arab League, condemns the actions of the current Syrian Government and urges President Assad to listen to the Syrian people, give up his political power and facilitate free elections, as he promised in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">However, such appeals were rejected by Russia and China, most recently in the UN Security Council vote on a Syria resolution that included sanctions against President Assad’s regime. I stress the need for further diplomatic action in order to change Russia’s opinion and support the Syrian public fighting for change. Baroness Ashton has already spoken in strong terms before this Parliament about the need for Russia to change its attitude towards its ally in the Middle East in the light of Syria’s bloody actions against its own citizens. I continue to support the Baroness in her efforts to influence the Russian Ambassador to the UN and make him realise that he is supporting a regime that commits acts bordering on genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events in Syria are intolerable, and we must continue to exert political pressure on the Syrian Government, as well as on Russia and China, to change their opinions and to protect the people of Syria from their own government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I greatly appreciate the presence of the representative of the Danish Presidency, and I welcome what he has said today, but a debate on a question so important as this southern neighbour of the European Union, a country with which we have very close relations, must not be held without a representative of European diplomacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise two matters. The first is the Russian and Chinese veto. In the Security Council, these countries took upon themselves the responsibility for aggravating the conflict in Syria and, in fact, for the hundreds of human lives which were lost following the intensified attacks made by government forces on the civilian population, something which took place right after the Chinese and Russian veto. The situation here is as follows. Russia says the veto is related to the fact that it does not want a resolution which would be able to bring about the removal of a regime that it considers to be legitimate. Well, we think a regime which kills its own citizens – over 6 000 people – is not legitimate. In doing this, it undermines its legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I expect EU diplomacy to be as closely involved as possible in establishing a humanitarian corridor, in order to help those who are most at risk from government attacks, those who are wounded, and those who do not have access to hospital care. This is the most important thing today, and it is a test for European diplomacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is caused by a feeling of impotence in the face of the suffering and the deaths of thousands of ordinary Syrians. Can more, therefore, be done than has been done, could more have been done than impose diplomatic sanctions, partial, limited economic sanctions and an embargo on the supply of military equipment to Syria?</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly speaking, probably not much, but there are examples – from the very recent history of last year – which show that if the international community works together and in unison, then the action it takes, not just diplomatic action, but limited military action, does bring positive results. In view of this, can it be said that debates like today’s and the successive resolutions we adopt – this is now the fourth on Syria – are worth the effort? Yes, they are. Firstly, because they allow us to reiterate our solidarity with the abused and repressed people of Syria. Secondly, they mean we make the Syrian authorities aware that we are watching what is happening – we are closely watching the development of the situation in Syria, and those who commit criminal acts will not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, however, they enable us finally to persuade European governments, European leaders and the European Foreign Affairs Council – and we appeal for this, too, in the resolution – firstly, to extend significantly the package of sanctions which have been imposed on Syria – diplomatic and economic sanctions; secondly, to increase the scale of humanitarian aid being provided to the needy and suffering; thirdly, to show determination in bilateral relations with Russia and with China and to persuade these countries to adopt a UN resolution which will make it possible to take effective action in defence of innocent people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly disturbing is the information about the Syrian military and the way it is imprisoning, detaining and torturing children. This is a case of truly exceptional cruelty. The Member States should unite and start taking action, even without UN support. If we wait until Russia and China come over to our side, then it may be too late.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that a special summit is to be held, like the one on Libya, but this is not now only about ending the conflict, but also about our maintaining a European presence in the region. Europe is often accused of a lack of political involvement and that it acts too late, including, in particular, in the Middle East. So this time let us make sure we stay ahead of the development of events. At the summit, the Member States must also think about how to work with Syria after the fall of the regime. Now – right away – we must plan measures which will guarantee stability in Syria, and plan these measures in conjunction with the League of Arab States. How can intercultural conflicts be prevented? We do not want another war, here, and we do not want a repeat of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Until then, we can only count on the righteous in Syria – people who are risking their own lives to rescue other Syrians, protecting and saving them from the hands of a cruel regime. I am currently working on a written declaration which will honour the righteous and establish a European Day of Remembrance for the Righteous. I hope that when this nightmare in Syria ends, we will also honour the deeds of the upright and the righteous in Syria and, at the moment, there are many of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard a great deal this afternoon on this topic. The question in my mind is: why are Syria’s rulers so obstinate in resisting change of any kind? The Assad regime has not offered a single meaningful concession to the social forces demanding change. I think this requires an explanation that few of the assessments have so far offered.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a mistake to see Syria as a unified society, far from it: it is wholly divided, with basically five major groups living side by side. The group that has monopolised power is the Alawites, to which Assad’s own extended family belongs. The Alawites have co-opted the Druze, the Christians and the Shia. Taken together, they make up about 30% of the population. The majority of those at the heart of the anti-Assad movement are Sunni Muslims, who have been very largely excluded from power and its benefits by the Assad system. The fear of the ruling establishment is that a simple majority system would put power in the hands of the Sunni majority, with no guarantees that other groups would be included in a future regime run by the Sunnis.</p>
<p class="contents">Any settlement, if it is to work, must take these factors into account. Otherwise, sadly, the fighting and killing will go on, because neither side will see any benefit from a settlement. International guarantees for the security and well-being of Syria’s minorities are essential if a settlement is to last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of its supporters are concerned by the legitimacy of regime change through foreign intervention, while in Russia’s case, there are also crucial strategic motivations. If the current Syrian regime falls, Russia will not only lose a strategic partner which allows it to continue to be part of the Middle East equation, but also a naval bridgehead in the region and an important customer for its arms exports, possibly even a component in its complex relations with Iran.</p>

It is deeply regrettable that the minimum action required at this stage, the UN resolution, was vetoed by China and Russia. It is vital that pressure be brought to bear on Russia, in particular, to recognise their responsibility in this region. Their actions have given the lead to President al-Assad in claiming that he has international backing for his actions. That is a heavy responsibility in light of the continued bloodshed on the streets of Syria and the purge of the city of Homs.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Members have sincerely called for a new Syria. There is much to fear as to what will come next. For Syria’s 2.5 million Christians, they look at what has happened in Egypt and Iraq and see that freedom of religion is not part of the new dawn. Instead, they are experiencing increased persecution. We want to see Syria free from the tyranny of al-Assad but we want to ensure that the new Syria is one where everyone can live peaceably, including the Christian minority.

Syrian Sunnis have fought in the Iraq war in the past and now their fellow Sunnis are returning the favour. These people are linked together not just by tribal relationships that go back centuries, but also by a common religion. Importantly, the Sunni Arabs on the western border of Iraq are attempting to strengthen their own position in relation to the Shi’ite central government in Baghdad.</p>
<p class="contents">As if this and the involvement of Iran were not enough in the way of conflicts, it is looking increasingly likely that al-Qaeda is intending to move into Syria. In the light of the Russian veto, a UN peacekeeping mission has no real chance of success, in my opinion, quite apart from the fact that a mission of this kind would only make sense in the event of a ceasefire. The EU should not allow itself to be drawn even further into this confusion of conflicts, because in a religious war, it could really get its fingers burnt and the result would be spectacular failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is easy to understand why, as the situation is appalling. I believe that everyone in this Chamber shares the view that it is unbearable to watch people being fired at by mortar bombs in residential areas, people who go out and demonstrate peacefully being shot at, and people being tortured, disappearing or having to flee. I believe that everyone shares the same contempt for a regime that responds in such a way to its own people. That is also one of the reasons why we in the European Council have utilised almost every foreign minister meeting that I can remember to discuss Syria as one of the major topics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to emphasise that we have a strategy in the EU. We have a strategy that we are following and that we will continue to follow concerning the best way for Europe to help the Syrian people in the current situation. Our first message is: stop the violence. Stop shooting at your own people. This is the position that we are putting forward in all international fora in which we have the opportunity to do so. We are doing this in the United Nations General Assembly, where a vote will take place tomorrow on a resolution which will supposedly strongly condemn what is happening in Syria. We will also do this in relation to the UN Security Council, because, as many speakers have also mentioned, it is crucial to get the UN Security Council to criticise the position of Russia and China on this matter at every opportunity we get. As a responsible member of the Security Council, as one of the permanent representatives, we cannot just sit back and watch what is happening. We have a responsibility to protect, as some speakers have also said. That is something that we intend to pin both China and Russia down on. I also believe that it will make an impression not only if the EU says this here, but also if the Arab League and Turkey do so, too. I noticed today that China is on a tour around the Arab countries. They are presumably doing this because they believe that they have something to explain.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also use our opportunity at the meeting in Tunisia on 24 February to put our message across in respect of putting a stop to the violence and finding a political solution. After all, there is only a political solution to the crisis that we are facing. We will ultimately promote our position everywhere else, in all other fora in which we have the opportunity to do so. After all, that is what we as foreign ministers do – that is what Baroness Ashton, the High Representative, spends her time doing.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the options for action? Again, I understand your impatience very well. There are four possible areas for action that we will continue to pursue. The first is the consideration of a peacekeeping force, which will come from the Arab countries and which they wish to implement in collaboration with the UN. The specific form that this is to take is still somewhat unclear, but it is one of the topics we will pursue further when we meet in Tunisia. Next there is a proposal for international corridors. In this regard, I will simply say that we will certainly not rule this out, but it requires very strong backing from the international community, because where international corridors are concerned, we are talking about forcing our way forward. In this case, we are talking about military operations. There have also been some strong words said about avoiding a devastating civil war. I do not necessarily think it is wise to take more weapons into an area where there is a risk of civil war, with the risk of the situation getting out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the debate today has confirmed much of what constitutes the EU’s position in this conflict. Firstly, we are continuing to tighten the sanctions. That is something that we will also do at the next meeting on 27 February. We are increasing the number of areas and the number of people covered by the sanctions. We are increasing humanitarian aid where we can and, in this regard, we are not ruling anything out. We are working ever more closely with the opposition and we are also calling on the members of the opposition to work closely together themselves so that we do not have an opposition that is fighting amongst themselves. That is absolutely crucial if a new Syria is to emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make a comment regarding yet another debate, namely, the question of what alternative there is to President Assad. Someone said that it is ethnic extremism. I do not believe that. I believe that the Syrians have the same desire as everyone else, namely, to determine their own future in an arrangement in which we give them the opportunity to do so and we press for this to happen. I do not believe that any country is condemned to choose between a dictatorship or religious extremism. I think this is also the lesson we can learn from some of the elections we have seen in North Africa, for example, in Tunisia, where we are due to meet on 24 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the debate. I will take the conclusions and the contributions that have been made to the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and they will, of course, be used to help shape the opinions that will be the EU’s opinions on the conflict and our contribution to finding a solution to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Taking advantage of legitimate concerns about the situations in various countries of the region, a massive campaign of deception and lies is under way in the mainstream media and is attempting to obscure the real reasons for the violence that has been reported in Syria for several months: intervention and infiltration by foreign special forces and secret services, involving funding, training and weaponry for armed mercenaries and terrorist groups, are being presented as a popular struggle for democracy. At a time when the development of the international situation, marked by the deepening crisis of capitalism in multiple areas, is pointing to the real and significant dangers of further wars of aggression against the peoples of the region, which jeopardise international security, it is more important than ever to assert the values of peace and international solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These were the words spoken by our Minister, Mr Alain Juppé, to the European Parliament, on Wednesday 15 February. Words of great common sense and hope: France, Europe and the world support, and will continue to support, the Syrian people. They will certainly support them, but it is more important to save them. Over the last 10 days, nearly 300 people have been killed in Homs by government forces, taking to almost 6 000 the number of deaths since the beginning of the uprising. On Sunday, the Arab League, faced with the extreme urgency of the situation, proposed a new plan: to send in UN peacekeepers. Some Member States find the idea of Western intervention dangerous; others see in it a first step towards stopping the violence. If the European Union wants to exert pressure and act, it must speak with one voice: that is the aim of the Foreign Affairs Council on 27 February. In the meantime, the Friends of Syria Group (an initiative by President Sarkozy) will meet on Friday 24th in Tunis; this will send a strong signal to Damascus, and also to Moscow and Beijing, which continue to block the United Nations Security Council sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
