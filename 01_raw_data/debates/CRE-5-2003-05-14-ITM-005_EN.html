<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the prospect of completing the enlargement procedure with the ten new Member States gave rise last year to a new initiative regarding the European Union's relations with its new geographical and political environment, its new neighbours. Essentially, over and above naming issues, what we see here is a new debate on how the European Union should see the future of its relations with a series of countries which encircle it.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate, which has been given the name 'Wider Europe – New neighbours', was basically inaugurated last year with interventions and contributions from the Member States. I refer to the letter from Jack Straw, Mrs Lindh and Mr Pagrotsky, the Minister for Trade, followed by a joint letter from Mr Solana and Mr Patten. The Council discussed and adopted conclusions on the new neighbours initiative on 19 December 2002 for the Ukraine, Moldavia and Belarus, asked for specific proposals to be formulated for the endeavour and widened its limits to other neighbouring areas. Thus, the Council stated its intention to create an ambitious, long-term and integrated approach for each of these three neighbouring countries. This approach is based on the principle of differentiation, taking account of the conditions which characterise each country, its political and economic power, its performance and the Union's objectives for each.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, approximately one year after it started, completion of the enlargement procedure has strengthened our prospect of such an approach, in that it tables the wider fabric of relations between the Union and its neighbours, thereby managing to spread basic principles such as peace, security and prosperity, which are hugely important to the citizens of Europe. The objective of combining this sort of policy with continuing and deepening enlargement is to create a ring of friends around the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen Council talked about common political and economic values, it talked about preventing the creation of new dividing lines and about promoting peace and stability inside and outside the Union's borders. These thoughts were debated in depth in April, when the strengthening of cooperation between the European Union and its eastern and Mediterranean neighbours and how to evaluate their progress was examined. The same issue was examined at the European Conference held at head of state and government level in Athens on 17 April and it will be discussed at the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference on 26 and 27 May 2003. In particular, the European Conference on 17 April provided an opportunity to start the dialogue on the general principles of the overall initiative and to issue a statement specifying its common objectives, objectives which are accepted by the new Member States, which are accepted by the associated countries, the EFTA countries, the countries of the western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldavia and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the New Neighbours initiative is an attempt by us to give new momentum to a framework which already exists and concerns relations with our neighbouring countries to the south and east. It does not, of course, concern candidate countries or potential candidate countries, the countries of the western Balkans. Its scope may be reviewed in the future, depending on developments. The situation is also being monitored in other areas which are not very far away, in the southern Caucasus, which also does not at present come under the initiative, and I should like to point out that Russia is a special case and that needs to be reflected in its relationship with this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of differentiation to which I referred concerns the means, the preconditions and the time frame which will be set to achieve our objectives, which are to promote the new political and economic values, prosperity and peace. As regards the political values, these constitute the basis for improving political relations and are a necessary component for internal political stability and economic prosperity. Promoting the political values will also contribute to the creation and operation of a responsible and efficient administration. The Union can learn important lessons from its enlargement process and can also extend programmes on which it has acquired experience to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Mediterranean countries in particular, we also have a variety of religions and cultures and this can constitute a source of creativity rather than an obstacle to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. On the contrary, we need to find ways to bridge the communication gap which different languages, religions, customs and behaviours create, so that we respect cultural diversity at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to common economic values. Here too, the ultimate objective for neighbours not contemplating accession is participation in the European area in which common movement of goods, services and capital will apply, the European Economic Area. This is a prospect which can also constitute a medium-term alternative in other cases. The integration of Russia and the Ukraine in the global economic system is of particular importance. In addition, the procedure which we have already started up with Russia to create a common European Economic Area can also be examined for the other three eastern neighbours, including of course Belarus once conditions allow.</p>
<p class="contents">Membership of the World Trade Organisation will remain the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to the conclusion of a free trade agreement with Russia and the Ukraine. Preparations for concluding this sort of agreement with Moldavia, which has already joined the World Trade Organisation, will continue. Nor should the prospect of establishing a regime for the free movement of people be completely excluded today, even as a long-term objective. Provided that it is linked to strict conditionality, it could give us a powerful weapon in our effort to persuade our neighbours to the east to proceed with the necessary reforms. It would also demonstrate that the European Union is resolved to prevent the creation of dividing lines on account of enlargement and, in all events, it would give us flexibility in our handling.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Mediterranean partners are concerned, the legal structure of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation has essentially been completed and most of these partners have been integrated into the procedure for the gradual establishment of a free trade zone with the European Union. The liberalisation of trade will also prove to be a catalyst to economic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is to safeguard peace and prosperity inside and outside the Union. Within this framework, it is advisable for us to examine the possibilities for closer cooperation on important international issues, such as terrorism, organised crime, the Petersberg tasks, environmental protection, development aid and immigration. Enlargement is creating new opportunities, but also new challenges, especially as regards our neighbours to the east. The Petersberg tasks and reinforced cooperation with Russia and the Ukraine are an important tool in the direction we want. Reinforced cooperation on combating dangers such as the threat of environmental and nuclear disaster also has major possibilities. On our new eastern borders in particular, combating these threats must be fundamental and must have the position it deserves in our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, we must reinforce political dialogue with a sense of security and create an area of peace and stability. It is advisable to strengthen this dialogue both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the Barcelona process. On the political side of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, measures need to be taken that will improve mutual understanding between the partners, lead to the prevention of misunderstandings and, ultimately, create the preconditions for promoting cooperation in the security sector as well. Following an initiative by the European Parliament, we are promoting the development of the parliamentary dimension of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation by creating the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of creating an area of common prosperity through sustainable and balanced economic and social development is linked to five more specific elements. First element: the establishment of a free trade zone and environmental protection are complementary, not incompatible. We consider that it is advisable for the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean environmental integration strategy adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Environment Ministers in Athens to guide our development actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Second element: the strengthening of the rule of law. The objective of the current framework adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean conference in Valencia is to implement a regional cooperation programme in the field of justice, combating narcotics, organised crime and terrorism and cooperation in dealing with issues to do with the integration of immigrants, immigration itself and the movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Third element: the development of cross-border cooperation and the integration of our neighbouring countries into the trans-European networks, especially the transport, telecommunications and energy networks. On our eastern borders especially, it has proven difficult to coordinate the elements of cross-border cooperation with the tools we already have, Phare, Tacis, Interreg, and the possibility of creating a single special tool which will have all the elements of cross-border cooperation of the existing programmes is under serious examination and we await the relevant proposals of the European Commission with interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth element: close cooperation in the energy sector. Many of our neighbours are important suppliers and our policy will focus on the energy security of the Union, again in keeping with the principle of differentiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth element: adequate criteria for progress with reforms. The Union's position as regards what these countries should expect once they meet the criteria set must be clear cut. The ultimate objective must be attractive, such as the conclusion of an enhanced agreement. We must examine the issue of the name especially carefully. Often, symbolism can prove to be a useful tool and incentive for essential reforms. And here the principle of differentiation must be carefully applied.</p>

The Member States have begun dealing with this subject in the Council, and Mr Yiannitsis has just reported on that in some detail. We have discussed this subject with the future Member States, and there has been the very laudable initiative of the Greek Presidency, in connection with the signing of the enlargement treaty in Athens, to discuss this subject with those partner states that will be affected by this New Neighbours Initiative in the course of a European Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to tell you that responses to this were thoroughly positive, so we can assume that this initiative can rely on a sufficient level of political support across the board. The starting point for our proposals on a new neighbourhood policy is of course enlargement, but now is not the time to discuss the membership prospects of our new neighbours. What we need for the coming decade is above all a differentiated strategy for intensive good-neighbourly relations that is not linked with any statement about the question of accession. It is our intention to export the stability, security and prosperity that we have created and hope to build upon in the enlarged European Union. President Prodi has already described this objective as a ‘ring of friends’ surrounding us, a ring extending from Russia to Morocco. This will allow us to share with our partners much of what makes the European Union what it is, not least the common market and its rules, our Community programmes and political dialogue, but not our internal institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already explained that the countries of the western Balkans and also Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are not included in this ring, and why that is. These countries already have prospects for future membership, and in the case of Romania and Bulgaria this already involves a specific time frame.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the intensity and pace at which relations between the EU and individual countries develop will depend on the capabilities and ambitions of the individual partner states. But in this case too, as for enlargement, the principle of differentiation will play an important part. We therefore want to work out an action plan with each individual country based on experience and our present treaty commitments. These action plans will set out our common road map, and will contain objectives, timetables, modalities and monitoring mechanisms binding both sides in the same way. It will emerge from this process whether or not we need new treaty instruments. However, it is in any case intended that work should proceed under the existing partnership and cooperation agreements, and should not be delayed by the prospect of further agreements in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Where do we stand at present with this project? Well, for the time being, in conjunction with the candidate countries and the partner states, we are making our contribution to the discussions and conclusions planned in the Council. We have held our first exploratory talks with Ukraine and Moldova, so as to pave the way for the necessary cooperation. For the EU-Ukraine Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, both sides have jointly produced a detailed analysis of what has been achieved and have jointly determined what further steps are required. Internally, within the Commission that is, we are now in the process of working out the basic planks of the action plans. Each national plan must relate to a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas. It must be possible to measure how this has been implemented in practice against predetermined criteria, so that the progress reports envisaged can be drawn up. So you will see that we want to make use of an instrument that has already very much proved its worth during the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">We are developing the basis of a new financial instrument and although we have already outlined the general purposes of this instrument, we still need to define it more precisely and to establish the planning principles and the overall financial envelope. We intend to bring forward a special communication on this subject in the autumn. We should then be in a position to start on the practical work, as soon as we have been given the necessary political green light. As you have heard, the Presidency is working on that and the Presidency's approach has the Commission's full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's contribution to the further debate will not only be significant but will also carry weight. The representatives of the people in our partner states must play their part in contributing to further progress. We can take it that the parliaments of the partner states will attach great importance to the views of the European Parliament, and I would also be grateful if the Members of the European Parliament would use their contacts to enter into an intensive dialogue and exchange of experience with parliamentarians in the partner states.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am very pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already appointed a rapporteur and had its first discussion on this. I wish Mrs Napoletano every success with her task, and I would like to assure her that she can totally rely on the full support and cooperation of the Commission in her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
