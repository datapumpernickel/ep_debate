<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am quite happy to clearly explain the Presidency’s position on relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation, especially as, in a few days, on 28 October, I shall, in fact, be in Moscow, together with the European troika, to examine with Mr Ivanov the prospects for the European Union-Russian Federation Summit planned for Rome on 6 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like to say that the Presidency believes that EU-Russian relations should have strategic importance and that it is therefore in the European Union’s interest to develop these relations into a close partnership: there is now a basis for it in the partnership and cooperation agreement, which was the subject of one of the first joint strategies drawn up by the European Union, and was brought up to date with the St Petersburg Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is in our interest to encourage the reform process begun by the Russian Federation and its move towards closer relations with the European Union. This process seems contradictory at times. There are probably forces still operating within the Russian Federation which, perhaps furtively – so to speak – oppose this progressive integration of the Federation into European structures; but on the other hand such integration is an objective that President Putin strongly shares. This is why we must encourage those who wish to support and promote a closer and more positive relationship with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The St Petersburg Declaration was an important turning-point in our relations with Moscow and marked out a path that the Presidency, with the agreement of the Commission and the support of the Member States, intends to follow: we must give substance to this privileged strategic partner relationship that we intend to have with the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">The St Petersburg Declaration marked out the path to create four common spaces. This approach, which we support, forms a basis for the work to be done at the forthcoming summit on 6 November. As regards the common economic space, first and foremost, we are waiting for the high-level working group to conclude its work. Commissioner Verheugen will be having a final meeting with his Russian counterpart, the deputy Prime Minister Mr Khristenko, on 28 October. We should then reach a final agreement on the actual concept of a common economic space and on operational matters arising from it. We hope – and we are working towards this – that we can agree on a common commitment to pursue an even higher level of integration of our economies, through greater liberalisation of trade and greater convergence in terms of regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the European Union is involved in the negotiations for Russia to join the World Trade Organization. Talks are at a very advanced stage, although there are still a few problems to resolve: I refer, in particular, to energy prices and access to the services market. Commissioner Lamy recently spoke to the Council on this matter and was given strong encouragement to continue with the negotiations. We are aware that Russia’s membership of the World Trade Organization is an important, essential condition for a genuine common economic space.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the common external security space, we are preparing a draft joint statement setting the criteria, principles and objectives of collaboration in the field of crisis management, which should cover the use of both military resources and civilian resources. We hope that through this joint declaration we can spotlight our cooperation in this area of special importance for the Union’s external actions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the common internal security space front, we can report good collaboration, in particular in the fight against organised crime. We are on the finishing straight as regards signing the agreement between Europol and the Russian Interior Minister, and we hope to be able to report the event during the 6 November summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of internal security, Russia had asked us to examine a new visa waiver scheme for short visits. We are aware that this is a request that can be set in the medium to long term, but a number of preconditions will need to be met first on the Russian side. Talks with the Russian authorities on this subject have already started and this is encouraging in any case; a working group has already met, on 13 October, to deal with this matter. We attach importance to concluding the negotiations on visas and also those on the readmission agreement: this is a particularly important area, I would say one of the conditions for examining, overall, the Russian request to abolish short-stay visas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we hope to be able to report some progress even, as one might say, ‘under current regulations’, without changing the rules. Some Member States, including Italy, have already established bilateral agreements, and others have stated their intention to do so. The Presidency intends, of course, to work towards a common position that can so far as possible absorb the bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the common space of culture and education: here we have to work much harder, because very little has been achieved so far. Among the positive points I can, however, mention the fact that the Russian Federation has recently joined the so-called ‘Bologna process’, a collaboration mechanism that promotes agreement on academic titles and the harmonisation of university curricula. It is an important development. I must also mention the possibility of renewing the cooperation agreement in the field of science and technology, and also the prospect of including the Russian Federation in certain Community programmes in the culture and education sector, something that the Italian Presidency is encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the St Petersburg conclusions, there is one aspect on which there is still a difference of opinion: the way the Permanent Partnership Council operates. On the Russian side, they continue to interpret the St Petersburg Declaration as meaning that the council should meet not only in different guises depending on the various subjects dealt with, but also in the 25 + 1 format. On the European side, the belief is instead that the council should operate mainly according to the troika formula, even if the troika is opened up to other members who may be interested. I hope to deal with this matter in greater depth during my visit to Moscow on 28 October.</p>
<p class="contents">In our talks with Moscow, we shall continue to stand by our positions of principle and our concerns regarding the protraction of the Chechnya crisis and respect for human rights. The match that is being played out in Chechnya has a significance that extends well beyond that territory: its outcome, whether positive or negative, will be felt throughout the Caucasus and will thus affect the overall security of the continent. We have shown the European Union’s support for the broad constitutional reform initiative that President Putin has launched through the adoption of a new Constitution, approved by a vast majority in a popular referendum. We have also supported the passing of an amnesty law, which will be important in furthering the reconciliation process. In the presidential consultations of 5 October 2003, we saw yet another step in the gradual resumption of normal political and administrative life in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we reiterate our support for President Putin’s institutional approach and for a political solution that involves those increasingly broad sections of the Chechen population that have no links with terrorism and are therefore entitled to take part in the process of democratic reconstruction. In parallel with constitutional reform, in fact, we believe that there is room to improve the current standards of human rights in the region and the relations between the Chechen population and their administrators. We shall also reiterate our interest and encouragement for the Russian authorities to achieve the swift and safe release of the <span class="italic">Médecins Sans Frontières</span> representative, Arjan Erkel, who was kidnapped in the Caucasus in August 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, during the Summit, we intend to underline the urgency for everyone involved, including the European Union and Russia, to redouble their efforts to achieve a solution to the current conflicts in the ex-Soviet sphere: I refer to Transdniestria and the southern Caucasus, in particular Nagorno Karabakh and South Ossetia. With the enlargement of the Union and the increasing proximity of our borders, the Union has become rather more sensitive to this than previously, as it directly affects the security of the continent. At the same time, we recognise the great responsibility that Moscow has to face and the great contribution it can make in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall spare no effort or encouragement in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am extremely grateful for the Minister's comprehensive and very clear explanation on the prospects for the summit with the Russian Federation. It is of course long-standing good practice for Parliament to review our relations with Russia on the occasion of forthcoming summits. Parliament may recall that it was briefed at the May part-session before the St Petersburg Summit by my colleague and friend, Commissioner Verheugen, and we are now in the phase of implementing its conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have five major expectations from the Rome Summit, which were alluded to by the presidency. First of all, we want to find a common understanding with Russia on the approach to creating the common spaces, stressing the strategic nature of relations between Europe and Russia. We should agree on how to do this, for example, by drawing up a joint document, which should contain specific, achievable objectives for the medium term, building on the partnership and cooperation agreement and taking into account the Wider Europe initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to intensify discussions on the impact of enlargement. It is in Russia’s interest that the partnership and cooperation agreement should be extended smoothly to the acceding Member States, without any discrimination. This is a formality, and one on which we want to tie up loose ends by 1 May 2004. If we cannot achieve this, we will need to agree to apply the partnership and cooperation agreement on a provisional basis, as in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we will take note of reports on the common European economic area and the energy dialogue, to both of which the presidency referred in some detail. I spent 18 months myself working with deputy Prime Minister Khristenko on the European economic area. We were at what one could call the conceptual stage. I hope that will bear fruit by the time of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I hope we can reach agreement with Russia on ways to address common challenges. This means tackling problems primarily in the fields of Justice and Home Affairs, and the environment. We will, for example, request Russia once again to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible, and ask Russia to intensify cooperation on nuclear and maritime safety, on terrorism and on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we are ready to agree a joint declaration on cooperation on political and security matters, including crisis management. In particular, the European Union expects positive signals from Russia on its readiness to cooperate on the Transdniestrian region of Moldova. We are also ready to look at ways to step up cooperation on civil protection, in order to make best use of existing structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving these results – and perhaps I uncharacteristically understate the point – is not without obstacles. The presidency has referred to two examples. One in relation to the Permanent Partnership Council and the other in relation to visa requirements and the negotiation of a readmission agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In making all these points, the European Union will recall the importance of the common values which underpin European Union/Russia relations, and which are crucial with regard to Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has followed recent developments in Chechnya. As Parliament will be aware, we support a political solution to the conflict and we support all genuine efforts to bring about a lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcomed the constitutional referendum in March, which we hoped would lead to a peaceful, political settlement to the conflict by providing a platform for genuine dialogue, restoration of the rule of law and the protection of human rights. It was in our view essential that the population of Chechnya should recognise the legitimacy of the presidential elections held on 5 October. But the conduct of the elections has raised many questions regarding, amongst others, due process and access to the media. Also, there are worrying reports of continuing human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we recognise the territorial integrity of Russia. But we also insist on the respect of human rights and the prosecution of those who ignore such rights. As the biggest provider of humanitarian aid to the region, the Commission is asking Russia once again to remove all obstacles to the provision of such aid and we are asking for assurances that internally displaced persons will return to Chechnya on a strictly voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in putting these points to Russian officials once again we will have a better response than we have had on the many previous occasions when we have raised them.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, Parliament requested the Commission to consider how to support reconciliation and rehabilitation. This we are doing, but the most important precondition for assistance – namely security – is simply not met at this time. In fact, the security situation in Chechnya has, if anything, deteriorated since last March, and it would be difficult even to carry out a needs assessment, let alone to start work.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully aware of the conclusions of the September meeting of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and we look forward to a new resolution on EU-Russia relations following the Oostlander report of December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking for myself, I hope that by the time I give up my present responsibilities my speaking notes for meetings with my Russian interlocutors do not cover nearly all the same points that they did four years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That border, which is 1 200 kilometres long, will grow to twice the length when the Union expands into the Baltic countries. Russia is still a modest proposition in terms of its economy, GDP being slightly greater than that of the Netherlands, but its economic potential might be said to be huge. The Union has already strengthened its cooperation with regard to energy in Russia’s direction, as we heard the Commissioner say, which is vital if we are aiming to find a replacement for North Sea energy sources, which are running out, and avoid becoming solely dependent on the Middle East’s energy resources. Russia’s incomparable wealth with regard to forests, however, as well as Siberia’s reserves of precious and colour metals, for example, will also be one of the reasons for Russia’s rise over the coming years, the other being its high achievements in the sciences and high levels of skill and know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Russia is now and will be in the future our most important neighbouring region – whatever geographical definition is applied to cooperation with neighbouring regions. In our opinion the Union has to use all the economic and intellectual means it has to try and help the advance of a stable market economy, the development of democracy and see the rule of law become established and take root in Russia, because any other sort of Russia, if it remains a nuclear superpower, would also be the greatest potential security threat to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia and the rest of Europe are bound to one another by destiny. ‘There is no great Europe without Russia and no great Russia without Europe’ was the motto employed by our party, led by the current President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, and Russia’s workgroup on progressive forces back at the start of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">Our attempts at cooperation with Russia, however, must not be allowed to eclipse the fact that we now insist on better compliance with human rights and the freedom of speech than before in Russia. This does not apply just to Chechnya, but also and above all to the Chechnya region and the war and destruction in Chechnya that continues still. No conflict is any longer solved with weapons, but political decisions instead. The United States of America can also see that in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is why we demand that Russia shows even greater political initiative and openness and that it should make considerably better use of international organisations in more open solutions to the problems of Chechnya, as Commissioner Patten also said here in his speech with regard to questions of security in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, we are not convinced that the recent elections and referenda were conducted honestly. Apparent democracy has been produced to cover up the truth, not to reveal it. In my opinion, the Council’s impression of a positive development, which Mr Frattini suggested there was, is not absolutely in keeping with the truth, and we noticed there were slight but obvious differences in the positions presented here by Commissioner Patten on the one hand and the President-in-Office on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth remembering that almost 40% of Russia’s exports come to the European Union. Just 6% go to the United States of America. Now it is estimated that after enlargement that figure will rise to 60%. At the same time, the Union’s dependence on Russia’s resources is growing: that would seem the prospect for natural gas, for example, in the next decade. It is in Russia too that economic growth these days is fastest in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian President has set two objectives in his election campaign: firstly, to create a strong central power based on the rule of law, and secondly to extend economic growth to the vast sections of Russia’s population who are poor. It is in the European Union’s interests that Russia is able to solve its huge problems, from its wide-scale poverty to human rights, freedom of the media and the war in Chechnya. We want to see that economic, political and cultural cooperation can also help us to have an impact on Russia’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also had a taste of Russian isolation. In its time it was a gift to Stalin, who pulled down the shutters and began having his own people killed. Now it is important that civil society in Russia, now in its infancy, has our support. This is precisely what many Russians are hoping to obtain from us. Let us not leave them just to get on with it! The Russian leadership claims they often listen to the messages coming from the Union more carefully than they do each other.</p>
<p class="contents">These aims will serve to allow Russia to join the World Trade Organisation as soon as possible. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement should be reviewed to correspond with today’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Chechnya, I would say that the elections were problematic, as previous ones have also been, and the Community has been unable to accept them. We propose that there should be an international conference and arbitration with regard to this matter and also that relief organisations should be allowed access to the region promptly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been hard making that a reality, as it has been a matter of a bilateral project between the EU and Russia. At the same time both sides have been developing relations of cooperation with other states. Thus, Russia has recently concluded an agreement with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan on the formation of a common economic area. The EU has its own separately agreed arrangements with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion it would be wise to try and bring together these arrangements for cooperation by establishing a broader, multilateral, economic area of cooperation, with the involvement of not only the EU and Russia but also that of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan as well as any other of the Newly Industrialised Countries willing to participate. Where appropriate the European Economic Area, which was established between the EU and EFTA, could be taken as a model. An arrangement agreed along such lines would be well suited to the EU’s evolving broader European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s new, broader European policy also offers opportunities for the development of cross-border cooperation where the EU shares a border with Russia. The Commission proposal for a new financial instrument for neighbourly cooperation will eliminate those problems which we have had harmonising internal and external financial schemes. The Russian authorities must familiarise themselves with the new financing scheme in good time so that we can be sure it will work right from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my greetings go to the Russian Government. Can you ensure that human rights are implemented in Chechnya and do your very best to seek a peaceful solution to this region’s problems! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my gratitude but also my disappointment in respect of the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">My gratitude is for the fact that the Foreign Affairs Minister has mentioned the name of Arjan Erkel without prompting. He clearly stated that he will urge the Russians to take additional steps to bring about the release of Mr Erkel, a humanitarian aid worker who has disappeared, having been abducted over a year ago. This is a message of hope, Mr Frattini; his relatives are pleased about it, and so is the organisation ‘Médecins sans Frontières’. I hope that you will certainly bring this up for discussion on 28 October in your meetings with Mr Ivanov.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, however, to give voice to some disappointment too, Mr Berlusconi. This is a statement by the Council and the Commission. I have listened very carefully to Mr Patten, who made very pertinent statements about the situation in Chechnya and about the elections in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Frattini, you only stated – and I made a note of it – that you will express your concern about the human rights situation in Chechnya. The issues involved are much worse, though. As Mr Patten quite categorically stated, those elections were not real elections. They were a sham, a farce. Those elections were not conducted in accordance with international standards, and the hope we shared with our ad hoc delegation when we returned, when we saw that a political process had indeed been put in motion, has now all but evaporated.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace will not return to Chechnya unless all factions, all clans, within the Chechen population are involved in a real peace process, in a real dialogue. Peace will not return to Chechnya unless the Russian Government is prepared to talk and enter into dialogue with the rebels, the freedom fighters. This is why I want to come back to our resolution of July, in which the express request was made for the European Union to play a significant role, with a peace conference held under its aegis, because an external player is required to ensure that the Russians and Chechens enter into real dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank you for the extra time you have given me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I trust that the Council and the Commission will clearly put this message across to President Putin. After all, what matters now is for yesterday's concessions to Iran to be realised. In this context, I should also like to touch upon a complaint made by President Putin. According to him, Russian companies have had sanctions imposed on them for supplying the nuclear sector in Iran. However, according to Putin's sources, European and American companies got off scot-free having made identical transactions. I would like to ask the Council and the Commission if this serious allegation concerning Europe's contribution is true. I should like to offer the Council and Commission a second, equally urgent item for the Summit's agenda. In the Gulf of Kerch, a serious border conflict between the Ukraine and Russia is at risk of escalating out of control. The immediate cause is the construction of a dam from the Russian peninsula Taman to the Ukrainian island of Tuzla in the Gulf of Kerch. We from the European side should make an urgent appeal to both parties for a peaceful settlement of this thorny territorial dispute. I also concur with what Mr Staes said in connection with the request that Europe should do everything possible in connection with what has happened to Arjan Erkel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish I had much more time to talk about it, but I want to concentrate upon what is most urgent, namely the issue of Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a quite specific conflict, but there are nonetheless many parallels. We see in many quarters how great powers come into conflict with population groups with different national identities. It is, of course, easy to say that this or that should be done, but I think there is a pattern to learn from.</p>
<p class="contents">We can begin by looking at ourselves – the EU and Europe. Historically, we have a lot of experience of conflicts of this type. One current example is Northern Ireland, where we are beginning to find a solution. Another example is the Basque Country. No Europeans now imagine any longer that the conflicts in the Basque Country and Northern Ireland can be resolved by military means. Political solutions have to be sought. Formulas have to be found that are acceptable to both parties, and that naturally also applies to Russia in Chechnya. That is something we have to do all in our power to emphasise. Peaceful solutions must be sought, and they must be based upon respect for self-determination on the part of the people concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">How, in practical terms, the particular conflict is then to be resolved is something the parties must discuss and agree about. No one else can solve the conflict for them. The point of departure must, however, be self-determination on the part of the people. Democracy must have grass roots support, rather than be imposed from above. It is not possible for Moscow to dictate solutions. If the Russian people do not realise this, a lot of damage will be done both to Russia and to future cooperation between Russia and the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, I should like to underline how right the two-track policy is with regard to Russia. After all, we are dealing with entirely different cooperation possibilities, which may, in turn, have an effect on Russia's political culture. It is precisely in this political culture of Russia that Chechnya fits in as an area where indeed, a failed state was created at one time – a kind of black hole in the Russian federation, where Russia had no choice but to act. The way in which this is done, however, fills us with disgust.</p>
<p class="contents">We should consider whether it would not be possible for us – maybe in the person of Mr Solana – to criticise Russia's military intervention in that country to such a degree that Russia would feel forced to change its strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The military training, the system of that military apparatus and the strategy used in Chechnya all fit into the old pattern of ruling with a rod of iron. This only breeds terrorism and results in desperate suicide acts. These are events that we have witnessed from relatively close-by in Chechnya. If we ask the acting commanding officer whether there is an alternative to this guerrilla warfare and whether there is any knowledge about this alternative method, his response is that this knowledge is available at the ministry, but he questions what good that is to them on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows that the Russians cannot appreciate why we in Europe make such a fuss about Chechnya. Despite this, it is extremely important for us to keep an eye on this aspect, because one of the areas that has been mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council, namely that of internal security, is, of course, directly connected to it. We must not, therefore, forget Chechnya. I share the view of the others who say: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with all due respect for you when you draw attention to the case of Arjan Erkel – in respect of whom it would be fantastic if you were able to solve it during your presidency – but you have to remember that Chechnya is more tragic than you have depicted it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Patten is right: the security situation over there is abominable; even aid workers will certainly not be able to operate in safety. That is why it is of vital importance that we pull out all the stops to see whether we can persuade the military, and hence the politicians, in Russia, to change the way it behaves in Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was only when the USA became the victim of targeted terror attacks, which Europe also feared, that we began to take a more nuanced view of the situation. Such a realistic approach is to be welcomed, and the summit with Russia should reinforce it.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, Commissioner, that the European Union will not always be able to exclude the issue of the CIS from the debate it wants on the European Common Area, but will have to face up to it. Even if one takes a critical view of the possibilities open to it in political dialogue on the resolution of the conflict with and within Russia in relation to Chechnya, the EU does have options, and we should make use of them primarily in order to provide effective aid for humanitarian purposes and for reconstruction, so that the hard-pressed people of Chechnya can get real help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU will shortly be importing Russian uranium. Plans are afoot to synchronise the two electricity grids. Pressure is mounting on Russian to ratify Kyoto, as otherwise the treaty is dead. In exchange, Russia will want EU support in its quest to join WTO, where there are many unresolved problems, from its dual pricing over gas to export duties and discriminatory transport fees paid to Aeroflot to overfly Siberia.</p>

First we must see law and order restored. Only then can true democracy prevail. Only Russia can deliver that. Recently, Russia signed a controversial and, in my view, regrettable single economic space agreement with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, but at the same time we now see dangerous military posturing from Russia and threats to invade as a result of the dispute over Tuzla Island in the Black Sea. I hope that this can be resolved amicably. I hope that one day we will see arrangements for a single free-market-style economic space with the EU and Russia united as one big economic entity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In making these statements, you are putting yourself at odds with what the majority in this House has thought and said for years, and also opposing the position that the majority in my party, the European People’s Party, has taken for years in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We have stood up for freedom and human rights in Chechnya, where Russia is engaged in a brutal colonial war, the second stage of which was inaugurated by President Putin in the course of the bloodiest election campaign in history. Mr Putin is, unfortunately, not going to solve the problem, for he is a quite substantial part of it. On attempting to consider the problem from the point of view of Russia’s interests, one discovers relatively quickly that Russia’s interests and Chechnya’s are in fact one and the same. Russia is suffering from financial problems; in Chechnya, billions are being senselessly squandered on a futile and bloody war. In Russia, democracy and the rule of law are suffering decline and – as Andrei Sakharov’s widow Yelena Bonner, has very powerfully described – the war in Chechnya is being taken as an opportunity for old structures to re-establish themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is suffering to a quite substantial degree from remilitarisation and the return of elements from the secret services, developments that also essentially derive from Chechnya and the war that is being waged there. Russia is suffering from terrorism and from organised crime. As Mr Oostlander so rightly said, the war in Chechnya is doing nothing to remove these problems, but is making matters worse. It can therefore be said that those who commit themselves to freedom in Chechnya and to its liberation are ultimately also committing themselves to freedom and liberation for Russia. In the long term, Russia will have to recognise that the only solution for its problems is for Chechnya to be a real democracy, and we have to see that the problem is that the pseudo-referendum that has been held there is intended to legitimise someone who was and is a villain rather than a legitimate partner in dialogue, namely President Mashadov. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I recall, in this context, an article by the Russian chess grand master Garry Kasparov on the eve of President Putin’s visit to the USA, an article that is equally relevant to the imminent summit between Russia and Europe. Its opening line went something like this: ‘Vladimir Putin comes to the USA as a great friend of democracy, of the rule of law, and of human rights. True?’, whereupon Kasparov promptly answered the rhetorical question with a polemical ‘No, false!’. He followed this up with a veritable tirade enumerating incidences of negligence and wrongdoing, arguing, for example, that Russian democracy is only a front; that the press and media are in fact made to toe the line, that liberalisation of the economy is not in fact being implemented, that potential contenders in the forthcoming presidential elections were interned on spurious charges of economic crime, and that the elections in Chechnya were a charade.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no wish to promote Mr Kasparov from chess grand master to being the yardstick by which we judge everything, but, even if one regards it as exaggerated – which was his intention – his article has to make us prick our ears up. We must not blot out unpleasant issues. Chechnya is a running sore and the grossly manipulated elections did nothing to heal it. What, then, should we be calling for? We should be calling, firstly, for an end to the lawlessness of Russian army personnel, or else it will never be possible to win the public’s confidence. Secondly, democracy must be put on a broad basis. It would be desirable if the Kremlin were, at the EU-Russia summit, to be reminded, on this point, of its most fundamental responsibility, for it is in any case President Putin who is required by the Russian constitution to guarantee human rights in the Russian Federation as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, as Mr Patten has already said – I had mentioned that the Council’s activities and the Commission’s have always moved along in parallel and in complete understanding – doubts have already been expressed regarding certain moments in the presidential elections in Chechnya, and our Russian friends have also been told quite clearly on a number of occasions that Europe is keeping a close watch on the situation inside Chechnya and on the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I think it is quite right – and the Presidency confirms this – to have continued to encourage the constitutional reform approach that President Putin has embarked on and which he confirms and maintains. At no time in my speech, which is, moreover, available for everyone to look at – as in fact I only heard in one speech by a Member – at no time did I ever say anything that could be taken to mean that I considered the whole Chechen people to be terrorists. I said the opposite: I said quite specifically that the Presidency hopes and desires that those increasingly numerous and widespread sections of the Chechen people that have no connection with terrorism should be involved in the constitutional process. I repeat: I do not believe in any way at all that the Chechen people is a terrorist people. Nevertheless, although we shall certainly talk about this point – that is, the involvement of a broad spectrum of Chechen civil society in the constitutional process – at the summit with the Russian Federation, I must also make it just as clear that there can never be any justification of any kind for those individuals – however many of them there may be – who commit terrorist acts or use themselves as human bombs to kill innocent civilians. On this point, we Europeans have always been and, I hope, will continue to be united. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
