<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, I will start with the statement that the Danube strategy is very important for the European Union, because the Danube region covers 14 countries – eight Member States and six non-Member States – which are home to more than 100 million citizens. Since the introduction of the strategy I think we have been even more convinced about the interdependence of these states and about how much they can benefit from the improved cooperation and coordination of their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have witnessed how their competitiveness could be improved if joint action is taken together, especially in the fields of SME support, labour market policies, education and security. Finally, we know very well that the Danube region has been the hot spot of the two last rounds of enlargement, and we are now using the Danube strategy to reach out to our potential new candidates in the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Communication on the EU Danube strategy was presented by the Commission in April 2011. We based it on four pillars: connecting the Danube region, protecting the environment, building prosperity and strengthening the Danube region. How far have we come after one year of implementation? The Commission is currently drafting its first report, which will be adopted early in 2013, but I would like to share with you a short preview of our current assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, my colleague, Commissioner Hahn, travelled in the region and visited several initiatives which have been started thanks to the Danube strategy. It was quite clear that with the strategy we have produced a new dynamic: new cooperation at various levels – those of political actors, the business-to-business relationship and research communities. For the first time we have seen how countries are looking for joint solutions to the common challenges and how the strategy is very quickly becoming a long-term cooperation platform.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very important for the future is how we can coordinate national and EU policies together. A clear example of how this could be done was the joint work of the Ministers of Transport, who adopted a declaration on the maintenance of the Danube waterway, which is a commitment to very concrete actions to improve the situation on the Danube.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is helping with providing new possibilities for renewing the Danube fleet, how to make it more modern and greener. We are helping to set up a Danube research and innovation fund to help researchers. The Joint Research Centre is currently setting up a Danube-wide set of data to improve decision-making for these actions and the gathering of environmental data. We are very pleased that police cooperation is also becoming a key priority for the Member States in the Danube region. And what must not be overlooked is how we can jointly promote a Danube tourism brand for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">These are only some examples. Yesterday Commissioner Hahn opened a new bridge between Romania and Bulgaria, the Calafat-Vidin Bridge. I think it is very important to say that this is only the second crossing point at the border, which is longer than 600 kilometres.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in the future we will see far more concrete transnational projects, because there are already more than 50 projects which have been studied and labelled as the Danube regional projects and now they are waiting for the decision on how they will be financed and implemented in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of financing is of course crucial to further success. The strategy cuts across different Commission policies, and therefore we are trying to introduce the element of the macro-region into our future common strategic frameworks, partnership contracts and operational programmes, where we would need to see how financing could also be targeted at these very important Danube projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall that there was a clear request from the Council and the European Parliament to evaluate the concept of the macro-regional strategies by mid-2013. This will be a very important moment in terms of assessing how successful this concept is.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to thank the European Parliament for very instrumental work and support, and for its technical assistance to the Danube strategy, which is very much appreciated by the recipients and by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A more powerful Europe therefore means a more integrated and more united Europe. The answer is clear: more Europe. Last week, President Barroso said in Bucharest that progress had been made in this regard, but it was not enough. Allies of cohesion and supporters of better spending must form a coalition to bring about growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danube Strategy offers a unique opportunity through which stakeholders in competitiveness regions and convergence regions are uniting in support of this common goal. The challenges raised by the Danube macro-regional strategy consist of unprecedented measures through which it is possible to check the performance of the EU’s integrated policies, through the involvement of stakeholders in riparian regions within a multi-level governance framework. The reinvigoration of the Danube-Rhine corridor is facilitating the transportation of goods within the EU and is creating openness towards the east and third countries. The resulting advantages are helping to make Danube regions more competitive, supporting sustainability objectives by reducing transportation by land and creating employment opportunities. Of course, the strategy is also bringing socio-cultural benefits. Promoting the legacy of the Danube’s cultural heritage could lead to the creation of a Danube brand.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we currently face certain obstacles to the implementation of this strategy. Yesterday, on the building site of the Calafat-Vidin Bridge over the Danube, Commissioner Hahn said that more connections were needed along a stretch measuring more than 650 kilometres, where there is currently just one bridge. For us to be able to call the strategy a success, we need to prioritise the removal of obstacles to cross-border connectivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask you a question. The Commission’s position on the Danube Strategy is clear: no additional funds without the enactment of new laws and without other administrative structures. Do you think, though, that certain aspects of the Commission’s position are worth revising if the concrete results of the evaluations are positive? Similarly, for a new impetus, as you mentioned, does the Commission envisage direct intervention measures where hold-ups at inter-regional or, in particular, cross-border level are identified? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Danube Strategy – one of the greatest achievements of Hungary’s Presidency of the EU – is held in high regard by all countries in Central Europe and on the Danube, because cooperation is what is lacking the most in this region. It is great that the Danube Strategy has finally prompted the Danube states to work more closely together in the fields of transport, irrigation, shipping and tourism. It is very important to make the Danube navigable for shipping, and in this respect my own country, Hungary, has important things to do as well.</p>
<p class="contents">What is just as important for Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and all the Danube countries, though, is to use the Danube for irrigation purposes, as we barely use this irrigation capacity. Moreover, it is fantastic that in the second pillar of the reformed common agricultural policy EU funding will be available for rural development. This could act as a further incentive for all Danube countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Danube Forum, of which I am the Chair, has 60 MEPs. Therefore, I am pleased to be the first signatory of the oral question to put the subject of the Danube on today’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been some progress with regard to the Danube, such as the bridges I saw this summer between Widin and Calafat, on the international Danube bicycle tour. However, this progress is moving at a snail’s pace. There are still major difficulties: mayors in Bulgaria tell us that construction works on the Danube require consultation with seven ministries in Sofia. Other Danube residents have the impression in their Member States that the Danube is being marginalised in capital cities and not being placed in the foreground.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are asking the Commission for more substantial results and measures. In the current programming period, the Danube Strategy should be provided with resources and for the future period we need a dedicated budget line for the Danube. We have specific projects, such as the Danube Manager, for which administration capacity needs to be developed. Small and medium-sized enterprises should be supported while they cooperate. There should be technology transfer centres.</p>
<p class="contents">More than anything else, we need more opportunities for citizens to meet. We note that these citizens’ meetings must be supported otherwise they do not function. I have written to Chancellor Merkel and Commissioner Lewandowski to propose the formation of a Danube Youth Foundation. I therefore pose the question: can the Commission imagine itself financially supporting such a Danube Youth Foundation? Many young people would like to meet up, but cannot afford the tank of petrol or the train tickets they need to get to a meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, parliaments should play a greater role. I hope that we in the European Parliament will act as leaders and invite the other national and regional parliaments to join in, so that we, too, take greater ownership of the Danube Strategy than ever before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us MEPs it is not always easy to obtain relevant and timely information – and this is even harder for civil society. This civil society in all the countries along the Danube is now being asked to get involved and co-design the implementation of the EU strategy for the Danube region, but how can they do this if they do not receive prompt and comprehensive information on the status of this implementation? Therefore, I ask the Commissioners, together with the partner countries, to make a special effort so that we receive relevant information from you on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also ask you to reply to a written question that I and my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asked in July 2011. The question concerns navigability, in particular with regard to development of the free-flowing Danube in Bavaria between Straubing and Vilshofen. This is a particularly valuable nature reserve and a habitat for many endangered species. The valuable alluvial forests there would be completely destroyed by the dams. From a transport perspective, any development is totally pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Hahn answered the question in September 2011 but not every part of it. In particular, he did not reply to this question: what measures is the Commission taking to ensure transparency in decision-making and implementing bodies and the independence of expert groups? You know that local residents are fighting for a free-flowing Danube, so it is vital to gain clarity on which stakeholders could be influencing the independence of experts.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The vision for the macroregion is not concerned with industrial and rural development based on these criteria, but with the deepening of the capitalist single market and capitalist restructurings which have led people into unemployment, mass poverty and bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="contents">These actions serve the antipopular Europe 2020 strategy and the energy giants, drawing off significant funding for the benefit of the ‘Interconnecting Europe’ plan.

I think that, in its assessment and in its macroeconomic screening, the Commission must at all costs place special emphasis on the Connecting Europe programme, particularly in the areas of road and rail construction and air transport connections, since relevant resources are available for this. They must be used meaningfully here: these resources and this programme can do a lot for this area and for the entire region – this can also make an impact on the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Prime Minister Borisov, Prime Minister Ponta and Commissioner Hahn gave an example of why we need the Danube Strategy: to unlock the potential for a higher standard of living for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Having started, we must now put taking stock of achievements, analysing the challenges, and building a solid foundation for future action on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to remind you once again that the Strategy is a focus for the watchful eyes of millions of people from the Danube countries. I see them also in my country, Bulgaria, every month when we hold round-table meetings with the Ministry of Regional Development to discuss opportunities for developing Europe’s regions through implementation of the Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In these meetings people’s expectations materialise before our own eyes: roads and river ports; clean air, soil and water; cultural, historical and tourist sites; youth education centres; functioning small and medium size enterprises. What else do we need?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, political willingness to bring the Danube Strategy to a successful conclusion. Have courage, Commissioner: the European Parliament will support you.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, joint action, coordinated and clearly defined deadlines, objectives and responsibilities. And thirdly, specific projects to resolve joint problems, together with simplified procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things are important for me:</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw special attention to the participation of young people in the Danube Strategy. These are the people of the future, the carriers of creativity and innovation. They can give the Danube Strategy an extra boost to meet its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need strategic investment. Here we are voting on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. Commissioner, what resources can we rely on?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that it is only with adequate resources, very precise and coordinated action and clear priorities and strategic investment that we can turn the strategy of three ‘no’s’ into a strategy of three ‘yes’s’: ‘yes’ to better use of funds, ‘yes’ to better coordination between institutions, and ‘yes’ to new ideas implemented in concrete projects that improve the life of the people along the Danube. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely this positive engagement by the people living along the Danube that has led to the creation of this highly active macro-region. As I understand it, the bottom-up approach was applied very successfully in designing the strategy for the Danube region. The European Parliament was the driving force in this process. It is vitally important that we continue to support the desire and commitment of the population in the current implementation phase of the strategy. The strategy for the Danube region must not be filed away but must be translated into actual projects together with the people on the ground and brought to life. That is why your statement today is so important, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">The declared aim of the strategy is to create prosperity and employment along the Danube. The future of the whole Danube area will be sustainably created through increased networking, especially through infrastructure and through intensive exchange. In my view, the areas of economic and educational cooperation are key aspects. The participating actors along the Danube will benefit from cooperation on economic/technical projects and from educational and social measures. With this aim in mind, Europe-wide alignment of the higher education system with bachelor’s and master’s degrees, as well as dual training, should be intensified in the Danube region. I think that my federal state, Baden-Württemberg, is a good example of this. </p>
<p class="contents">After 2013 I would like to see the strategy for the Danube region and its structural networks integrated in all regional policy measures. Commissioner, this is the future of a part of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A bad example of this is the catastrophe two years ago when contaminated sludge from a Hungarian aluminium factory flowed into the Danube. It became obvious in that case how important cooperation is.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, seamless transport connections are especially important. As co-rapporteur of the report on the development of the trans-European transport network, I consider inland navigation as an important means of transport, because it is environmentally friendly and still has potential for growth. At the same time, we must also comply with emissions targets. We cannot expand at any cost. This means that we must place ecological considerations and environmental protection in the foreground and at the heart of this process. </p>
<p class="contents">We have heard today that one of the last free-flowing sections of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is this kind of bad example. In my view, the environment must take precedence here. In the meantime, the CSU environment minister in the government of the state of Bavaria has recognised this. Now he has to convince his Bavarian Prime Minister and the Federal Transport Minister that any investment in further studies is unnecessary and that any investment – I refer here to the EUR 16.5 million which the Commission has also invested in this study – is, unfortunately, money spent in vain. It would be better spent – as Mr Theurer has mentioned – in the Danube Youth Foundation. This is the direction we need to take in future.</p>

This underlines the importance of the Danube Strategy as it symbolises the cohesion and solidarity between the western and eastern sides of the continent. The strategy for the Danube region should be considered as an implementation plan of the EU cohesion policy for one group of countries. All that remains is to flesh out the strategy with content and specific projects aimed at the joint, coordinated development of countries in the region and the rebirth of Central Europe. This offers a good opportunity to re-think the cohesion priorities to ensure that the investments implemented are definitely those which will bear fruit in the long run and improve standards of living for our citizens.</p>

Just a few weeks ago a list was sent to the Member States of specific projects which could be implemented jointly as part of this cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has already happened: in this area, where 115 million Europeans live, more than 275 projects are now under way. There is already very good cooperation at the administrative level and at the level of the Member States and local communities involved. </p>
<p class="contents">However, this Danube strategy has not succeeded for the people, the citizens. A few days ago, in Lower Austria, at Danube University Krems, we took part in a conference entitled ‘Focusing on people’. The task before us today is to develop this Danube region strategy further such that it can be carried on by civil society. We need to make efforts to ensure that the cohesion of this region and mutual understanding grow. What is also very important is that we need the development of the Danube. We need it because we only use about 10 % of its transport capacity. However, we may do this only if nature and biological diversity are really taken into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It contributes to the identification of coordinated solutions to environmental, transport and economic growth problems in the region. The Strategy has made it possible to develop infrastructure projects which are particularly important for the whole region. One of them is the Calafat-Vidin Bridge, which was co-financed with European funds and is due to be completed in 2013. Another important project is the tourist mini-port in Sfântu Gheorghe, which was inaugurated in 2011 and will boost tourism in the Danube Delta significantly. These are clear pieces of evidence of the way in which the Danube Strategy is driving cooperation in the region forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are also a number of failings, particularly with regard to the funding available. The Union’s future budget should provide separate financing for the Strategy and the projects devised as part of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will try to respond to four major topics which were raised: management and financing, environment and transport, transparency, democratic scrutiny and the treatment of youth, and, of course, reporting and implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">First I would really like to thank everyone for their interventions, because it is very rare that one feels such overwhelming support for our common work. I think all Members believe that Europe needs the Danube strategy and that the strategy still has a lot to offer and that we are actually only starting to grasp the potential of what we can achieve through this macro-regional approach – as was said by the President – to our common history, common past and also, I believe, common future.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to continue to the questions raised by Mr Matula, Mr Tabajdi and Mr Toia concerning the management of financing and environment. What will be very important, of course, is to achieve a good solution on 22 and 23 November, and at subsequent negotiations with the European Parliament on the multiannual financial framework. This will only be the start, though, because if we want to succeed in this effort it will be quite important to have very close collaboration with the Member States and with the regions. We need to work on planning together what should be the key projects to be carried out under the umbrella of the Danube strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very helpful if funds could be earmarked for the projects now, so that we know the list of priority projects and what is important for the Danube regions and know which projects we would like to see implemented and financed through the cohesion and Structural Funds in the next period.</p>
<p class="contents">What we will try to do in the Commission will be to use the fact that this approach is already included in the draft regulations on cohesion policies, and we will do our best to include these in the common strategic frameworks, in the partnerships contracts and in the operational programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The question was asked by Mr Toia and Mr Matula on how the Commission might be more closely involved in the planning and preparation of these projects. We consider that we can do this through our involvement in the drafting of partnership agreements and through our common management under the common strategic frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">We realise that, as was said during the debate, in several Member States the absorption capacity of EU funding is not the best. We could do a lot by managing those funds better, synergising and offering additional technical assistance to those Member States which clearly have a problem with absorbing EU structural funding. I believe that this is something on which we have to focus, not least via the financial regulations which were approved today, which offer new ways of simplifying the whole procedure, and through which we should definitely achieve much better results in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the environmental and transport, the key issue is always how to balance environmental aspects and navigational needs when it comes to such important waterways as the Danube. I agree that it is very important to use independent expertise, which is always how the Commission approaches these issues. It is also important to involve the public in the discussions and find out how citizens would like to reconcile the environmental aspects and also navigational needs in their regions. Therefore, the issue of democratic scrutiny and closer involvement of national and regional parliaments and the public in these debates is very important – not only from this point of view but also from that of what the EU can actually achieve through the good implementation of the Danube strategy in specific regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a question on orienting more of our attention towards youth. I agree with that fully because there is a high unemployment rate across Europe and we can see how young people can benefit from youth programmes. Priority area No 7 is focused exactly on these issues and is about bringing together universities, introducing common Masters and PhD programmes for young people and also strengthening youth mobility programmes in the Danube region, which would be a very good opportunity for young people to get to know each other better and also to look for further opportunities for studying and later on for work.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the question on the Danube waterway and its corridor priority, I would like to confirm that the Danube waterway is in the TEN-T network and therefore it will be treated as a priority project under the next multiannual financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The last set of questions was aimed at how we would report, how we would inform Parliament on what has been done under the Danube strategy. As I said, we are now working on the assessment of the first year of implementation, and I can assure you that the report will be prepared well before June next year. I hope that we will find in it a lot of experience that can be used for the next period and also a lot of retrospective on what could have been done better under the current period. I hope that it will also serve as an inspiration for the new project and the new activities we can pursue under the Danube strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The entire process of European integration can to some extent be regarded as an expression of awareness of the regional factor – problems and benefits which, by virtue of geographical proximity, cannot be addressed by countries acting in isolation. It is particularly important for the Danube region, which is a historic focus of development of the civilisation and economy of Europe, to develop its potential and once again become a primary axis of the European Union. The development by the European Union of a strategy for this region which encompasses many sectors is important not just from the point of view of the complex sectors addressed – the environment, transport, economy or governance. The EU Strategy for the Danube Region has a major role, because it truly puts the institutional capacity and direct benefits of the integration project to the test. What many states in the region want is not necessarily a contribution of material, human or financial resources, but a real transfer of expertise and experience. Environmental protection, the development of a more interconnected public transport system or the construction of an integrated and efficient environmental protection system require, first and foremost, institutional consolidation of the cooperation process, along with the extension of best practice in the target sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Danube has played a crucial role in the political, socio-economic and cultural development of central and south-eastern Europe. It is the most international river basin in the world, covering 817 000 km<span class="sup">2</span>, a third of Europe, and crossing 18 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danube is overwhelmingly important for Europe’s biodiversity. The Danube Delta is home to more than 5 200 species of flora and fauna. However, the river and its wildlife have suffered considerable losses, especially over the last century. At present, the Danube basin covers just 20 % of the area which was originally covered by water, only half of which still has natural characteristics in the true sense of the word. Many areas are polluted, and defective sewerage systems and buildings have increased the risk of flooding and exacerbated the problems caused by pollution.

Covering one fifth of EU territory, the Danube region’s wellbeing is inextricably linked to that of the Union as a whole. Many of the region’s problems know no borders, and these all demand a united approach. I am convinced that the economic disparities and under-investment in infrastructure need to be addressed. The fact that migration, climate change and security can have a particularly intense impact in the area owing to the region’s political and geographical characteristics should also not be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental issues are particularly pressing for both reasons of biodiversity and to protect cultural heritage. It is important to embrace the Danube Strategy as a problem that addresses a priority. It represents the solution presented by people living in the region for people living in the region. There are four priorities: connecting the Danube region, protecting the environment in the Danube region, building prosperity in the Danube region, and strengthening the Danube region. The strategy was established as the second EU macro-regional approach, and is similar to the strategy for the Baltic Sea region.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this strategy presents an opportunity to implement a long-term recovery programme for the Danube region and the more efficient exploitation of the potential of the Danube countries. Through appropriate partnership and cooperation with the countries of this area it is possible to strive to improve people’s lives, and to increase their social security and cohesion. Equally important is the support for cross-border cooperation and the removal of barriers to bringing the people and countries of the Danube region closer together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
