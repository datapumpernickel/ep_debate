The European Union is making every effort to ensure that, on that occasion, a new trade round will commence on the basis of a broad and balanced agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the conclusions reached by the General Affairs Council on 26 October 1999 will remain a point of reference. The General Affairs Council of 8 October has underlined the importance of a new trade round.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week’s General Affairs Council will once again examine the state of affairs. It is indeed important for a strong and united Union to leave for Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know, of course, that it is the Commission that negotiates in matters of trade on behalf of the European Union – as is the case here – and that Commissioner Lamy, who will be taking the floor after me, plays an absolutely crucial and, in any case, very valued role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">For your information, I should like to add that the topic of the preparation of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation has also been discussed during the Social Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council, and, if I am not mistaken, this will also be done at the Environment Council, with a view to harmonising the positions, or at least, to being informed of the different sensitive issues.</p>
<p class="contents">A new round of broad-based negotiations must enable progress to be made in the further liberation and regulation of world trade, which is vital for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Conference will be taking place against a backdrop of a slowing down world economy, a situation which has been exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September which are having a negative impact on economic growth in both the industrial and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement on the start of a new round will thus give the world economy a powerful and positive signal. Even during the most recent informal Council in Ghent, the EU Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission urged, and I quote: “to work actively towards launching of the WTO negotiations. The current economic uncertainty means that trade liberalisation founded on a rules-based multilateral system and associated with a real development dimension is more important than ever, economically and politically” – end of quote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new round of trade negotiations is also extremely important for the developing countries. The round must enable us to improve the integration of developing countries, and especially the least developed countries, into the multilateral trade system, particularly by providing better market access, through measures that facilitate the implementation of agreements that have already been reached, and also through measures that seek to make more operational the special and differential treatment given to these countries. Thirdly, a new round will aim to strengthen the WTO rules-based system, by clarifying and explaining existing provisions, particularly with regard to trade and the environment, and by extending the WTO’s scope to new areas such as investment, competition and trade facilitation, so that the WTO adjusts to the needs that have come about due to changes in the global economy and so that it responds to the concerns arising from globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will also attempt to promote multilateral governance by ensuring increased coherence and improved cooperation of the WTO with other international organisations, particularly with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in order to help to improve the way that globalisation is controlled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> I should like to underline that consequently, the European Union not only seeks to further liberalise world trade, it also seeks to further regulate world trade. In fact, that reflects public opinion in the Member States perfectly. Non-trade issues, further progress in terms of transparency of the World Trade Organisation mechanism, the preservation of the European model of government services and the special statute of those services are some of the interests which the European Union protects.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the developing countries, a serious effort has been made over the past three years on the issue surrounding implementation. That has made it possible to identify the relevant themes. In some cases, these concern the application of the agreements, or a slight adjustment or interpretation of the text to be specified.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases, these concern points which could well result in a formal change to the existing agreements. All this slows down the process. It is a process in which the European Union takes an active part, and is fully aware that this forms a key component for many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that, alongside this effort involving the developing countries, an effort must also be made involving the so-called ‘rich countries’ which were originally, up until the beginning of this year, absolutely unconvinced – some more than others – of the fact that there is a real problem of implementation with regard to the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission action plan in this area was approved by the General Affairs Council last May. The European Union is working hard so that a clear statement on access to medicines and on the TRIPS agreement can be adopted at the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the WTO consultations are focusing on the draft Ministerial Declaration and on the draft decision on implementation-related issues. Two documents, which were tabled on 26 September by Stuart Harbison, the Chairman of the WTO General Council. Many of the WTO members consider these documents to be a good basis for our work, and they will be amended in line with the negotiations that have taken place since they were published.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Union is concerned, the draft Ministerial Declaration will take into account a whole raft of subjects that we consider to be crucial. The document still, however, falls short of expectations in several areas. Commissioner Pascal Lamy will no doubt comment on this issue in his speech, and the Commission will continue to strive to ensure that the Ministerial Declaration responds to the European Union’s concerns and interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We are taking an active part in the negotiations on the agenda of the new round with an open and flexible approach, and we are also particularly concerned about assisting developing countries whilst protecting the legitimate aims and objectives of the European Union.

There are two weeks to go before the conference opens and some lively discussions are now going on in Geneva and elsewhere on the negotiating programme that will be launched. I would now like to say that, as negotiator for the European Union, it is very important to me that the European Parliament actively participates in this debate. As you know, we fought together, at the previous Intergovernmental Conference – at which the Treaty of Nice, as we call it, was draw up – in order to enhance Parliament’s competences in the area of trade policy. As you also know, the Member States did not adopt our proposals. In these circumstances, the Commission is doing everything in its power, within the framework imposed on us by the Treaty, to inform the European Parliament and to involve it in the Union’s trade policy. You also know that we are in favour of creating a consultative parliamentary body at the WTO, to enhance the role of Members in the multilateral trading system. I am convinced that, if we want the support of public opinion, if we want to improve the WTO’s legitimacy, then enhancing the role of Members in the WTO’s work is not only possible, but also, and above all, it is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what is in the negotiating programme proposed by the European Union? On several occasions over the last two years, since Seattle, we have had the opportunity to come together to discuss the progress of preparations for the forthcoming Ministerial Conference. The exchanges of views that we have had here or in committee have given us food for thought as to which strategy should be applied. The considerations and concerns that you have voiced during these meetings are very similar to those of the Commission. Like us, you want a negotiating programme on the liberalisation of trade and investment, to meet the needs of our exporters and those of developing countries. But, like us, you also want an agenda that focuses on the drafting of new rules, the clarification of current rules and the linking-up of World Trade Organisation rules and those of other international bodies in the areas of society, the environment, health or food safety. It is these rules that will provide greater market efficiency, better social development and sufficient environmental protection. We believe that the key to sustainable development of the planet as a whole hinges on our ability to combine the opening-up of the markets with the application of multilateral rules. This is why there are three subjects on the agenda supported by the European Union since the Seattle meeting. These are market access, regulation and the integration of developing countries; the unity of these three subjects is guaranteed by what is called the single undertaking. Lastly, we want to hold intense negotiations and come to swift conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Some may be surprised that the tragic events of 11 September have changed neither course nor our schedule. I would like to briefly explain this. Even before 11 September, we believed that an approach based on the principle of well-ordered liberalisation was required. This has become even more necessary since the terrorist attacks took place. The process of opening up markets, regulating trade, integrating developing countries and the concern to ensure environmental and social sustainability – we need these more now than ever before. These are issues of stability and security, both in relations between countries and between generations. Dialogue, negotiation and peaceful resolution to commercial conflicts have made international trade a laboratory for international governance, where each partner participates in decision-making. Faced with the instability caused by the attacks, we must further strengthen the importance of the multilateral dimension, which we believe to be the best way to give today’s de facto globalisation a legal status. Of course, the WTO is only one of the pillars making up a multilateral system, which must meet the challenges of globalisation. A round of World Trade Organisation negotiations is therefore necessary, of course, but it is in no way sufficient. We must also strengthen the other institutions of governance, the environment, social development, development funding and policy support agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now consider the prospects for the Ministerial Conference, which will take place in two weeks’ time. Generally speaking, I think that we are in a better position than we were at this stage before the Seattle conference. The preparatory work is being carried out in a spirit of positive cooperation. The belief that the multilateral system must now, more than ever, be an essential part of growth and prosperity is widely shared. And I think we must also point out that the open, constructive spirit and the efforts made by many partners – such as ourselves, the United States, and an increasing number of developing countries – have already helped to partly reconcile the differing views that prevented Seattle from being a success. This came across very clearly at the last informal select meeting of WTO trade ministers, which was held in Singapore on 13 and 14 October and which I attended. I feel that this was also correctly reflected at the meeting of APEC trade ministers (Pacific-rim countries) that took place last week. I think that we have now reached a point where we can envisage an ambitious, balanced round that meets the primary objectives of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have not yet achieved this goal. We are now entering the final and crucial stage, in the run-up to Doha. As you know, a draft Ministerial Declaration, which will constitute the framework of negotiations for the new round, was published on 26 September 2001. All the members of the WTO considered this document to be a sound basis for moving forward. Of course, no one was fully satisfied, which, if you are familiar with the culture at the WTO, is more or less a good sign prior to negotiations. Obviously, not everything in this document is acceptable, not even for us, and I shall outline to you the main areas of difficulty, which require further work.</p>
<p class="contents">The first difficulty concerns trade and the environment, areas that give us particular cause for concern due to the lack of ambitious proposals. Clearly, we hope to make the framework for negotiation much more substantial. Progress is being made in some areas, but we must admit that most of our partners in developing countries are still hesitant, to say the least, about the idea of accepting negotiations on this subject. We shall do everything we can in the following days to improve this situation. I also made it clear to my colleagues, in Singapore, that a framework on this issue was not only a political necessity for the European Union, but should also be of interest to all the members of the World Trade Organisation and of the multilateral system as a whole. I think that the message concerning the political importance that this question holds for us has got through. We still need to draw operational consequences from this. The second difficulty, after environment, is agriculture, which is still a very sensitive subject. The draft declaration before us seems to pre-empt the outcome of the negotiations in several respects, since it aims, in particular, to phase out subsidy categories, which goes further than the framework that Franz Fischler and myself received…</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not completely satisfied with some aspects of the statement either, specifically with the way it deals with the social domain. We feel that it is treated too sparingly and should be extended to more appropriately reflect the importance of this issue for our societies and our own ambition, for such is the mandate I was given, to establish an international and multi-institutional dialogue on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to investment and competition, we are unhappy with one of the options put forward, which is to limit ourselves to working programmes. In our opinion, working programmes cannot replace negotiations, even if it does make sense that there should be a connection between a working programme and a negotiation, provided, of course, that this is agreed in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the relationship between health and intellectual property, which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned, is also problematic. As you know, we are very committed to this matter and we are working actively on reconciling the more extreme positions so that a substantial political statement can be agreed on in Doha, reconciling the flexibility of the agreement on intellectual property with, on the one hand, the need of developing countries for access to essential medicines and, on the other, the concern to ensure that innovation through research can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">These are our concerns and other delegations will obviously have their own concerns about the ministerial statement. For a number of developing countries, the implementation of existing WTO agreements, or in many cases, their adaptation, is of the utmost importance and we must, we feel, be willing to respond openly and creatively to these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the least advanced countries have a real problem of lack of capacity and resources and a solution must be found to this problem in the future work of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the concerns that I have highlighted, most of the WTO member countries seem increasingly willing to show the necessary flexibility and openness to sufficiently conduct ambitious negotiations in Doha in terms of substance, and I am beginning to think that we might be able to see our four priorities met there: trade liberalisation, further regulation, the inclusion of development at the top of the multilateral agenda and the integration of our objectives for sustainable development into the WTO. All of these aspects are designed to ensure that we give greater consideration to our fellow citizens’ concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I hope that the resolution you will be voting on tomorrow will provide clear and powerful support for these European Union objectives. With a vote in favour, you will be strengthening our negotiating hand and sending a political signal to our trading partners and to the general public, that the European Union will not simply be taking a ‘business as usual’ approach to these negotiations<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome, on behalf of the Commission, the Members of this Parliament who will be joining our delegation to Doha, and the positive and cooperative approach between us that I would say we developed in Seattle. This is, in any event, the result of the questionnaire that I sent to you at the time, to which most members of the delegation replied, and I count on your active support to promote what is, in my view, our common agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows that on certain major questions a general view predominates over party lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not seen much of Commissioner Pascal Lamy over the past few months, and for once I can say that we are glad about this. He had energetically and skilfully shuttled all over the world trying to create a basis for a new WTO negotiation round; on which a decision needs to be taken in Doha in mid-November. In the midst of all this, however, Commissioner Lamy has found time to do a good and adequate job of briefing the Parliamentary delegation that is leaving for Doha. We must thank him for this also; of course I was not to know that his message is so explosive that a fire drill would have to be arranged during it.</p>
<p class="contents">My group fully supports the negotiation line that the Council had already decided for the Seattle conference. The new negotiation round to develop the liberalisation of world trade and rules of the game must treat matters on a broad basis so that we can strengthen sustainable economic growth; reinforce, develop and renew a trading system based on global rules; and ensure that its benefits are shared out equitably. We are also happy with the idea that the meeting will be held in Qatar. Now, if ever, it must be shown that we cannot be intimidated by terrorism; instead, we shall continue – on the 'business as usual' principle – with our policies of international cooperation for the sake of freer and fairer trade. This must also work towards a better environment, social development, the reduction of poverty, and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who would like to eliminate free trade, abolish the WTO and return to bilaterally regulated trade. This road, ladies and gentlemen, would be a road to protectionism, and then on to trade wars and also, subsequently, to possible armed conflicts. It would be a road which would make all enemies of freedom, democracy, the State under the rule of law, social development and human rights nod with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all my colleagues who have worked so hard in order to bring about a Parliamentary meeting in connection with the Doha meeting. I would like to mention by name my colleagues Erika Mann and Konrad Schwaiger. We have heard today that there is still uncertainty about the mission from the United States Congress. We must indeed hope that at least as strong a delegation arrives from the United States Congress as from here; without them we will be a bit one-sided. I believe that during the next few years we can develop Parliamentary monitoring of world trade; this is important in order to open up to citizens the work of an organisation such as the WTO and, through this, to seeking approval of the activity falling within its sphere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it appears that Doha has sounded the alarm bells here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past two years, the WTO has been under fire on many occasions, with good reason. Some of the critics claim that there is so much wrong with the WTO that we should not start a new trade round until the problems surrounding, for example, fair access to the world market for developing countries, the lack of democracy and decision-making within the WTO and the imbalance between trade and non-trade issues have been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Social-Democrats, however, have reached the opposite conclusion. These problems must be solved as an absolute priority, and it is precisely by starting a new trade round that this can be achieved most effectively. Only then will reform be truly possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group gives its unqualified support to a new trade round with a broad-based agenda aimed at economic and political reform. It is quite simple: we know that trade stimulates growth, attracts investment and creates employment, both within and outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The world economy is now poised between recession and recovery. The recession as a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September gives the perpetrators ultimate triumph. Who stands to suffer most from these attacks? The world’s poorest of the poor. The World Bank expects that the terrorist attacks will cut economic growth in the developing countries from 5 to 2.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">The expected growth and effects are approximately another ten million people under the poverty line and an added 20 000 to 40 000 children under five who will die. That is a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">A new trade round is necessary in order to restore confidence in the world economy to some extent and to open the way to renewed sustainable growth. We also know, however, that trade on its own is not enough. Without an adequate regulating mechanism, we run too great a risk of the trade benefits being distributed very unevenly indeed and of the environment and social standards coming off worst.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why in the negotiations with other groups on the resolution, we, as the PSE Group, insisted that the Fourth Ministerial Conference’s first priority should be to tackle worldwide poverty, reforms, democracy and the relationship between trade and non-trade issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Think of the impact of the WTO rules on matters such as the environment, safe food, workers’ rights or the freedom of governments to regulate public services without running the risk of being taken to court by profit-seeking multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">To the Social-Democrats, the fundamental objective of institutions such as the WTO is to bring worldwide processes such as globalisation under political control, enabling us to steer these processes in accordance with democratic, political choices.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore our greatest challenge, together with many developing countries, together with many reform-minded and sound NGOs, in the face of opposition from the neo-Liberals, but also from a number of our fellow MEPs here in Parliament and that section of the anti-globalists who oppose a new round, to start this new round nevertheless.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fourth Ministerial Conference is a key moment in the debate on globalisation, including the socio-economic security aspects of this debate. If the programme for the forthcoming three-yearly trade round compiled at the Ministerial Conference does not provide a solid basis for progress in the field of democracy, the fight against poverty, environmental protection, growth in developing countries and the protection of public services, then we, as Social-Democrats, fear the worst for the course of the current debate on globalisation, and eventually the very concept of globalisation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message of the resolution which, we hope, will be adopted tomorrow. We support a new trade round. We are in favour of free trade which is fair and supports the citizens throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about the acid test in all of this. We hope that those cheap medicines which the President talked about in plain terms will also prove to be a true test, for without it we cannot imagine that this new round could be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish Mr Pascal Lamy every success, for he is doing fantastically well so far. He has a great relationship with our Parliament, for which we are very grateful to him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope it will bear fruit in a couple of weeks' time. As a group we are also very keen that we should learn the lessons from Seattle and not use the launch of the round, or the text for the launch of the round, to somehow foreshadow or preclude the conclusion of the round. That is obviously a lesson well-learnt and we applaud the attempts to keep the document which will be discussed in Doha as crisp and brief as possible. I am not entirely sure whether the principles of brevity and crispness have been fully respected in our own resolution, but this is certainly something we hope you will follow in Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two issues of absolutely fundamental importance to us as a Liberal group. Firstly, trade and the environment: for us issues such as the interaction between trade and multilateral environmental agreements, eco-labelling, the incorporation of the precautionary principle are not add-ons or luxuries, they are absolutely fundamental to the future credibility of the WTO and, arguably, of globalisation as a political process itself. We feel strongly, therefore, that without those kinds of provisions in the next round of negotiations, it will simply become politically unsellable and unsustainable within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly on agriculture, our own views are that paragraphs 23 to 25, whilst just above adequate, are a little convoluted and mealy-mouthed on agriculture. We prefer the emphasis in paragraph 6 because it draws attention to the fundamental fact, highlighted recently by a study from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, that the greatest instrument to alleviate poverty is the further liberalisation of agriculture. That is a fundamental principle for us which we hope will be fully respected in the next round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Our group has not signed the compromise resolution with the larger groups for a number of reasons, but the most important one is this: We believe that fundamental reform of the World Trade Organisation's processes and rules must be a precondition for any new round of trade talks. Reform is not something that can be simply addressed as one issue among many in a new multilateral trade round where it risks being traded off against other interests and demands. In our view, the WTO faces such a crisis of legitimacy in public opinion that reform must come before any further negotiations, and that is the position we have put forward in our joint resolution with the GUE Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that is not a tactic for putting off indefinitely the start of a new round. In our view, nothing has slowed down the WTO more than the debacle in Seattle which was caused in no small part by the chaotic and exclusive structures, rules and procedures of the WTO. So, for those who believe in multilateral trade rules, as we do, serious reform is not an option but a necessity. The lessons of the failed Seattle Ministerial were that the WTO must become a fully democratic and transparent organisation which genuinely supports sustainable development and which effectively responds to the needs of developing countries. They need to be far bigger players in the WTO. Their marginalisation needs to end and they need to be listened to. In recent weeks, many poorer countries have made it clear that for them addressing concerns about the implementation of Uruguay Round commitments should be a precondition for a new round. Just two days ago, a communication from the G77 reiterated that position.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group agrees with developing countries when they oppose new issues on the agenda on the grounds that expanding that agenda would over stretch the capacity of many developing countries which are already struggling to participate effectively in the WTO process. It would distract attention from the unfinished development business and increase the risk that developing countries will end up accepting disadvantageous trade-offs. The possible opt-outs that are on offer are not a realistic or effective way of dealing with these concerns, since developing countries still do not have the capacity now to affect the negotiations of an agreement which they may be later under pressure to sign. Pressing ahead with a new trade round in the face of major opposition from the majority of developing countries is not helpful. Simply calling it a development round without genuinely addressing the demands of developing countries is a sleight of hand that fails to address their real concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our group agrees that strong international rules are needed to manage trade. We agree very much that internationalism is important, but the current international trade rules favour narrow business interests and not the poor and the environment. Changing those rules is the priority for Doha, not launching a new round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Persisting with the Doha meeting and making it a success are, therefore, of considerable political importance. Of course, we cannot at this stage hope for the sea change that is required, but adapting, improving and consolidating the WTO system would at least be a good start. As supporters of the multilateral approach, we must fulfil this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The criminals who destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center know the value of symbols. Making trade the focus of coexistence with other countries is a deeply reductive approach and directing world trade centrally is unacceptable. Multilateralism must be neither asymmetrical nor imperialist. Doha will not be Seattle, however. Civil movements have helped to make their leaders think, the southern countries are, with the welcome support of the Commission, playing an increasingly important role and the time when Carla Hills wanted to use a crowbar to open up other countries’ markets to her own will will soon be a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Doha is not a sign of a new wave of liberalisations, but nor is it an agenda for development. It will be something vague between the two. An agenda will be negotiated there whose objectives will remain general. There has been no prior negotiation of the outcome, fortunately, and we approve of the principle of the Union’s mandate: to set a broad agenda, but more than just balancing liberalisation by means of rules, there is no getting away from the fact that we must try to resolve the contradictions between society’s choices and trade rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The social issue is symbolic. The main front on which we need to fight is finance, and a Union which allows tax havens to flourish within its borders must put its own house in order. Nobody can claim, though, that trade has nothing to do with fundamental rights. The WTO may not be the place to produce social conventions, but it certainly does have a responsibility to ensure coherence. The implementation of the Marrakech agreements and the incorporated agenda on agriculture and services will be at the centre of the forthcoming round. The legitimacy of the trade interests of the South must be recognised but the problem will lie in preventing negotiations boiling down to a process of tough haggling over their interests and our own. The concerns of northern societies as of those of the South must lead to a change in trade rules and to break their monopoly that favours one group. With this in mind, we must accept that we will have to open the door to the renegotiation of certain rules, in particular, those concerning intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, although the democratisation of the WTO will certainly not be on the agenda, it is nevertheless clear that this round will not succeed if it is nothing more than a diplomatic battle between countries, even if the European Union is happy to play the honest mediator. Civil society must be involved; we must consult our citizens and take account of their criticism and their demands. This is the only way to ensure that democracy will penetrate the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Abitbol (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, on the eve of this new meeting of the World Trade Organisation, which I prefer to call the Trading the World Organisation, you have used the correct term: legitimacy. The failure of Seattle, which I predicted, several weeks beforehand and in writing – forgive me if I gloat – was entirely due, in my opinion, to this twofold lack of legitimacy. Firstly, because the WTO itself has no legitimacy and, whatever people may think, is not up to the task that it has set itself. I am talking more precisely, however, about the absence of legitimacy of the European Union and I must say that this is not meant as personal criticism or criticism of the quality of the very idea of having a single negotiator, even if it does have a mandate, to replace all of our old nations, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, which have, since the early middle ages, expanded on the mould of this international trade, which is now global. No one can picture you, whatever your qualities, which everyone recognises, promoting both the interests of all of these countries and maintaining the diplomatic channels that the history of our ancient nations could allow us to fulfil, either with Latin America for Spain, Africa for France, etc. There is, as always, a huge pretentiousness or even vanity, on the part of the European Union, in seeking to replace, in one fell swoop, a thousand years of history and in claiming to be able to fulfil this role.</p>
<p class="contents">The second stumbling block, of course, is the hypocrisy of the World Trade Organisation, which is approaching these negotiations like a wolf approaches a lamb. Since the financial world effectively took control of the economy twenty years ago, international trade is now mainly an excuse to continually, ceaselessly and forever and beyond expand the sphere of financial speculation to the point that these negotiations are beginning to look like a big raffle held for the benefit of those organising the raffle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, international trade is in crisis: according to the forecasts of the <span class="italic">Istituto affari internationali</span>, 2001 will see growth of 2% compared to the 13% in 2000. I feel it is right to raise the issues of WTO reforms, legitimacy and transparency of decisions so that we do not lose sight of the WTO’s primary, unique mission which is to extend international trade. This is why Doha must not fail: it must not fail because it has to ensure the sustained expansion of international trade over the next few years. The responsibility of the success or failure of Doha lies with Europe and the other more advanced countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I feel that we must take note of certain considerations and questions. Firstly, in my opinion, we must stop following the line of reciprocity at all costs. Removing the barriers to trade – even unilaterally – is not an act of surrender. It is a farsighted measure, particularly in economic terms. I commend Commissioner Lamy for taking this approach with the Everything but Arms initiative, although we will have to explain to the European citizens that, under that initiative, which was well-received and rightly so, banana duties will fall definitively in 2009, that is in 10 years time – a geologically important period in many respects – and we will also have to tell them why.</p>
<p class="contents">A further problem we must avoid is overloading Doha with an oversized agenda. I would stress that Doha has a specific mission. We must not overload Doha and the WTO by attempting to use them to put right a number of issues which we feel need to be rectified in the world today. Certain positions expressed on the environment, health and employment standards do nothing to defend us against accusations that the advanced countries and Europe are actually using the extension of the agenda for protectionist ends. The developing countries are in a strong position and are not so very far from the truth when they say that all these so very politically correct issues actually serve to slow down the opening up of our markets to goods which have to come, first and foremost, from the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agriculture, I feel that we must bring to an end this game of hide-and-seek, this game of role plays between Europe and the United States in which, while we are waiting for someone to make the first move and start to reduce agricultural protection, we are all maintaining duty levels and levels of agricultural subsidies which are incompatible with the liberalisation of trade in the agricultural sector, when, as has been pointed out, this is one of the sectors which could most be most beneficial to the developing countries. In Europe, we grant a subsidy of a dollar a day per bovine animal – and these animals are not high quality, they are our own mad cows – when there are one billion, three hundred thousand human beings who have to live on less than one dollar a day.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have it: if we genuinely want the WTO and Doha to be successful, these are the issues we must address. We must be bold and, I would stress, abandon the principle of ‘reciprocity at all costs’. Unilateral measures opening up international trade benefit, first and foremost, those who have the courage to implement them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to ask you Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether you can support this position when you are assembling your papers for the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference and, firstly, for the Convention for which we are all striving? It is there that the breakthrough should at last occur, so that the European Parliament can draw even in institutional terms with the American Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few years, the WTO will, through the imminent accession of China and Taiwan – both of which have long been important trading partners of Europe – and the eventual accession of Russia, gain a global dimension, giving it an even greater worldwide representative role and presenting it with new challenges. To achieve this, it will have to adapt its structures and change the way it works. With Qatar, there is the additional factor that we must make a start and genuinely involve all the developing countries, not only the representatives of the least developed, in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The technical aid which the EU and the other industrialised countries are called upon to provide is crucial for these countries' future real involvement in the decision-making process. The WTO must, however, also increase its efficiency despite these changes and become more transparent and more readily understood by the world's citizens. How will the WTO harmonise its new, strengthened universality with the need to become even more efficient and make markets more open? Our resolution attempts to reconcile these two requirements, although surely incompletely as yet. We Europeans must contribute our environmental legislation, our regulations on food safety, our multifunctional agriculture and our social security legislation as expressions of a tangible European reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, some weeks after 11 September, it is particularly important, partly as a response to terrorism, that we, the EU and, particularly, the European Parliament, continue without distraction on our way towards greater openness and democracy in the WTO and resolutely set about the necessary reforms. We need to promote fair and freer world trade rather than seal ourselves off by means of protectionism and fall back upon national markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also strive to realise soon the central proposition of the European Parliament – the establishment of an effective parliamentary assembly for the WTO, to be the world's mouthpiece in trading matters. We therefore need representatives of the American Congress in Doha as well. We are relying on the parliaments of the industrialised states, of the emergent countries and of all the developing countries. May we ask, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if you, at the end of your presidency of the Council, could give your support to this proposal, which we must implement as soon as possible?</p>
<p class="contents">We support Commissioner Lamy's efforts at using our cooperative structures to involve Africa in particular – Africa, that continent which is largely forgotten by world trade – more intensively in dialogue on the subject of a parliamentary assembly. Our seminar on 12 April was the first example of a successful conference on trade, democracy and development to involve our friends from Africa alongside the representatives of the industrialised countries in America, Europe and Asia. Technical support from the Commission and our parliamentary budget played an important part in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, political practice is developing in such a way that we can only confront global threats in a global fashion: all united. Furthermore, we also know that poverty and underdevelopment are significant causes of insecurity. A Japanese thinker, Daisako Ikeda, said that the new concept of security, which focuses on the security of States, must be defined differently, focusing on the well-being of peoples. Only by extending freedom, human rights and development can we recover our security.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, these events have speeded up the decline in confidence in our security and the economy, areas which were already showing signs of weakness. It is therefore now important that we send clear signs of revitalisation and attention to the concerns of our citizens and, above all, to the concerns of the countries which need it most, that is, the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It must therefore be an absolute priority to launch this new round of multilateral negotiations in Qatar on the date set, not yet to negotiate, but at least to set the agenda in the direction we wish to take. We want to move towards a result which provides a balance between opening up trade and subjecting that trade to rules, internal democratic, and external democratic, rules, which respect fundamental social standards, the environment and the security of our consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want a balance between an increase in exchanges and special attention to the concerns of our citizens, as well as the concerns and needs of the developing countries, who must be allowed to share fully in the benefits of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, therefore, the mandate which the Council has given to the Commission, in our opinion, corresponds to these balances and deserves our full support. I would like to thank Commissioner Lamy for the sensitivity he has always shown towards the European Parliament and his constant cooperation. In return, Parliament and the parliamentary delegation which will accompany him to Qatar will offer him all their support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On which side does the EU really stand in the global North-South conflict? Things are looking quite bad. In spite of the stream of protests from, for example, India and Malaysia, the least developed countries, the G77 group, China and a host of environmental and solidarity movements, the EU intends, together with the United States, to try to play its trump card by making the WTO’s free trade doctrine apply not only to traditional trade but to practically the whole of economic life. According to what Commissioner Lamy said in a statement earlier today, the EU’s main objective is to open the markets of the developing countries to EU companies. When it comes to TRIPS and GATS, too, it is obvious that the EU is on a collision course with the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this global struggle, which is more crucial than the fight against terrorism, a number of ‘progressive’ people have believed that the EU could constitute a tool actually to combat neo-liberal globalisation. If the EU does not change its tactics, there is everything to indicate, however, that, when it comes to the crunch, the WTO meeting in Doha will be proof that all the fine declarations of solidarity are being abandoned. It is then that a ‘policy of naked interest’ appears, that is to say, a policy that places the EU alongside the United States and against the majority of the world’s poorer countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems, however, that well-intentioned appeals are not going to prevent it from going down this path. It is simply the case that trade in goods and money transactions are governed by the law of the market. The market is, by its very nature, immoral. Those who want to maintain their hold on the market have to make a profit or else they go under.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO has obviously set itself the goal of cutting the market off from the demands of society at large and even from parliaments. The opinions now on the table at least show an awareness of the problem. It is right to take small steps. However, far more ambitious steps must follow. We cannot wash the coat of the bear which the WTO has become without getting the animal itself wet.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim must be to work towards a new global economic order which distributes the wealth of this earth differently, justly and fairly, overcomes poverty, establishes and guarantees broad-based democratic cooperation giving parliaments a voice, and makes independent economic development possible for all countries. The European Parliament should do everything within its power to challenge the Council and the Commission to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Kofi Annan recently said that the Doha Summit must be the development summit. If this is to be the case, it is essential that the developing countries can be fully integrated into the structures of the WTO and they must be given easier access to world trade. That is why I want to insist on the importance of the technical measures for developing countries, because it is these measures which will allow these countries to take full advantage of the commercial opportunities offered by the liberalisation of the markets. Repealing or renegotiating the agreements already adopted is not the solution. On the contrary, in Doha the European Union must remind all the member countries of the WTO that it is necessary to respect the commitments made in the existing agreements, just as the European Union has respected its commitments. I am thinking specifically of the textile industry, which has strictly respected its commitment to open up its market, increasing quotas and progressively increasing the application of the GATT rules in the sector, which is something that not all countries have done, including the most developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that trade, even if it is multilateral, will not in itself resolve the inequalities of our planet, but it may reduce them by reconciling the interests and concerns of all the parties involved, especially those of the weakest. The European Union has proven experience in this task and we hope that after Doha, by following the line we have taken until now, Commissioner, we can finally succeed in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Open trade – yes, but only with rules. Our national and European interests, yes of course, but also the interests of the developing world – your approach, Commissioner, and ours.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to concentrate on two frankly difficult areas – TRIPS and the environmental aspects of trade which you have already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, TRIPS: what we now have in the agreement is not clear enough or good enough. Intellectual property rights are important in world trade, but we thought that the 25.5 million HIV positive people in sub-Saharan Africa could have access to cheap drugs under TRIPS. Let us ensure that this is made more explicit after Doha. Ironically, the United States, the world's most fierce defender of intellectual property rights is now faced with the dilemma of needing huge supplies of antibiotics to combat anthrax. Attitudes may change with new circumstances – in any case, they have to.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, environmental standards. The EU faces charges of protectionism. Commissioner, you know that this is not the case, that we are ready to help developing countries in any way necessary as we are helping applicant countries, that we have science on our side and that we will not abandon our hard-won progress – why should we? Multilateral environment agreements cannot be discarded in the name of free trade and the precautionary principle must be explicitly included in WTO rules. This is a deal-breaker for us. We in the EU know more than any other part of the world how untrammelled free trade can be controlled through multilateral rule-making to the benefit of our citizens. Our achievements in the EU are relevant elsewhere, and we should defend them – your task Commissioner. I know you will be tough on our behalf. I hope you will be tough too on core labour standards. Seattle did not work – Doha can if it is fair and if there is a balance of trade and justice.</p>

Firstly, I should like to compliment Commissioner Lamy most particularly on the superb cooperation which we are enjoying and – I think that I speak for everyone – on the excellent manner in which he is representing the European Union in the run-up to this forthcoming trade round.</p>
<p class="contents">His task will certainly be a difficult one. The right balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, representing European interests and, on the other, ensuring that the other countries, our negotiating partners, and in particular the developing countries, are brought on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I believe that this round will, more than any other, be able to send out a message to the world that it is possible to reconcile trade and politics. I trust, Commissioner Lamy, that you are in a position to achieve this, working together with your colleague Bob Zoelleck, but also with the many other negotiating partners that you have. It will not be an easy task. However, everything bodes well. I am grateful to you for consistently encouraging Parliament to play a more significant role in trade policy. Regrettably the Council has not taken the same step. Like you, I hope that we will be able to achieve more in this respect in the future. Incidentally, I should also like to thank all those colleagues in this House who have always supported this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, moreover, like to remind you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you also have a task to carry out in Doha, namely organising the meeting with all of the trade ministers. We have a good tradition of arranging for the European Parliament's delegation to meet the ministers attending the trade round. I would earnestly request that you organise this meeting again this time and also ensure that we have a debate and that it is not just an occasion for a chat or seen as a bit of an afterthought, as the Council is wont to do, but that it really is an occasion for serious dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should also like to inform you very briefly – my colleague, Konrad Schwaiger, mentioned this – that the parliaments will also have a joint meeting in Doha. The invitation will be extended jointly by the President of this House and the President of the IPU. I hope that we will make progress there.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neyts-Uyttebroeck,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to extend a warm thanks to all those who have taken the floor in this debate, for the good wishes they have conveyed to Commissioner Lamy and hopefully the Council presidency too, and I hope that we indeed manage to organise a balanced trade round with a broad-based agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">My only comment in this respect is that I very much appreciate the fact that you have valued our respective efforts to improve the atmosphere prior to the start of such a round, and that you, as it were, assisted us in those efforts. This is a tremendous boost a fortnight prior to the start of this Fourth Ministerial Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">If you allow me, Mr President, I should like to respond briefly to the specific questions that have been raised, notably those by Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann about the role of parliaments and Members of Parliament. Mr Schwaiger, I can only respond on behalf of my government with regard to our position concerning an amendment to Article 133 of the Treaty. I can only say to him that it was not the Belgian government that has precluded an amendment to the article. We will continue to strive towards a broadening of the Commission’s negotiation authority under that article, and towards greater parliamentary involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I can say to Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann that I am delighted with the initiative for a parliamentary meeting in Doha; that appears to me to be extremely important. I will therefore be very happy to lend my support to this effort, and I hope that it will be possible to inject a little more stability into the meeting, because I believe it to be absolutely of fundamental importance for Members of Parliament – for in addition to MEPs, the meeting will, of course, also be attended by a number of national MPs – to learn to listen to each other. Maybe it will then be a little easier for us, members of the government, to convince our national parliaments of the accuracy of some of our claims when they hear those expressed by their colleagues from other countries, and particularly from developing countries. I welcome this development with open arms. It is significant in itself. It will also contribute towards more transparency in the activities of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This does bring me to one minor remark made by Mrs Lucas who believes that the World Trade Organisation should be reformed first, before negotiations can commence. I should like to say to her that I cannot see how any changes could be made to the way the organisation works without a negotiation round. I should like to draw her attention to the fact that the very careful preparation of the Doha conference in itself bears witness to an entirely different approach from before. Finally, I should like to remind her that the World Trade Organisation is, in fact, a very young organisation which is very much open to improvement, and we will happily take part in this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I gladly promise Mrs Mann, I will be organising a meeting with the Members of Parliament in Doha. Mrs Mann, you know very well that you and Mr Westendorp, as well as a few other MEPs, have had the opportunity to exchange ideas with us immediately prior to the start of the informal External Trade Council, so we will naturally carry on with this tradition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I too wish to thank the speakers who have stated their support for the Commission’s position – including the President-in-Office of the Council – and also to thank those who have wished the negotiators good luck. Custom dictates that I should answer those who expressed more critical views and who, in tomorrow’s vote will not be adopting the position that the majority groups have stated they will. I shall do so briefly, replying first to Caroline Lucas – speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – the reasoning in whose speech I consider to contain a slight contradiction. On the one hand, Mrs Lucas, your group is in favour of tougher rules governing trade – specifically from the point of view of considering the environment – and yet, on the other, it is not in favour of negotiations taking place. You must have some solution for changing international rules that does not involve negotiating. Please tell me about it, because I have no such solution.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Herzog, whose group I understand intends to adopt a similar position, I would like to say that I particularly liked your expression ‘tough haggling’. There will indeed be some of that. It is true that the WTO sometimes seems a little bit like a grocer’s shop but we must also remember that the more progress globalisation makes, the more trade develops and, occasionally, the more our values are at stake. In these cases, I think that toughness becomes a duty, whatever resentment this may engender.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Abitbol spoke on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. You lament the fact, Mr Abitbol, that the Union has a single negotiator. I would remind you that this issue was decided for the future of the European Union 44 years ago. You choose to see in this the vanity of our founding fathers. Fifty years on, all I can see is their foresight.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Abitbol, on the point you made, as on other critical points that were made, I would simply remind you that although the Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union, it does so under the control of those who gave it its mandate, which are the Council of Ministers and Parliament. Both will be attending the meeting: the Council, representing the States and Parliament’s delegation, with which you are familiar. In all honesty, I really cannot envisage a more effective method of ensuring that the negotiator’s political responsibility is maintained throughout. It is up to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to oversee this process of giving account but, ultimately, I shall return with a position that I have negotiated and it will be up to the Council and Parliament to state their position with regard to the Treaties. This is how our democracy works. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
