<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, it was with a great deal of pleasure that I listened to the previous debates on projects very close to my heart, projects that I helped to move forward and to develop during the period in which I was responsible for culture. I am, moreover, very happy to continue to take an active part in the area of culture by taking charge, more specifically, of the audiovisual sector. In actual fact, the audiovisual sector fully participates in the programmes on cultural diversity, with cultural diversity being Europeans’ greatest asset. On this subject, rest assured that I was delighted, as were all the Members of the European Parliament, that Unesco adopted the universal declaration on cultural diversity. It should be known that it took a long fight to obtain this outcome. Moreover, it is the sign, as one Member said in the previous debate, that, if Europe has a sound unifying project, founded on a vision that gathers the world around Europe, and that if Europe speaks with a single voice, it can triumph. I believe that this needs to be a lesson for us all: no, cultural diversity is not exclusively European; it is a global phenomenon, and we are right to invest in our European cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is along these lines, of course, that the MEDIA programme plays a dominant role. The MEDIA programme helps our cultural, and cinematographic, diversity to exist. Firstly, it helps future film-makers to find their way and to choose their vocational training. Then, during the period in which the film goes from being just a dream to becoming a screenplay – a period that is fraught with difficulties, in which no one yet believes in the project – it is Europe that helps the film-makers to find the financial resources they require. Then, at the production stage, full responsibility for supporting the production of the film is handed back to the Member States, which support their national film industries by means of the State aid that we, as the Commission, authorise. At the same time, we make the private sector aware of its responsibility to invest in the creative film industries. Finally, when the film is complete, Europe takes over once again because the film still needs to be distributed, not only in the country in which it was made, but also beyond the borders of that country. Cultural diversity, in actual fact, means that a film should be seen, and not only in the country in which it was made and in the language of that country, but also by the rest of Europe. What better way of understanding our neighbours’ cultures than of understanding them by means of a film?</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud to say that nine-tenths of European films exported for screening in another country are exported with the help of the MEDIA programme. I can also tell you just how proud the networks of film-makers, cinemas, film creators and film festivals are. All of these networks are doing, in actual fact, what Europe does best: uniting and joining forces to give expression to our cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is very important that we continue along this path because, even if we help our film industry and even if we are proud of our film-makers, European films are, and remain, in the minority on their own soil. It is therefore crucial that we continue, even more so than in the past, to make cinema more diverse and to distribute films. That is why the MEDIA programme, which was presented in July 2004, has been provided with a budget of over EUR 1 billion. The Commission recognises, in fact, the importance of this programme for the future of our creative output and of our audiovisual heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope with all of my heart, like all of you do, that the debates on finance in Europe will enable this investment in our film industry to materialise and that the budget will not be cut back. I know that you are anxious for this to be the outcome, and I would also like to thank the Committee on Culture and Education, as well as its rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, for the magnificent job they have both done. I would like to thank all of the other committees - the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – which have, themselves, also studied the problem. They were right to do so because our films amount to a great deal more than culture: they involve trade, international relations and industry. Therefore, all MEPs, irrespective of their committee, need to take an interest in this cultural diversity, brought about by our cultural industries thanks to the talent of our film-makers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments, I would like to say to you that, as a general rule, I can accept almost all of them. There are 77 amendments. The Commission will accept 56 of them because, quite simply, Parliament has done some very positive, creative and constructive work, and I would like to thank it for having done this work, which markedly improves the project the Commission has put on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the amendments in more detail, I would like to say to you that I particularly welcome the amendments that enhance the importance of the new priorities given to MEDIA 2007 compared with the previous MEDIA programme. On the one hand, it is a matter of funding small and medium-sized enterprises, which are fragile and need our help and, on the other, of using digital technology. Digital technology is making great strides all around us, but it is still not perfect. We must help to improve digitisation. Those two points are crucial for strengthening the competitiveness of the sector. Furthermore, we also need to make sure that European films take advantage of the new prospects offered by digital technology such as, for example, the legal downloading of films from the Internet. Parliament knows that I am encouraging the directors of businesses in the telecommunications and Internet sector and content creators to sit down together around a table in order to resolve, among themselves, the problem of piracy and to distribute the revenues between the two branches of the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments that the Commission cannot accept – a very small minority of amendments, Mrs Hieronymi – I would like to explain why this is the case. This explanation will enable you to understand that we are not opposing one particular amendment or another. Rather, it is in consideration of their appropriateness, or otherwise, that we are not accepting them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three groups of amendments. The first concerns the amendments introducing actions and objectives that do not come under the MEDIA programme. For example, as commendable as the amendment concerned may be, the MEDIA programme is not designed to meet the needs of disabled citizens, which would require, for example, cinemas in certain Member States to be adapted. We simply do not have the resources to invest in this area. However, it is, of course, a policy that we support in moral terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The second group of amendments concerns actions and objectives that are already covered by the programme. There is therefore no need to repeat them. For example, there is no point in adding a priority that is already one of the actual headings for action under the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group of amendments concerns one of the priorities of the programme – an absolute priority, in my view – and that is the need to reduce the imbalances, within the audiovisual market, between countries with a high audiovisual production capacity and those with a small geographical and linguistic area. That is a crucial priority for the MEDIA programme. However, the proposed amendments would have the effect – unintended, I am sure – of limiting the actions that have been proposed by the Commission in favour of the new Member States. They would not strengthen co-productions either, which, for me, like, I believe, for you, are one of the crucial factors for improving collaboration beyond borders. Therefore, if I reject certain amendments, it is to prevent them from hindering some of the core priorities of the new text.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to criticise two other amendments: one on the Constitutional Treaty and one on opening up the programme to third countries. With regard to the Constitutional Treaty, the Commission’s position is not to accept references of this kind as long as the Treaty has not been ratified. As for the second amendment, it is desirable to follow the approach that has already been established and to consider such cooperation in the appropriate context, namely that of adhering to the conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, Mr President, Mrs Hieronymi, I would like to say that, in light of the very great majority, indeed of almost all, of the amendments proposed by Parliament, the Commission will be amending its proposal. I thank you once again for the work that Parliament has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ruth Hieronymi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, MEDIA 2007 represents the third generation of the MEDIA programme of support for the European film industry, which has a great and twofold objective, in that we want to help promote European culture across all borders, while at the same time promoting the creation of jobs with a significant future in the audiovisual sector. MEDIA 2007 is a joint effort, and so I very warmly thank the Commission – and you, Commissioner Reding, in particular – for the excellent cooperation, and your staff as well. I also wish to thank the Luxembourg and British Presidencies for their good cooperation and particularly, of course, the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and all the committees that advised us.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing to be said about MEDIA 2007 is that the programme is as urgently needed as ever it was, for European films are still outnumbered in Europe, with an average of 70% of the films shown in our cinemas still being of American origin. There are three essential reasons why this is so; the first is that cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe, while being our great asset, also makes for highly fragmented audiovisual markets, which – and this is the second reason – are largely characterised by small and medium-sized enterprises, which – thirdly – suffer from chronic under-capitalisation. All these considerations means that the MEDIA programme will be urgently needed over the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is evident that MEDIA is a highly successful programme, in that nine out of ten films shown outside their country of origin were supported by it. What now remains to be done is to increase European cinema’s overall market share, and that is why this third programme is to have the same priorities as before: training, development, distribution and promotion. Production itself remains a matter for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What changes does the programme propose to make? One is a substantial increase in funding. Let me say that I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner for having, from the very outset, been firm in demanding an increase to EUR 1.055 billion. You can be sure – as can the Council – that this House as a whole will not be prepared to go below that amount, which represents the minimum that is needed for the audiovisual sector over the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, what else has changed? In every area, digitalisation is a priority; it is the technology of the future, which must, over the coming years, be made use of and developed. Secondly, there is a need for more cooperation at every level. Among other things, the European Union’s participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory will be of value, as will closer cooperation with Eurimages, but there is also a need for the networks to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying something about the amendments that remain to be considered, particularly the amendments on the protection of juveniles tabled by the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group. Protection of the young is something of which we are all in favour, but it is not something that the film programme primarily exists to do; there are other programmes to do that, and so, on this point, we cannot agree to what you ask.</p>
<p class="contents">My warmest thanks, though, to the House as a whole; we have shared in putting this programme together, and that is the best foundation for its future success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the creative ability of its citizens, of the people who live in Europe – its dreams, as Mrs Reding was saying – that create Europe’s strength, including its cultural strength. Its audiovisual industry can be a perfect example of that, not only in terms of protecting Europe in this era of large-scale global homogenisation, but also in terms of reinforcing the sense of a collective identity composed of so very many different identities, which create cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and my group, in particular, have been totally in favour of this Media 2007 programme from the outset. The programme contributes to shaping these undefined elements of European citizenship. It is therefore crucial to support the text as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, that it will be a matter of reflecting upon some of the amendments that you do not want. I imagine that there will be an opportunity to discuss them. Be that as it may, I am delighted to see that you are satisfied by the amendments that somewhat improve the text. I have the feeling that, in the course of this part-session, we will be voting in favour of a very fine text, which will enhance this European cultural dimension of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the brief round-up today of the new results of the MEDIA and ΜEDIA Plus programmes gives good cause to hope, Commissioner, that the MEDIA 2007 programme will help to further stabilise competition between European and foreign audiovisual producers and that it will result in the multiple application of each of the EUR 1 055 million in investments, education and development works.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, on the proposed improvements to the proposed programme. It gives cause to hope that, by strengthening new technologies and promoting the competitiveness of the European cinema industry, European diversity and the maintenance and dissemination of the cinematic cultural heritage will be supported and opportunities will be given for new quality works which will promote the European idea, human values, human dignity, mutual respect, equality between men and women and the protection of childhood and youth.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, investments under the programme in the stage before and after production will help to overcome the weaknesses of small national markets, in order to maintain and strengthen the cultural wealth in small countries such as my homeland. However, as the rapporteur notes, this cannot be achieved with national companies alone and needs non-national European companies; they just need to be given access to specialist credit institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope, Commissioner, that under your inspired guidance, the ratio of European to foreign audiovisual productions will be at least 50/50 by 2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The programme reuses the structure and the mechanisms of the current programmes, which have proved to have had a very positive impact on the audiovisual sector. The overall objectives of the future programme have been successfully adapted to the structure of businesses in the sector and to their funding requirements as well as to the development of technology and of the market in a very competitive environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore simply highlight the fact that, with a funding package that represents 15% of the sum dedicated to promoting culture and European citizenship in the financial perspectives, the audiovisual sector and thus cultural diversity will be enhanced in a way that is advantageous.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, by pointing out that this sector is not only of great political and cultural importance, but that it also has great social and economic potential, the Commission is proposing to allocate to Media 2007 a budget of EUR 1.055 billion over the period 2007-2013 to fund its actions and administrative costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The future Media 2007 programme would thus see the current budget for the MEDIA Plus and MEDIA Training programmes increase by more than 50%. It is the first post-enlargement programme, and the increase in the budget should enable effective support to be provided to professionals in the new Member States, who still often have reduced investment capacities and reduced access to bank lending.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal, the Commission also recommends simplifying Community intervention with regard to administrative and financial procedures. Taking into account the entire set of proposals designed to improve a programme that has already proved its worth, Media 2007 deserves to be positively received, even if the package of EUR 1.055 billion is only an indicative amount for the moment, until such time as the financial perspectives are adopted. In view of the important funding requirements of a sector that, while fast expanding, is fragmented into numerous SMEs in the 27 countries concerned, it is clear that these financial perspectives are eagerly awaited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets therefore supports this new programme, which takes account of enlargement and of the difficulties SMEs have in accessing Community actions and funding. Improving this programme, which aims to put in place more flexible procedures thanks to the proportionality of requirements for recipient businesses, is also a crucial point. Thus, Media 2007 should enable the film industry and the European audiovisual sector to continue to develop their activities by rising to the challenges of global competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore get on to the main point.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain the lever effect that the MEDIA programme is acknowledged as having today in a more intensely competitive market, it is imperative that we continue to make sure that the programme is adaptable, that we continue to meet the expectations of professionals and, furthermore, that we continue to rise to the challenges represented by the arrival and the prodigious development of new formats, such as digital technology, or of new supports, such as mobile telephones.</p>
<p class="contents">To be still more effective, MEDIA should not therefore just be following technological developments, but anticipating them, if not encouraging them. Thus, complementarity between MEDIA and other related programmes in the area of innovation and research is crucial and still needs to be enhanced. MEDIA 2007 is the first post-enlargement programme. Safeguarding the film productions of the new Member States on its own justifies an increase in European support, with care being taken, in particular, to establish proportionality in favour of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to support the indirect costs linked to the private funding of production projects. Such action would enable a large number of businesses to have increased access to bank loans, as the risks would be reduced. This access to bank loans by SMEs is a crucial factor in the development of a strong audiovisual industry. In this geopolitical and technological context, the budget of EUR 1.055 billion, as proposed by the Commission, is the minimum threshold for seven years and 27 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the initiatives taken on this matter for encouraging and facilitating national investments, which have become crucial to the success of MEDIA’s forthcoming objectives, I cannot agree to MEDIA being subjected to our whims when we debate the financial perspectives. Those are the conditions that will mean that MEDIA, which has a crucial bearing on the Lisbon objectives being met, can enable one of the most promising sectors in terms of job creation and economic growth to be developed and enhanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our Committee on Culture and Education considers it important to put digitisation and European catalogues at the centre of the ‘Media 2007’ programme. We see this as the key to surmounting the fragmentation of the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas a large part of the programme is like giving a fish to a starving person, digitisation is equivalent to teaching a person to fish. The European Commission should become actively involved in finding the most suitable digitisation platform and in establishing standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The addition of subtitles is closely linked to digitisation. Digital media make it possible to select a combination of languages and subtitles as necessary. The favouring of subtitles over dubbing promotes language learning, literacy and improved understanding between cultures. For people with hearing disabilities, however, the presence of subtitles is of the utmost importance. I sincerely regret that the programme does not devote sufficient attention to the needs of disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">As a representative of a small country, I am also glad that the quota system and other measures will support content producers from the smallest and poorest linguistic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Estonian market is so small that international distribution is the only way to recoup the cost of the production of films. Some of our cartoon producers have achieved international recognition without using any text in their work. This is a case of resourcefulness by necessity, which has now become a distinctive tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">For small producers, it is important that digitisation should significantly reduce distribution costs. Also, using subtitles instead of hiring actors offers a real opportunity to cut costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be very glad if ‘Media 2007’ led to better utilisation of underused studios and other film-making resources. I would like to see the European Union play a more active role in the organisation of film distribution. The idea is that Europe should regain its position from American cinema.</p>

<p class="contents">Our audiovisual heritage is without doubt a valuable channel for consolidating our common historical identity and for understanding our diverse cultures, which form the basis for developing European citizenship. It is no accident that films are already recognised in law as a cultural asset in some countries. I endorse the rapporteur’s proposal in Amendment 71 to establish a network of databases encompassing the European audiovisual heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, Commissioner, I must point out that, during the debate in this Chamber on the Hegyi report on the preservation of our film heritage on 9 May 2005, I proposed setting up a European themed film archive to preserve a careful selection of films about historical events and episodes relating to the development of the Community project.</p>
<p class="contents">Another sensitive issue is funding: we have to remedy the chronic undercapitalisation of the sector by providing better access to credit facilities for the audiovisual industry and enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from special financial services. I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s Amendments 10 and 59. Of course, in the EU’s current situation, I regard the proposal to commit financial resources amounting to EUR 1 005 million over the 2007-2013 period as the absolute minimum needed to achieve the programme’s goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, it is important to encourage the development of new talent; that is why I shall vote for the rapporteur’s Amendment 56, which proposes establishing a scholarship named after Pier Paolo Pasolini for young talent.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the use of new technologies, as also suggested by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy I propose that the Commission should take charge of evaluating pilot projects that have been carried out and of disseminating them if they prove to be successful experiments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that European films have difficulty holding their own against their American competitors. Irrespective of whether we regard this fact as a problem or as something we have to accept, the question we should ask ourselves is the following: ought the EU to deal with political issues of this type or do such issues fall within the Member States’ area of responsibility? The June List’s answer is clear: this is an issue for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States wish to invest resources of their own in promoting their national film industries, they of course have every right to do so. The EU should not, however, implement special programmes to benefit the European film industry. If a number of EU countries think it necessary to cooperate within this policy area, they can, moreover, do so without EU interference.</p>
<p class="contents">Intergovernmental agreements or cooperation between film companies can take place outside the framework of the EU. Amendment 15 refers to the EU Constitution which, it stresses, emphasises the value of respecting cultural and linguistic diversity. However, that is no legitimate reason for supporting EU programmes like this. Members of this Chamber must accept that the populations of France and the Netherlands voted against the EU Constitution, which has thus been rejected and is no longer a relevant source of reference.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture and Education wishes to invest more than EUR 1 billion in this programme. The EU does not need further questionable and expensive projects. It should instead aim for limited cooperation on significant and genuinely cross-border issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such low value cultural products do most damage to the new countries of the European Union, some of which are small. I might include my own country Lithuania. Such products not only destroy cultural consciousness, but also create the demand for a low value culture, which requires no intellectual effort.

<p class="contents">The European audiovisual sector is highly fragmented. European cinema productions are being made within the framework of one state, resulting of course in a cultural and linguistic diversity in cinema productions. Nonetheless, the immense wealth in terms of the linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe is, at the same time, the cause of the greatest structural problem on the audiovisual markets in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because of this situation and numerous other reasons that transatlantic productions, as everyone has said, have a 70% and hence a dominant position on the European market, while the balance of trade deficit of the European Union to the United States totals USD eight billion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the problem is not one of numbers. It is primarily cultural. For example, has European culture been disseminated to Asia or Africa through the cinema over the last 20 years? Of course not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The audiovisual industry is one of the most rapidly growing sectors in Europe. In the EU over one billion people went to the cinema in 2004, yet American films dominate the industry, holding 71% of the market. So far the European Union has failed to make effective use of its own audiovisual market. This ultimately means lost opportunities for growth and employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has tremendous linguistic and cultural diversity and this must be capitalised on through the audiovisual sector. I have seen the importance of this sector at first hand in my own region in the west of Ireland, where the Irish language is spoken. It has gone from strength to strength in recent years. People go to the cinema more often in Ireland than in any other EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of a vibrant European-based audiovisual industry cannot be over-emphasised. It is a channel providing important opportunities for communicating the key values underlying Europe’s rich cultural heritage and it must therefore be supported in every possible way.</p>

It is true that European cinema has several dimensions to it. It has an economic dimension. It is undoubtedly one of the cultural industries that makes a positive contribution to the important issue of industrial competitiveness featured in the Lisbon Strategy. However, it is not only a commercial industry, it is also a cultural industry, as it is enriched by cultural diversity. What we are talking about are the stories of Europeans, which must be told by Europeans; the dreams of Europeans, which must be put on film by Europeans; and cultural diversity in its entirety, which must find its way onto our cinema screens. That is why the Commission truly is keen to invest in cultural diversity and to help this diversity to function.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat here the comments made by Members, because I almost entirely agree with them. I would, however, like to come back to two points, which I did not mention in my introduction. Firstly, I agree with all those who said that digital technology is of the utmost importance: digital technology is an opportunity for diversity because, once the technology is installed, it will enable films to be distributed much more easily and at a lower cost. Secondly, it will be much easier to choose between languages than with today’s analogue system. Digital technology therefore represents, in my opinion, an opportunity for our film industries and an opportunity for us to learn about other cultures in Europe. Furthermore, that is one of the reasons why the MEDIA 2007 programme is seeking to make further progress along this path.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been very alert to the comments made with regard to protecting young people. Rest assured that protecting young people in the audiovisual sector is one of my main priorities. It also features in the special recommendations and in the Television Without Frontiers Directive, which is currently being revised. Members’ demands concerning the protection of young people against any possible forms of abuse are therefore taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been very alert to the comments made by some Members about the new Member States and about countries with a lower audiovisual production capacity or a small linguistic area. I am not only addressing you here in my role as Commissioner, but also as someone who hails from Luxembourg. Each time a film is made in the Luxemburgish language – and such films do exist – I feel proud and moved. I would like all of the small linguistic areas to be able to produce films in their own language, even if the market for these films is, it must be acknowledged, very small. Thus, there is all the more reason to help these small linguistic areas, and we are doing so in the MEDIA programme.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point which, I believe, I put forward within the Committee on Culture and Education, but which I should like to reiterate here, in plenary: my proposal for positive discrimination in favour of the new Member States, which are in need of more clearly targeted help, enabling them unquestionably to take advantage of the MEDIA programme, was unanimously agreed upon at the Council of Ministers. All of the ministers, even those who had to give up a slice of their cake in order to help the others, were in agreement. This is the Europe that we cherish. This is the Europe of solidarity, and I am pleased that the Members have further enhanced this aspect of solidarity through their amendments. We need film production to be diverse, including in those territories with a low audiovisual production capacity and a small linguistic area, because those fragments of our Europe also contribute to the European patchwork of cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">We need everyone; we need widely spoken languages and large countries, lesser spoken languages and small countries, because there is no such thing as the large, and important, and the small, and unimportant, in all of this. There are only great cultures, be they large or small, and I am proud to be able to contribute to this patchwork of diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Disadvantaged groups must be given a more significant role in the media in order to facilitate their integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The largest ethnic minority in Europe are the approximately 15 million Roma people, who form one of the most disadvantaged social groups of the Member States. At the same time, the culture of the Roma enriches and fertilises the social and cultural life of European countries and makes it more colourful.</p>
<p class="contents">The media has a prominent role in the equal opportunity society. Disadvantaged groups, including the Roma, must be given more opportunities to appear in the media, to an extent that reflects their significance; new media suitable for this purpose must be created and used, and all of this must be supported by EU financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We must encourage public media to promote understanding between cultures. The Roma minority, present in all European countries, must be effectively supported in their media appearances, in their integration process and in the preservation of their cultural values. The formulation and implementation of European and local strategies required to achieve this must support the recent steps taken to set up the Pan-European Roma TV. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
