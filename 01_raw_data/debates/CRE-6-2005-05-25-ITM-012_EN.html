<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jo Leinen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, after what we have just been discussing, which is destructive in its desire to disrupt relations between the institutions, thank heaven we are now going to deal with something constructive and something that is intended to strengthen these relations. This fourth framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament embodies a culture of cooperation in which the role of each institution is respected, whilst at the same time an effort is also made to deepen mutual understanding and cooperation. This is set down in writing in the articles of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the fourth agreement between the Commission and Parliament. I can say that each successive agreement has seen this House’s role as a ‘Chamber of Citizens’ and hence as a body monitoring the European executive progressively reinforced. This agreement, too, takes us another few steps further down this road, and so I should like to thank the Conference of Presidents and, in particular, Vice<span class="bold">–</span>President Wallström and everyone else who played a part in bringing about this framework agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention some of the key aspects of this fourth framework agreement. For a start, what we have just been debating finds a place in it; it is unequivocal in specifying the political responsibilities of the President and Members of the Commission when conflicts of interest occur. Notwithstanding the Commission’s collegial nature, each of its Members is responsible for what is done in his area of responsibility. That all 25 of the Commission’s members are individually responsible for what they do in their own sphere is a most important principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission is responsible for the steps to be taken if Commissioners are involved in conflicts of interest, and for any decisions that need to be taken. There are also clear provisions concerning the procedures to be followed when one Member leaves the Commission and is replaced by another, and indeed there were long drawn<span class="bold">–</span>out negotiations on this point. It is clear that a new Commissioner cannot take up office until he has appeared before Parliament, gone through the hearings and been given a vote of confidence by the whole House.</p>
<p class="contents">A second set of provisions relates to cooperation on lawmaking and on budgetary decisions. I see that we have managed to ensure that the Commission and Parliament will agree in advance on annual legislative programmes and multi<span class="bold">–</span>annual programming, and that the Commission will not make public any legislative or other significant initiatives before notifying Parliament. This is a crucial step in terms of Parliament’s right of codecision on key EU decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Parliament is treated as the Council’s equal in this respect. We will be kept fully informed at every stage of the legislative process, and at the same time as the Council. It has also been agreed that regular dialogue will be established at the highest level, on a three<span class="bold">–</span>monthly basis, between the Conference of Presidents and the President of the Commission or the Vice<span class="bold">–</span>President responsible for such matters, and it is my belief that this dialogue will result in greater cooperation. The Commission has also agreed to provide information on the composition and work of its expert groups, at the request of the relevant committee. Furthermore, the agreement contains several provisions concerning Parliament’s position at international conferences. The Commission undertakes to keep Parliament’s delegations fully informed of the progress of such conferences, and, wherever possible, to allow them to participate in negotiating delegations. The Commission will also provide backing for Parliament in the field of election observation, and regularly update it on the progress of accession negotiations with candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While this agreement does incorporate the Lamfalussy procedure, Parliament would have liked it to go further in this respect, as the relevant provisions apply only to securities, banking and insurance. We would have preferred it to have covered other areas as well, but it would appear that we will have to wait until the next stage of the process for this to happen. Furthermore, Members have expressed a desire for the framework agreement procedure to become more transparent in the future, and for the relevant parliamentary committees to be involved somewhat earlier in the process. All things considered, however, I would recommend this agreement to the House, since it represents real progress. As I said earlier, it symbolises a culture of cooperation that is based on mutual respect and the desire to work constructively towards the EU’s goals. After all, this is what the public and the citizens expect of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since my investiture as President of the Commission, I have been telling you of my intention to establish constructive collusion and a sustainable strategic partnership with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the early stages, we experienced some moments of institutional and political tension. An undiscerning observer might have concluded that the desire for cooperation proclaimed by myself, by Margot Wallström and by the whole Commission reflected nothing more than our intention to avoid any further friction. This interpretation has proved to be fallacious and short<span class="bold">–</span>sighted. In fact, the desire for cooperation by which we are driven results from an appreciation of the institutional reality of our Union. Under the Treaties, Parliament is the depositary of the will of the peoples of Europe; it is the only directly elected institution and the legitimate representative of the citizenry of the Member States. No other supranational organisation can rely on such an advanced degree of democracy as the European Union; no other multinational structure has assigned such an important role to the directly elected representatives of the people; no territory in the world except our continent, reunited at long last, has an institution that represents four hundred and fifty million people at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is not a remote abstract entity that takes its decisions behind closed doors, disregarding the inclinations and opinions of its peoples. On the contrary, it is based on the will of the people and on fully democratic institutions. That is the real wealth of our Union. That is what makes it unique among the existing structures in an increasingly globalised world. We are proud of this profoundly democratic character of the Union, which reflects the historical traditions of its Member States. We must act accordingly, and we intend to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is the underlying reason why we considered it opportune and necessary to revise the framework agreement, the main instrument governing relations between our institutions. This revision has taken place in a climate of excellent cooperation under the direction of the political authorities of both institutions. I wish to take this opportunity to thank President Borrell, the heads of the political groups, Mr Leinen, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and all those who have contributed to this exercise, which is such an important milestone in the history of our bilateral relations. </p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations have enabled considerable progress to be made. We have agreed on a well<span class="bold">–</span>balanced text which meets the expectations of both parties and substantially improves cooperation between our institutions. Mr Leinen has already pointed to many aspects, but I should like to outline what we consider to be the five main results.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have enhanced the political dialogue between our institutions. Together with Vice<span class="bold">–</span>President Wallström, I will on a regular basis attend the meetings of the Conference of Presidents, which will become the main forum for discussing political developments as well as the work and activities of the Parliament and the Commission. Furthermore, the timetable for the Commission’s legislative and work programme has been streamlined, and the process leading to the Commission’s legislative and work programme has become more political. In this context, Margot Wallström met the Conference of Committee Chairs in February, and will do so again in July.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have strengthened openness and transparency. The Commission commits itself to providing Parliament with a full list of the expert groups assisting us in the exercise of our right of initiative. In addition to this, the chairpersons of the relevant Parliamentary committees may ask the Commission to provide information on the activities and composition of these groups. When taken in conjunction with the existing rule on transparency relating to the ‘comitology groups’, this new provision is a very useful step. It will definitely contribute to enhancing transparency in the context of interinstitutional relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have reinforced the provisions concerning political responsibility. The framework agreement enshrines the key principles of the openness, fairness and consistency of the entire hearing process. It ensures that the Commissioners<span class="bold">–</span>designate disclose all relevant information in accordance with the duty of independence laid down in the Treaty itself. In addition, we have agreed on the procedure to be followed should Parliament express a lack of confidence in an individual Commissioner. In such cases the Commission President will give Parliament’s deliberations all the political attention they deserve. That is why we have agreed that I will either ask the individual Commissioner to resign, or I will be prepared to explain before this House the decisions I have taken. This procedure safeguards the collegiality of the Commission and the powers and prerogatives of its President. If new Commissioners are appointed during the mandate of the Commission, I will ensure, together with the President of the Parliament, that they present themselves immediately to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point concerns the improvement of our cooperation regarding the negotiation of international agreements and other aspects of our day<span class="bold">–</span>to<span class="bold">–</span>day work. We have made provision for the Commission to keep Members of Parliament systematically informed on the conduct of negotiations on multilateral agreements. We have agreed on measures for consultation of the budgetary authority on the occasion of the announcement of new financial undertakings made at international donor conferences. We have deepened our cooperation in the field of Community election observation missions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will act within the framework of the existing treaties and safeguard the competences of the other institutions, particularly the Council. While the Commission attaches great importance to our cooperation with Parliament, one should not forget that the Community method is based on a triangle. The Commission is responsible for proposing legislative and budget proposals, and the two branches of the legislative and budgetary authority are responsible for deciding on these. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is fully committed to safeguarding this method and to paying all due attention to the balance between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, Mr President, I would like to give the floor to Vice<span class="bold">–</span>President Wallström to comment on specific features of the Leinen report. I sincerely hope that this House will support the revised Framework Agreement, thus opening a new dimension to our fruitful relationship.</p>

I am very pleased by that and I hope that this House will do the same. This morning the Commission authorised President Barroso and myself to approve the text on behalf of the whole Commission after the positive vote that I hope will take place tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the speech by President Barroso, I wish to respond to a few remarks made in Mr Leinen’s report. As regards implementing powers, the Commission has already made use of its right of initiative to place the Council and Parliament on an equal footing as regards supervising comitology decisions and proceedings with regard to instruments adopted under the codecision procedure. To this effect, the Commission presented a legislative proposal in 2002, which was amended in April last year, taking into account the large majority of amendments tabled by Parliament. This is the only possible legal way to change the current situation. I wish to stress that our proposal is based on the existing Treaties and could be adopted without waiting for the entry into force of the Constitution. The Commission continues to attach considerable importance to this proposal. We are aware that Parliament supports it and we hope that the Council will give it all the attention it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, the Commission will continue to implement the current rules on comitology in full respect of the role of Parliament, as laid down in primary and secondary law and in our bilateral agreements. An internal assessment is currently taking place in the Commission to ensure effective and coherent application of these rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards providing information to Members of Parliament on the occasion of negotiations on international agreements, the solution found in the revised framework agreement is the only one possible due to the legal context.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have certainly noticed, the Commission has committed itself to keeping Members of Parliament systematically informed. Members will be appropriately informed by the Commission in full respect of their role as observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have taken note of the request made as regards ensuring proper consultation of Parliament on the integrated guidelines. The latest integrated guidelines, which will be endorsed by the European Council in June, cover a period of three years. From our point of view, this implies that in 2006 and 2007 the next integrated guidelines will have to be updated rather than drastically modified. For the next guidelines, the Commission will have to analyse not only contributions from the Member States but also data and statistics which are normally available only in December or even in January. It is a complex process. Nevertheless, in that context, the Commission will pay attention to the need to allow Parliament adequate time to deliver its position and will use its best endeavours to facilitate this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that our debate today paves the way for reinforcing constructive relations between Parliament and the Commission. As I said, the Commission stands ready to approve and sign the framework agreement. It is not just a list of wishes and formal commitments: it is a concrete and detailed instrument to regulate our relations. It will be our common responsibility to translate it into concrete facts. I am sure that our two institutions will implement it carefully and loyally.</p>
<p class="contents">I am deeply convinced that it will not be only our two institutions that will benefit from the new agreement: the Union as such will benefit from increased cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. Europe needs a strong European Parliament exercising its powers. Europe equally needs a strong, independent and credible Commission, and through your vote tomorrow you will mark an important step in this direction.</p>

<p class="contents">I believe that Mr Leinen and Vice<span class="bold">–</span>President Wallström have laid out the characteristics of this fourth Framework Agreement, and I am not therefore going to deal with the specific issues that they have explained so well. But please allow me to express a political consideration on behalf of my group. The history of this Parliament is the history of an assembly that wants more power, a consultative assembly, a Parliament elected by universal suffrage, then a Parliament with certain competences in the field of the internal market, a Parliament with codecision powers pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty and, since then, a Parliament which has been playing an increasingly significant role in legislation and political control, and that is extremely important. And I believe that, in compliance with the Treaties, this fourth Framework Agreement serves to move us forward in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, while moving in that direction, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always believed the Commission to be at the heart of the system, to be the most innovative element of the institutional architecture and that it is therefore also the most decisive element of that architecture. In the debates currently taking place, when we are asked why the European Parliament does not enjoy legislative initiative, we say ‘because it is the job of the Commission to define the Community interest, because it is the job of the Commission to ensure compliance with the Treaties’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore sure that this Framework Agreement is in line with the new European Constitution, which will provide more democracy, more efficiency and more transparency, and that it will achieve those objectives in that same way. And when we approve this Agreement tomorrow — and we will approve it tomorrow with the votes of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats — I would urge the European Commission to respond to the need to produce initiatives in Europe and to present them; if it does so, when it carries out its duties, it will always have the support of the Group that it is my honour to represent today. Thank you very much, congratulations on this work and please go ahead. It is now time to get to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, this agreement concerns us in three respects. First of all, conflicts of interest: we are waiting for it to be fully implemented with, I hope, complete transparency. Then there is comitology and, on this matter, I thank you for your comments. In the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, implementation of the Lamfalussy process is acceptable only if it operates in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement that we drew up during the previous Parliamentary term, which makes it possible to take full account of the position of the European Parliament to the same extent as the deliberations of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point relates to the implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy and the way in which this Parliament is involved in the adoption of ‘employment’ guidelines and broad economic and monetary policy guidelines. We support the idea that national parliaments must be involved upstream and must take ownership of this process, of this strategy, but this must not be to the detriment of the conditions under which the European Parliament’s position is defined. On this matter, as you know, we have a problem with the timing and I am counting on your cooperation and support so that this Parliament can be in a position to adopt its contribution to these broad guidelines under favourable conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The framework agreement is a distinct improvement on the one we signed with the Prodi Commission in 2000. It strengthens the political accountability of the Commission to Parliament, especially through the commitment of President Barroso that we see in clause 3 with respect to a loss of parliamentary confidence in an individual Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">With this revised framework agreement, the Commission itself becomes much more parliamentary in character than it has been in the past. Parliament shows itself to become far more capable and responsible for scrutinising and sustaining critically a strong executive authority. The comprehensive agreement establishes the ground rules for what promises to become a strong working relationship between us. The framework agreement certainly changes the context of Commission<span class="bold">– </span>Parliament relations from that of the previous debate on the fatuous motion of censure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group will be voting in favour of this fourth framework agreement, which it sees as strengthening dialogue and reinforcing the legitimacy of both institutions. This applies to the substance of the agreement rather than to its methodology, concerning which I should like to make a number of critical comments.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something special about interinstitutional agreements between constitutional institutions, and, in their totality – there are now several hundred of them – they take on something like a constitutional character. Agreements of such a kind can hardly be entered into by secretaries<span class="bold">–</span>general without reference to the relevant committees, without a political mandate and without the agreements being published. I believe, Mr President, that not least the group leaderships should give consideration to a change of method, and, since we want to give added force to the requirement for transparency among ourselves, we should also require the same transparency of the process whereby interinstitutional agreements come into being.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a demand – or it might be a request – to make of the Commission. Neither on our own nor on the Commission’s website is it at all possible to call up the interinstitutional agreements currently in force, for they are not published, and so none of them can be accessed or consulted. This amounts to a serious lack of transparency, and I would ask you in strong terms to make all the existing interinstitutional agreements public.</p>

It was met, of course, with a predictable grovelling response by the majority in this House. Yet this report itself accepts those same deficient procedures. The report tries to make much of Article 2 of the Framework Agreement, but the flaw therein is that while it bestows on the Commission President the obligation to identify and act upon conflicts of interests affecting Commissioners, nothing is put in place to identify and act upon such conflicts affecting the President himself. Thus the same situation which gave rise to today’s debate continues to exist unaddressed by this report. What is obviously needed is a wholly independent Commissioner for standards in public life.</p>
<p class="contents">As my second point, I take this opportunity to distance myself from the ritual obeisance to the Constitution that appears in recital A.

<p class="contents">I fully subscribe to the view set out in the Decision implementing the Agreement, namely that the deepening of democracy in the European Union calls for close relations between Parliament and the Commission and for more effective parliamentary scrutiny of the work of the executive, in other words, of the Commission. I was delighted to see that this Decision includes a reference to the European Constitution in its second citation, even though the Constitution is not yet a binding document. What is more, the Agreement’s final provisions include a revision clause that provides for the Agreement to be amended after the Constitution has entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">This is proof that both Parliament and the Commission are not only aware of the importance and significance of the European Constitution, but also realise that it needs to be put into practice as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I should like to address relates to the status of Commission experts and expert groups. Article 16 of the Agreement sets out fundamental principles relating to these expert groups, such as the need for transparency with regard to their membership and activities, and the need to update lists of names and make these lists public. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that these provisions will have some bearing on transparency in the EU, and that they will in fact ensure that the EU becomes more transparent. I also hope that they will prevent conflicts of interest and over<span class="bold">–</span>hasty accusations of corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
