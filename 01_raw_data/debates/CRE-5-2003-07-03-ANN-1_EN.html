<p>An extremely serious rail accident has recently occurred at Chinchilla (Albacete province, Castilla-La Mancha region), just a few months after a similar one occurred at Tobarra, on the same line.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the Chinchilla accident (which, as at 5 June, had left 16 dead, 10 missing and 39 injured) was due to the fact that a passenger train collided with a goods train on a single-track line which lacked any automated traffic-control devices. Just before the accident happened a hazardous substance (sulphuric acid) had been unloaded from the goods train, which prevented an exponential increase in the scale of the tragedy.</p>
<p>The general public's response to such accidents is to ask what action the European Union is taking in order to investigate and prevent such occurrences.</p>
<p>Would the Council therefore say when the European Agency for Railway Safety will come into operation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The Council would like to reiterate its deepest regret regarding the very serious rail accident in Chinchilla, Spain.</p>
<p>Whilst recalling that the adoption of measures to improve transport safety is an objective of the common transport policy, as established by the Treaty, the Council points out that the continuous improvement of rail safety on the European level is currently being addressed, by both European Parliament and Council, in the framework of the co-decision procedure for a Directive on safety on the Community's railways. The establishment of the European Railway Agency - which is the subject of a separate proposal - also forms an important element in this process. The Council adopted its Common on the 'Second Railway Package' on the occasion of its meeting (Agriculture) 11-26 June 2003 and has forwarded them to the European Parliament for a second reading in accordance with the co-decision procedure.</p>
<p>Taking into account article 42 of the proposal on a European Railway Agency, which proposes that the Agency shall be operational within 24 months of the entry into force of this Regulation, and without prejudice to the further proceedings within the context of the co-decision procedure, the Agency may be expected to become operational in 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0388"></a>

<p>On 9 June 2003, two Turkish F-16 fighter planes harassed an Olympic Airways aircraft on the Athens-Istanbul route, placing the lives of the passengers in direct danger. The aircraft’s automatic crash avoidance safety system was triggered and Greek fighter planes were forced to intercept the Turkish planes.</p>
<p>This action constitutes a clear contravention of the rules of international law and, more specifically, a violation of European Union airspace and thus of its territorial integrity, placing the safety of EU citizens in danger, and represents a violation of fundamental standards of international conduct, such as those enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the United Nations Charter and included within the Copenhagen criteria. It is a reflection of a systematic Turkish policy which leads to tension in relations between Greece and Turkey and directly threatens the peace and security of the region. In view of these facts, what urgent steps does the Council intend to take to put a stop to such aggressive acts by Turkey and to prevent their repetition in the future, and what consequences will the Turkish strategy adopted to date have on the assessment of the country’s progress towards EU membership?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The Council is aware of the incident mentioned by the honourable Member. It is also aware of information about claims for an increasing number of violations of Greek airspace by Turkish military aircraft, and of the sensitivity of this question - as well as of other issues relating to the Aegean - in Greece. Such incidents do unfortunately contrast with the general improvement in neighbourhood relations between Greece and Turkey over the recent years since 1999.</p>
<p>The Council considers that Turkey, as a candidate State, must - under the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the UN Charter - make every effort to resolve any outstanding border disputes and other related issues, as referred to in point 4 of the Helsinki conclusions. This is reflected in a specific priority of the revised Turkey Accession Partnership. In line with the Helsinki conclusions, the European Council will have to review the situation in this area, including its repercussions on the accession process, before the end of 2004.</p>
<p>In the framework of political dialogue, the Council is regularly encouraging Turkey to continue making efforts to prevent tensions - for instance through confidence building measures in sensitive areas - and to work together with its neighbour towards reaching an understanding on issues where views and interpretation of relevant international law are diverging.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0390"></a>

<p>1. The Council does not have to comment on bilateral matters between Cuba and the US, such as the actions taken by the US Interests Section in Havana, the treatment of the so called 'Miami 5', or the auctioning off of hijacked Cuban air-crafts by the US.</p>
<p>2. The Council on a more general point of view, strongly underlines that on the one hand, <br />hi-jacking of planes or boats cannot be tolerated under any circumstances, and that on the other hand, the EU regrets that the Cuban authorities broke the de-facto moratorium on the death penalty.</p>
<p>3. As clearly stated in the EU's 2002 Annual Report on Human Rights,</p>
<p>'The EU is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. That stance is rooted in a belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings. The EU uses all relevant international and regional fora to advocate the universal abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p>In countries that retain the death penalty, the EU aims at the progressive restriction of its scope and urges respect for the minimum standards set out in international human rights instruments and other documents, notably the 'EU Guidelines towards third countries on the death penalty', adopted by the European Council in June 1998.'</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0397"></a>

<p>The best way for the European Union to respond to developments of the kind the honourable Member is pointing out is to continue to strongly support further efforts to move towards a comprehensive Cyprus settlement, in the framework of the UN.

<p>In the 2003 Accession Partnership for Turkey, strong support to efforts to find a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem has been identified as a priority.</p>
<p>In order to help creating favourable conditions for moving towards a settlement, the Council also supports measures likely to bring about practical improvements on the ground and to bring people from either part of the island closer together. Such measures have been announced in the recent Commission communication on promoting economic development in the northern part of Cyprus.

<p>(IT) The Council would recall that its Office in New York was established in 1994 after the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union, as a direct consequence of the implementation of the CFSP. The Office had to provide Secretariat support and services in order to facilitate the implementation of Articles 11, 12 and 19 of the new Treaty, and liaise with the United Nations on issues going beyond Community competence.</p>
<p>The subsequent development of the CFSP and, significantly, the emergence of the European Security and Defence Policy, already accounting for three crisis-management operations under UN mandate, have rendered necessary the reinforcement of the Office, which is gradually taking place. As from 1 August 2003, the staff complement will be as follows:</p>
<p>1 A1, 2 A4, 1 A5, 1 B1, 1 B5, 4 C</p>
<p>Before envisaging any further reinforcement, synergies with the Delegation of the Commission are being explored. In this perspective, it is foreseen that the Offices of both Institutions will move into the same premises, fitted with larger meeting rooms and a common entrance, by the beginning of 2004.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in periods of intense activity, Member States put some of their facilities at the disposal of the EU for coordination activities. Any further pooling of assets seems, however, premature: as things stand, only States are members of the UN, and the Member States have distinct legal personalities and a distinct role therein.</p>
<p>As far as coordination with third states is concerned, participation of the acceding countries has not had a major impact and has not required substantial adaptations. Meeting rooms are however stretched to the maximum capacity and restrictions have been imposed on the number of participants (maximum 1 per delegation at the table). The situation is expected to improve after the move to the new premises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0410"></a>

<p>During this parliamentary term, the European Parliament and the Commission have been very committed to improving the situation of children in Romania.

<p>A recent briefing document for the EP includes the following statement: ‘concerns persist about the significant regional differences in the implementation of the reform programme (for child protection)’. There are also frequent reports of the deaths of children and young people who have been expelled from orphanages without having a secure environment to which to return. Furthermore, on 22 May, the Romanian press reported that the moratorium on international adoptions was to continue, which means that the legislation needed is not ready, in spite of huge international efforts and aid provided by the High-Level Group on the initiative of Baroness Nicholson.</p>

<p>(IT) As the Honourable Parliamentarian is aware, in the case of Romania one of the specific areas covered by the pre-accession strategy is that of childcare, an important issue on which the Council has already had the opportunity to respond to questions in this assembly. The Presidency can confirm that the Union continues and will continue to closely monitor the situation in this regard.</p>
<p>In the revised Accession Partnership for Romania that was adopted by the Council on last 19 May, inter alia it should be underlined that the priorities and intermediate objectives include the stipulation that Romania should: 'Continue the reform of the public child care system in accordance with the National Strategy on the Protection of Children in Difficulty, by focussing on closure of old-style institutions, de-institutionalisation and prevention of institutionalisation through provision of alternative social services for families and children'. The issue was also recently mentioned at Ministerial level at the latest meeting of the EU-Romania Association Council.</p>
<p>The Union continues to urge the Romanian authorities to make further efforts in this area. However the progress already made should not be underestimated, as noted in the Commission's 2002 Regular Report on Romania's progress towards accession. In particular, the number of children in residential care has been reduced, from 50 000 in 2001 to 43 000 in 2002, through other solutions such as assistance to families, foster care, family type homes and national adoption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to latest information available, existing regional differences in the implementation of the reform are likely to decrease in the near future, as best practices on child protection will be extended.</p>
<p>As regards the current moratorium on international adoptions, the Romanian government has prepared new legislation on children's rights, including legislation on adoptions, which will be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible. An independent group of experts in family law of the Member States of the European Union is examining this legislation and will transmit their opinion to the Romanian government soon. In the meantime, in the revised Accession Partnership, the EU has maintained the view that the moratorium on adoptions should remain in place until new legislation compatible with the best interests of the child and Romania's international obligations is in place and the administrative capacity to implement the new legislation is ensured.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The question of rural employment cannot be taken out of the wider context of the European Employment Strategy (EES), as defined by the 1997 Luxembourg Extraordinary European Council on Employment.</p>
<p>The 2000 Extraordinary Lisbon European Council set the goal of full employment and, in the medium-term, the goal of an overall employment rate of 70% (60% for women), to be achieved by 2010.</p>
<p>The 2001 Stockholm European Council set as intermediate targets for 2005 overall employment rates of 67% (57% for women).</p>
<p>The five-year review of the European Employment Strategy (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0416">COM (2002) 416</a> final) notes that over 10 million jobs (6 million of which are filled by women) were created in the five-year period 1997 to 2001.</p>
<p>The Council considers it of primary importance that the European Union should guarantee the application of the principle of equal opportunities for men and women living in rural areas and believes that the participation of women is vitally important to strengthen the new European rural model.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Agriculture Council approved the conclusions on the valuable contribution of women to rural development, which were based on the Spanish Presidency’s memorandum and the results of the work of the Conference on Gender Mainstreaming organised jointly by the Presidency and the Commission in Santander (Spain) in June 2002.</p>
<p>The Commission has consolidated the policies seeking to strengthen the role of women working in agriculture through the implementation of awareness-raising campaigns intended to bring about recognition of the contribution that women working in rural areas make to the economy and society, to encourage associationism, to encourage the promotion and creation of information channels and networks and to promote training and technical assistance programmes. These programmes, which have developed through Community initiatives, concern access to the labour market and training for women and provide for specific funding for women with entrepreneurial projects or the promotion of social infrastructure in rural areas. In view of these initiatives, the Commission has purposefully included specific provisions on the promotion of female employment in rural areas in the package of legislative proposals on CAP reform.</p>
<p>Moreover, in anticipation of a subsequent Council review, in the first half of 2003, the Presidency launched a debate on employment in rural areas on the basis of a working document, examined as a preliminary measure by the Special Committee on Agriculture on 2 June last.

<p>On a number of occasions the European Union has said that political negotiation is the only viable solution to the armed conflict in Colombia. Broad sections of Colombian society see a humanitarian agreement as the first step towards guaranteeing greater protection for the civilian population. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) stated in April 2002 that the international community should reject any move to involve the civilian population of Colombia in the conflict or any other expression of support for violence. The new government, in proposing the creation of the ‘democratic security policy’, is trying to involve the civilian population in the internal armed conflict by means of networks of informants, peasant soldiers and civilian guards.</p>

<p>(IT) The Council invites the Honourable Parliamentarians to refer to its conclusions on Colombia, adopted last December, which perfectly summarise the EU's position on all matters. On this occasion,</p>
<p>'the Council welcomed President Uribe’s efforts to reform his country’s institutions and to develop a fully functioning democratic state throughout the territory of Colombia, based on the respect for human rights and the welfare and safety of all its citizens. The Council also expressed its support to the Government of Colombia in its fight against terrorism as well as against illegal drug trafficking. It hoped for strengthened co-operation within the region in these areas.</p>
<p>The Council reiterated its full support to the efforts of President Uribe to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict in Colombia and underlined the importance it attaches to the contribution of the UN Special Adviser on Colombia in this process. The Council expressed the readiness of the EU to assist the Colombian Government in reaching a peaceful settlement of the Conflict.</p>
<p>The Council expressed deep concern with respect to the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the situation of human rights in Colombia, and urged the Colombian Government to increase its efforts in these areas and take effective action against impunity and collusion.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the political and economic reforms announced by President Uribe, with a view to address existing inequalities within the country and promotes sustainable development. At the same time the Council called upon the Colombian Government to recognise and support the role of civil society and Non Governmental Organisations as important stakeholders in carrying out these reforms and moving towards a negotiated settlement of the internal armed conflict.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council called upon Member States and the Commission to enhance the EU work programme with the aim to contribute to the strengthening of state institutions, the alleviation of the humanitarian crisis and the search for alternatives to drugs production.</p>
<p>The interventions of the EU should be prepared in close consultation with the Government of Colombia, the UN and the international community in Bogotá.'</p>
<p>This position was reiterated at various meetings with Colombian authorities, and also made public.</p>
<p>The EU is aware of the risks of involving the civilian population in the internal armed conflict and continues to actively support appropriate measures to bring about a negotiated solution to the conflict in Colombia - including by eradicating long-term economic and social causes of it. Wherever possible, this is done in close co-ordination with other donors and interested partners - inside and outside the region.</p>
<p>The meeting on 10 July in London is meant to prepare a future possible 'Donors Table'. The preparation of this meeting is actively pursued. At this occasion, the EU intends to send a clear message on the need for a comprehensive response to the crisis.</p>
<p>The EU urges all Parties in the conflict to accept a negotiated solution. It strongly condemned the recent murders and kidnappings.</p>
<p>The EU strongly believes that, above all at this time, it is necessary to avoid the further escalation of violence and every effort should be made to start up again as soon as possible the concrete search for a humanitarian agreement and a negotiated political solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>As concerns impunity, it is essential that future possible agreements do not grant impunity wholesale to the members of the illegal armed groups that have committed atrocities against the civilian population. Furthermore, it is important that the remaining issues concerning the affected civilian population be addressed, both in view of possible compensation as to the importance of a safe return for those who have been forcefully displaced.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0419"></a>

The decision envisages a comprehensive agreement leading to the creation of an 'open aviation area' between and within the United States and the European Union. The signing and the conclusion of any agreement which may result from these negotiations must, under Article 300(2) of the Treaty, be the subject of a further Council Decision based on a proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p>The voting procedure for this decision depends on the content of the draft agreement resulting from the negotiations. The Council shall decide by a qualified majority except if the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of internal rules. Regarding the involvement of the EP, a first reading opinion on the draft regulation on the negotiation and implementation of air services agreements between Member States and third countries has already been requested and is due to be adopted in September.</p>

<p>(EN) The Italian presidency of the Council shares the opinion of the honourable Member of Parliament that the drugs problem remains a major cause for concern throughout the European Union.</p>
<p>For this purpose a comprehensive program, based on the leading principles of continuity, coordination, consistency and efficiency, has been drawn up for the second semester of 2003. Key elements are concrete actions listed in agreed implementation papers on demand and supply reduction and synthetic drugs. Moreover the EU Action Plan on drugs with the Western Balkans, endorsed on 5 June 2003, will be in a first implementation phase. Work on the Action Plans on Central Asia and the Latin America/Caribbean will be carried forward specially after the successful meeting on 29-30 May 2003 in Cartagena with Latin American/Caribbean partners. The Italian presidency, as specific initiatives, has presented texts for resolutions on the Balkans, driving and drugs, training of drugs law enforcement officers in assistance of New Member States and Candidate Countries and the role of the family in prevention.</p>
<p>A meeting of the national drugs co-ordinators will be held in November 2003 in Rome with a special focus on coordination of external assistance.</p>
<p>The presidency intends to implement its program in full cooperation with the incoming EU Presidencies, Commission, Europol and the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0425"></a>

<p>(IT) The Council is not aware of the complaints to which the honourable Member is referring with regard to the homepage of the General Secretariat of the Council’s website.</p>
<p>The General Secretariat of the Council is starting to update the Council’s website, which will thus be fully revamped shortly.</p>
<p>Over and above issues of presentation, the honourable Member is aware that the Council’s website provides an exhaustive collection of information on the Council’s activities.</p>
<p>For example, it provides topical information under the ‘Newsroom’ heading, provided by the Council press service, which contains, inter alia, information notes on the Council’s sessions before the sessions and, at the end of each session, detailed press releases. In addition, when European Council meetings are held, special pages are created which provide comprehensive information on the meetings.</p>
<p>Another example is the ‘Transparency’ heading, which provides access to the public register of Council documents.</p>
<p>The public register, which has been operational since January 1999, is a database which provides access to various types of Council documents such as agendas, information notes, outcomes of proceedings, reports etc., as soon as they are produced or, in the case of legislative acts, after they have been adopted by the Council deliberating in its capacity as legislator.</p>
<p>On 3 June 2003, the register of Council documents contained 410 525 document references, including 208 611 documents accessible to the public. In 2002, the Council’s public register was visited by 950 000 citizens.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Council website as a whole received 6 310 729 visits, with a total of 37 111 913 pages consulted.</p>
<p>Thus, the pressure groups and lobbies may, if they so desire, follow the Council’s decision-making process using the above-mentioned tools, which are in addition to other steps taken by the Council to ensure transparency, such as opening up deliberations to the public, public debates and provision for direct contact with officials in accordance with the code of good administrative behaviour, which governs the relations of Council officials with the public.</p>
<p>Moreover, when ministerial meetings are held, as many representatives of professional organisations as there are seats available may be admitted to the press room.</p>
<p>Turning to the specific question raised by the honourable Member regarding the possibility of regulating the Council’s relations with pressure groups, the Council is not considering this possibility for the moment.</p>
<p>Since the Council deliberates solely at the proposal of the Commission when it deliberates in the capacity of legislator in first pillar sectors, it would appear appropriate for consultation with interested parties to be carried out by the Commission in accordance with the rules the Commission has established for itself (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0704">COM (2002) 704</a> final).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0403"></a>

<p>The plan to amend the plant protection directive (2000/29/EC<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) may have serious consequences for Finnish industry. In addition to those difficulties, the amendment may also have implications for the Union's external relations. The amendment of the directive would entail a deterioration in conditions in neighbouring areas. A case in point is timber exports from Russia to Finland which have been carried out for 100 years with no particular problem. The flora and fauna of the two countries are identical. Studies have shown that there is no risk of insects harmful to conifers in the relevant areas of Russia. The Finnish plant protection inspection authorities have been checking timber imported from the western regions of Russia for many years and no alarming observations have been made. The requirement that each consignment of conifers should be certified is therefore unreasonable.</p>
<p>Does the Commission share our view that the directive does not need amending? If it is not possible to avoid it, is it possible to leave the neighbouring areas outside the scope of the directive?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> published by the World Health Organisation aims ‘to contribute to the provision of safe and adequate nutrition for infants, by the protection and promotion of breast-feeding, and by ensuring the proper use of breast-milk substitutes, when these are necessary, on the basis of adequate information and through appropriate marketing and distribution’. Within the Community, Commission Directive 91/321/EEC<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on infant formulae and follow-on formulae regulates the compositional requirements and marketing practices for these products. The application of these rules in the Member States is the responsibility of national authorities.</p>
<p>The Community cannot legislate for third countries. Therefore, it is for these countries to take the necessary measures to apply the World Health Organisation (WHO) Code in their territory as appropriate. However, Council Resolution 92/C 172/01<a href="#defann_19_3" name="refann_19_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on marketing practices for breast-milk substitutes in third countries by Community-based manufacturers encourages compliance with the WHO Code. It also offers to examine any complaints about or criticisms of marketing practices, in third countries, of a Community-based manufacturer if those complaints are notified by the competent authorities of third countries.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the Resolution has been put into effect. The Community has instructed its delegations in third countries to serve as contact points for the competent authorities to notify any such complaints.</p>
<p>Certain non-governmental organisations have contacted Commission delegations concerning inappropriate marketing practices of Community-based manufacturers of infant formulae or follow-on formulae. However, complaints from non-governmental organisations are not covered by the framework of the Resolution. No complaints have been received to date from the competent authorities of third countries.</p>
<p>The honourable Member has asked the Commission to consider revising the Resolution so that complaints or criticisms from non-governmental organisations can be examined. This issue was extensively discussed during the adoption of the Resolution and it was clear that the Community and the Commission could not receive and pursue the examination of such complaints in the territory of a third country. Therefore the Commission strongly believes that it is not appropriate to revise the Resolution and that only complaints submitted by the competent authorities in third countries can be accepted and examined by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Five suicide attacks in Casablanca on 17 May 2003 left 41 people dead and around a hundred injured, including a number of Spanish citizens. The targets included the Casa de España and the Spanish Chamber of Commerce, with another attack taking place near an Italian restaurant.</p>

Antonio Gala wrote that 'terrorism cannot be fought with terrorism, whether national or international in origin', and F. López Agudín pointed out that 'it was inevitable that an illegal war, a blatant form of state terrorism, would strengthen Islamic terrorism'. Similar opinions have appeared in other European media.</p>

The Court also stated that shipment of waste in order for it to be incinerated in a processing plant designed to dispose of waste cannot be regarded as having the recovery of waste as principal objective, even if when the waste is incinerated all or part of the heat produced by the combustion is reclaimed.<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> In the Luxembourg-case, the Commission argued that incineration of waste where the energy is recovered in full or in part should be classified as a recovery operation. However, this was rejected by the Court.</p>
<p>The answer to the question of the honourable Member is therefore that, according to these judgements, incineration with energy recovery is regarded as disposal if that is the main purpose of the operations. As stated in the Communication towards a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission is still evaluating the consequences of the Court judgement with a view to take into consideration all legal, technical as well as economical aspects. This will involve contacts with Member States and stakeholders. The Commission would also welcome all input from other institutions, in particular from the Parliament and its Members to this process.</p>
<p>The potential influence of the judgements on the development of incineration capacity in the Member States is difficult to predict because investment decisions depend on a number of legal, economic and local circumstances.</p>
<p>In view of the available information, the classification of incineration within certain plants as disposal would not prevent the attainment of the reduction targets for landfill of biodegradable waste. The Landfill Directive requires that biodegradable waste is not put into landfills, however, it does not require such waste to be recovered. Furthermore, there are other ways of treating biodegradable waste, such as recycling, composting, bio-methanisation and use as fuel in a production plant.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2065/2001 lays down detailed rules as regards consumer information about fishery and aquaculture products. Those products on sale at retailers should show the commercial designation of the species, the production method and the area where the fish was caught. For farmed products, the indication of the catch area consists of a reference to the Member State or third country in which the product undergoes the final development stage. Where the product is farmed in several Member States or third countries, the marketing Member State may authorise the indication of those Member States or third countries. The Regulation also allows operators to provide more precise information on the catch area.</p>
<p>According to Regulation 2065/2001 of 22 October 2001, the correct information for farmed salmon whose final development stage took place in Scotland is 'salmon farmed in the UK'. It is also possible to add a reference to Scotland and display 'salmon farmed in the UK (Scotland).' In instances where the product was farmed in both Norway and Scotland, the United Kingdom may authorise the indication 'salmon farmed in Norway and the UK' or 'salmon farmed in Norway and the UK (Scotland).'</p>
<p>In the case mentioned by the honourable Member, it is not clear whether 'sourced in Scotland or Norway' is the only available information about the product for the consumer. Should this be the case, the description provided by the British supermarket would not comply with Regulation 2065/2001. Not only does this information not correspond to the requirements of the Regulation but also it is clearly misleading as to the real origin of the product ('Scotland or Norway') and the method of production ('sourced').</p>
<p>It should also be noted that control and enforcement of Regulation 2065/2001 falls under the responsibility of the Member States. Under Article 9 of the Regulation, Member States are bound to put into place regulatory measures concerning traceability and controls.</p>
<p>However, the Commission notes that a demand from the United Kingdom for the registration of the denomination 'Scottish farmed salmon' as a Protected Geographical Indication is in the process of examination by the Commission services under Regulation (EEC) 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs.'</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0371"></a>

<p>The Commission recently received a 'Systematic review of health aspects of air quality in Europe' from the World Health Organisation. According to this report long-term exposure to current ambient PM concentrations may lead to a marked reduction in life expectancy. The reduction in life expectancy is primarily due to increased cardio-pulmonary and lung cancer mortality. Increases are likely in lower respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function in children, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reduced lung function in adults.

<p>(EN) The laggoon of Vasova is part of the site 'Delta Nestou and Limnothalasses Keramotis' (GR1150010), while the Bay of Eleftheres is part of the site 'Kolpos Palaiou - Ormos Eleftheron' (GR1150009). Greece has proposed both sites as Sites of Community Interest (SCI) and thus they are part of the Greek proposal of sites to be included in the Natura 2000 network established by Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>With regard to the incorporation of the National Park of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace in Natura 2000, the Commission would like to inform the honourable Member, that the Common Ministerial Decision 5796/1999 designating the zones of Nestos Delta, lake of Vistonida and lake of Ismarida as a National Park is no longer in force. According to Greek law, the necessary legal framework aiming at the protection of the sites and complying with the objectives set out in Directives 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and 92/43/EEC is composed of an approved management plan (specific environmental study), a Common Ministerial Decision and a Management Body. The Greek authorities have adopted Law 3044/2002 which provides for the establishment of 25 Management Bodies for a number of sites that Greece has already proposed for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network under the Directive 92/43/EEC. According to the provisions of this Law, a Management Body for the area 'Delta of Nestos-Vistonida-Ismarida' has to be established. The process of creation and full operation of all the 25 Management Bodies is about to be finalised. The full establishment of these management bodies is expected to contribute towards the conservation objectives for these areas, the implementation of the approved management plans for the areas and their efficient protection.</p>
<p>As regards Council Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended by Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> (EIA Directive), Member States must ensure that, before a development consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia, of their nature, size or location are subject to a requirement for development consent and an assessment with regard to their effects.</p>
<p>The projects to which the honourable Member refers to, such as port installations, reservoirs of liquid fuel well as electricity generating units with a combined power of 1560 MW, may fall into the scope of the EIA Directive. Concerning the electricity generating they must ensure that they comply to Directive 2001/20/CE on emissions from Large Combustion Plants so that they minimise the impact of emissions on land, water and the atmosphere. However, it should be noted that, according to Article 1(4) of the Directive, projects serving national defence purposes are not covered. In addition, on the basis of the information submitted, it appears that the procedure for development consent has not started yet.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is assessing several complaints related to the deterioration of the 'Delta of Nestos', principally due to the absence of an appropriate legal framework for its protection and its conservation. The Commission is not aware of the development of other facilities and infrastructure in the sites of Delta of Nestos and Eleftheres Bay.</p>
<p>If the Greek authorities decide to proceed with the construction of the previously described projects, the provisions established by the EIA Directive should be applied. Moreover, as the sites have been designated under Directive 92/43/EEC, the Greek authorities should comply with the provisions and the procedure set out in Article 6 of the Directive. If an infringement of Community environmental law is established, the Commission will not hesitate to take all the appropriate measures, including the initiation of an infringement procedure under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An extremely serious rail accident has recently occurred at Chinchilla (Albacete province, Castilla-La Mancha region), just a few months after a similar one occurred at Tobarra, on the same line.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the Chinchilla accident (which, as at 5 June, had left 16 dead, 10 missing and 39 injured) was due to the fact that a passenger train collided with a goods train on a single-track line which lacked any automated traffic-control devices. Just before the accident happened a hazardous substance (sulphuric acid) had been unloaded from the goods train, which prevented an exponential increase in the scale of the tragedy.</p>
<p>The general public's response to such accidents is to ask what action the European Union is taking in order to investigate and prevent such occurrences.</p>

<p>(FR) The causes of the Chinchilla accident are the subject of an inquiry by the competent Spanish authorities, and so we should draw all our conclusions from that at a later date.</p>
<p>The Community's action in the field of rail safety will be stepped up over the coming years with the adoption of the directive on rail safety and the establishment of the European Railways Agency. The directive on rail safety and the regulation establishing the Agency are in the process of being adopted. Parliament should begin the second reading of these texts over the next few weeks. The Commission hopes that they can be adopted as quickly as possible, towards the end of 2003. That would allow us to start setting up the European Railways Agency during 2004.</p>
<p>The safety directive is intended in particular to oblige the Member States to implement a system of independent technical inquiries in the event of accidents (in addition to the judicial inquiry). This technical inquiry should be carried out transparently and the results should prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.</p>
<p>With regard to safety standards, the regulations already affect the transport of dangerous goods by rail (Directive 96/49 of 23 July 1996). Furthermore, the interoperability directives contain fundamental safety requirements affecting the subsystems of the rail system such as signalling and control. These directives are applicable whenever a new line is put into service or an existing line is refurbished.</p>
<p>Finally, the safety directive will allow us to gradually develop common safety objectives and common safety methods. These technical works will be promoted by the European Railways Agency, which will carry out the important task of creating a network of all national rail safety authorities, with a view to sharing experiences and methods for preventing accidents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0391"></a>

Also significant funds of the Community Assistance Programme for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) are being channelled by the European Agency for Reconstruction in Pristina to assistance programmes designed to strengthen the rule of law.</p>
<p>Progress in Inter-ethnic relations is a key element of the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations' benchmarks to measure progress of the Kosovo society in the context of the policy of 'standards before status'. The Commission monitors progress of these benchmarks in the meetings of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) Tracking Mechanism between the Commission and UNMIK and the PISG.</p>

It is emphasised that the levels of radioactive contamination which prevail at present, do not warrant any modification of the habits of people in Ireland, either in respect of consumption of seafood or any other use of the amenities of the marine environment'.</p>
<p>In addition, an important contribution to the artificial radioactivity levels in sea water is the remobilization of radionuclides from historical discharges, which can not be influenced by any measures at the present time.</p>
<p>While the Commission has competencies under the Euratom Treaty, in particular under Articles 35 to 38, the Commission has no competence enabling it to specifically establish a Commission inquiry concerning the potential effects of the radioactive contamination of a Member State.</p>

<p>On 10 June 2003 the Commission renewed the scientific and technological cooperation agreement with Israel to enable the country to participate in the European Union's Sixth Research Framework Programme (RFP) for the period 2003-2006. Israel is the only non-European country to have been fully involved in the EU's RFP and hence to have enjoyed special advantages. While the Fifth RFP (1998-2002) had been launched with a peace perspective - base, in particular, on the building of infrastructure for a future Palestinian state - the situation is quite different at present. This led the European Parliament to adopt a resolution<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on 10 April 2002 calling on the Commission and the Council 'to suspend the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement'.</p>

<p>With regard in particular to the entry of Israel into the sixth framework programme, the Union’s policy also responds to the Community’s political approach aimed at developing partnerships capable of contributing to the stabilisation of the region. In fact, the Commission believes that the development of relations with Israel will make a significant contribution to the Middle East peace process.

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees on the need to ensure the best possible cooperation between the Commission, the Council and the Member States in third countries and international organisations. This includes cooperation between diplomatic missions from Member States and Commission Delegations. This is, indeed, a Treaty requirement enshrined in article 20 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission, together with the Union Presidency and the Council Secretariat, is making significant efforts to achieve that objective. For example, in the case of the New York United Nations (UN) Delegation, a highly successful joint Commission/Presidency/Council Secretariat website accessible in all Community languages is now fully operational, containing detailed information on our cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Delegation and the Delegation of the Council Secretariat at the UN in New York are currently examining establishing in shared premises, which would facilitate significant synergies while providing for a more clearly visible Union presence.</p>
<p>Member States, together with the Commission, regularly coordinate their actions at the UN, as foreseen in article 19 of the TEU. This coordination has gradually increased and now covers the six main committees of the General Assembly and its subordinate bodies, including Economic and Social Committee of the UN (ECOSOC) and the subordinate commissions techniques. More than a thousand internal Union coordination meetings are conducted each year in order to prepare and finalise Union positions. Depending on availability, facilities owned by Member States and by the Union institutions are used as appropriate to coordinate EU positions. In past years, this coordination resulted in the Union achieving a common position on almost 95% of General Assembly votes. The Union has also spoken with one voice in the follow up of all the major conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990’s.</p>
<p>Even though the Commission’s Delegation in New York carries out a very significant volume of activities, current budgetary constraints do not allow, for the time being , to expand its budget. The number of posts for officials currently includes seven Administrators (A-grades), one B-grade and two C-grades, to which a number of temporary personnel must be added (local staff and other agents).</p>
<p>The Commission has recently adopted its Communication on Enlargement and the External Service, which foresees the transformation of Delegations in candidate Countries in representations. For the time being, however, the concrete EU-UN arrangements in the framework of enlargement remain to be agreed.</p>
<p>Without prejudging the outcome of the Inter-Governmental Conference which is currently reflecting on the draft Constitutional Treaty, the Commission is fully committed to work together with the Parliament to continue improving the effectiveness of its External Delegations, at the service of the Union. In addition, the Commission will continue to provide an increasing level of support to the Parliament, for example, arranging programmes for and accompany visiting delegations and Committees where necessary, or providing information and reporting, or through the attendance by Heads of Delegation of the Foreign Affairs Committee and other Committees of the Parliament, in order to report on recent developments in their host countries and the development of Union policy and programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0408"></a>

<p>The eastern part of Denmark imports electricity via the Öresund link from Sweden. Under the cooperation agreements between the system operators, Svenska Kraftnät reserves the right to suspend exports at 24 hours notice. Svenska Kraftnät takes advantage of this right in situations where capacity in the Swedish grid is in full use as a result of large quantities of cheap hydro-electric power produced in Norway and northern Sweden in the spring. A shortage of capacity in the electricity transmission systems means that not all production can be transmitted. This problem is resolved by dividing the southern region so as to break the link with eastern Denmark via Öresund. This allows the price in southern Sweden to be lowered while prices in eastern Denmark increase as Swedish imports are replaced by coal-generated electricity.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the transmission capacity constraints in the Southern Sweden and of the fact that these constraints have an effect on the transmission capacity between Sweden and the Eastern Denmark.</p>
<p>The Florence regulatory forum, a bi-annual meeting chaired by the Commission and incorporating regulators, the electricity industry, Member States and consumers, has discussed the issue of discrimination in allocating interconnector capacity between Member States in favour of internal lines in a control area. The conclusions of 6th Forum 10 November 2000 stated: 'Considering the fact that the European continental network is a highly meshed network and that the use of interconnection lines has an effect on the power flows on at least two sides of a political border, it should be ensured that no congestion management procedure with significant effects on power flows in other networks, be devised unilaterally. At least, co-ordination of congestion management procedures on both sides of an interconnection line should be ensured.'</p>
<p>It is thus clear that the regulators and the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) concerned should discuss the method applied.</p>
<p>Moreover, a Regulation on Cross-Border trade in electricity that has now been adopted contains guidelines for congestion management. These guidelines will be discussed in the next Florence forum in Rome 8-9 July 2003, and they will enter into force in July 2004. The issue of discrimination of interconnectors is one of the key items regarding the guidelines.</p>

<p>(EN) The donors’ meeting on Colombia that will take place in London on 10 July will be of a political, not a technical character. It is not meant to be a pledging meeting. But it will be a good opportunity to explain the Union’s perception of the situation in this country, to agree on priorities for the use of the Union's assistance, and to review the implementation of the pledges made at the previous donor’s meeting.</p>
<p>The Commission is fostering EU co-ordination towards a common EU position. The EU will reiterate in London its support for a negotiated solution to the conflict. Furthermore it will stress the importance it attaches to the good offices of the United Nations (UN) in this respect, as well as insist on the need for a comprehensive response to the crisis, that will include dealing with the socio-economic causes of the conflict, protecting human rights, providing humanitarian assistance, and partnership with the civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>The fight against impunity and respect for international humanitarian law, in particular the non-involvement of the civilian population in the conflict, is central to the EU's policy towards Colombia as is its support to the role of the UN in Colombia. This position has been repeatedly expressed in EU statements, and in the conclusions of the External Relations Council of December 2002. While supporting a peaceful settlement of the conflict, the EU stands by the conditions set out by the UN for a dialogue with any of the illegal armed groups and is adamant that a negotiated solution should not affect the right of the victims to justice, truth and reparation.</p>
<p>The Commission has raised in discussions with the Colombian government the fight against impunity and the fight against collusion between elements of the Colombian armed forces and paramilitaries. The Commission also promotes through its cooperation instruments:</p>
<p>administrative and judicial reform for which € 10,5 million has been earmarked in the budget for cooperation with the Colombian government (budget line B7-310); and</p>
<p>human rights defenders who fight impunity through the ‘European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights’ (budget chapter B7-70); 14 human rights projects for a total amount of € 13,4 million are now in operation. The Commission’s partners in these endeavour are NGOs, Colombian independent institutions such as the Ombudsman, and international organisations such as the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0421"></a>

It considers that the role of the Commission has been maintained overall, and indeed consolidated in certain areas. However, it also takes the view that the institutional balance and clarification of the role of the institutions are still unsatisfactory because of the provisions on the make-up of the Commission and the definition of the office of a more permanent president of the European Council. Also, the provisions relating to Community policies need to be reviewed in order to bring them into line with the realities of an enlarged Union.</p>

<p>Five years after the liberalisation of the electricity market in Spain the positive impact on competition it entailed have been neutralised by the dominant companies, which control almost 80% of supply and in effect determine the prices on the electricity market.</p>
<p>This is jeopardising the competitiveness of many SMEs, in particular Spanish textile companies, which are already experiencing serious difficulties because of fierce competition from developing countries with much lower wage costs and from 2005 onwards will have to cope with the elimination of quantitative restrictions.</p>
<p>In the light of all this, does the Commission intend to take any steps to put an end to what is virtually a monopoly and to allow the cross-border flow of electricity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Whilst a problem of interconnection capacity with neighbouring countries, does exist with respect to Spain, the development of the internal electricity market has nonetheless already shown positive effects : the prices of electricity in Spain have fallen consistently since 1997, as shown by Eurostat data, showing a clear positive effect on the liberalisation process.</p>
<p>Although 83% of installed capacity in Spain is controlled by the three largest generators, there are almost 150 suppliers, and more than half of the large eligible customers have been able to take advantage of the new competitive environment by switching their supplier or re-negotiating their supply contracts, as evidenced in the Commission’s Second Benchmarking Report<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Furthermore, it is important to note that the Electricity Directive has been effectively implemented in Spain: the Regulatory authority (CNE) is independent and efficient, the market is 100% open, and the transmission system has been ownership unbundled idem est the most effective way to ensure third party access.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to improve the conditions for developing the cross border trade of electricity. This objective is being pursued in two ways. Firstly, through the creation of a real, integrated and competitive single Community market: the recent adoption by the Parliament and the Council of a new energy market package is a milestone in this respect. Secondly, by supporting the development of new infrastructure for the transport of electricity, namely within the Trans-European Network-program framework. The capacity of electricity interconnection in Spain remains far below the objective of 10% of domestic consumption that has been identified by the European Council at Barcelona on 15-16 March 2002 as a minimum desirable level. The development of new lines with neighbouring countries must be one of the highest priorities for Spain, as for many other Member States in the coming months and years. A new Communication, considering further measures to accelerate this, will be adopted by the Commission by the end of this year.</p>
<p>In addition, it must be remembered that, in the context of a merger case last year<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the Commission obtained a commitment from the French Transmission System Operator to increase the commercial capacity of the interconnection lines with Spain.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The White Paper on Administrative Reform<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> states: «The Commission adheres to the principle of open government». In the White Paper the Commission committed itself to a more transparent dialogue with civil society organisations. These principles were confirmed in the Commission’s White Paper on European Governance<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As a practical follow-up to these commitments, the Commission adopted last year the General principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which lay down a general framework on how to carry out consultations in an open and transparent manner. Furthermore, the Commission published on the Internet a list of formal and structured consultative groups in which civil society organisations participate. The list was published in a new section 'consultative bodies' of the CONECCS database in June 2002. The CONECCS database also provides information on non-profit making civil society organisations operating at European level; the organisations’ list is made on a voluntary basis and it is only a source of information and not for accreditation.<a href="#defann_51_4" name="refann_51_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Finally, on the Your-Voice-In-Europe portal<a href="#defann_51_5" name="refann_51_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, which is the Commission’s single access point for consultation, everybody can see and participate in the open public consultations that the Commission has launched, and see contributions received.</p>
<p>By these commitments the Commission adheres to open and transparent dialogue with all external parties without entering into any registration or accreditation system with lobbyists. The Commission has always wanted to be open and guarantee equal access to all external parties. This principle was stated for the first time in 1992 in a Communication 'An open and structured dialogue between the Commission and special interest groups' in which the Commission also encouraged special interest groups (both profit-making and non profit-making) to draw up voluntarily codes of conduct which should include the minimum requirements as listed in the Communication<a href="#defann_51_6" name="refann_51_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
