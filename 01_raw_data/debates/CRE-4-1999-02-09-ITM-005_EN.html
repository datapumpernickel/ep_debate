<p class="contents">We welcome the improvement in relations between the EU and China, which are in the interest of ordinary people in both places, and which should boost the EU"s influence in international politics, independently of the USA. The EU should therefore support China"s accession to the WTO, in keeping with China"s multilateral principles. But, without denying that some progress has been made in resuming talks on human rights, such as the ratification of the two United Nations pacts on economic, social and cultural rights and on civil and political rights, I do not think that we can act as though China respected fundamental rights and freedoms. China is far from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and financial interests of certain EU Member States cannot justify a <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> that skims over truth and justice and means that we fail to apply common standards and demand less of China than of weaker countries with which the EU has economic or trade agreements including the human rights clause.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest serious violations of fundamental rights and freedoms in China – the persecution of political opponents, human rights activists and members of ethnic minorities – should be condemned by the EU in the strongest terms. The same goes for the violation of workers" rights, especially lay‐offs without compensation, and the absence of trade union freedom, collective bargaining and the right to strike.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come to the references to Macao.</p>
<p class="contents">In the motion for a resolution, we have: </p>
<p class="contents">’Hopes that the joining of Macao to China will comply on all points with the agreement of 13 April 1987 and enable it to develop a democratic and prosperous society on its own soil; "</p>
<p class="contents">In the explanatory statement, we find: </p>
<p class="contents">’Macao: another bridge between Europe and China</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the situation in Macao, whose return to China in December 1999 has been settled by an agreement signed on 13 April 1987, should be monitored closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Macao embodies a Latin culture, and therefore stands in direct connection with one of the fundamental components of European civilisation. Macao consequently is in a position to help improve relations with China by enabling that country better to understand our diversity as Europeans."</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the rapporteur has understood the role that Macao could play in the future, given its past and its special characteristics, as an ‘open door" for China into Europe and the west in general, and as a bridge between Europe, with all its diversity, and China.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should very closely monitor the handover due on 20 December next. It should be just as demanding as it was in the case of Hong Kong, <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span> , so as to guarantee that the principle of ‘one country, two systems" also applies to Macao.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still a number of problems about enshrining the rights and principles contained in the constitution, as guaranteed by the Joint Luso‐Chinese Declaration, into local legislation. The EU could give both parties, and the authorities of the territory, its backing with a view to achieving the following: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to guarantee that China respects the prohibition of the death penalty; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to ensure that China honours its pledge not to station troops in Macao; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to make sure that China duly stops criminals from crossing the border into Macao and threatening safety there; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to regulate and guarantee fundamental freedoms, especially religious freedom, freedom of association and membership of political parties, trade union freedom and the right to strike; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to regulate the use of the territory's two official languages – Chinese and Portuguese; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to regulate the issue of nationality, fairly and humanely; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to establish an independent judiciary with a local Court of First Instance.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should, both now and in future, support the development of a civil society; give its backing to associations including human rights organisations; support cultural activities and university cooperation with China; support the action of the European Studies Institute and foster exchanges between lawyers, enabling continental European law to be made known in China, in particular through the activities of the legal translation centre and the centre for training judges.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to repeat what it did in the case of Hong Kong – namely to issue a statement on future relations between the EU and Macao, guaranteeing from the outset that it will draft regular reports on developments in the situation after the handover.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU"s responsibility for Macao requires an active and competent Commission and EU delegation in the territory. I would like to ask the Commission what measures it intends to take or has already taken in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again may I point out to the Commission how displeased the entire EP/China delegation was that the Commission"s delegate to Hong Kong and Macao did not bother to meet the EP delegation in person or by proxy when it last visited the territory in mid−1998. I hope that this serious incidence of discourteous, incompetent and inconsiderate behaviour will not be repeated.</p>

<p class="contents">I think that the European Union must shoulder the main responsibility for steering China into the democratic fold. It must do so audibly, consistently and effectively, particularly by backing the notion of ‘one country, several regimes".</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is not treating Macao or Taipei with the attention that their status as outposts of democracy in the East demands. The European Union must show more determination. For that we need: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ European Union delegations in Macao and Taipei (not miserly little offices but fully operational agencies); </p>
<p class="contents">‐ clear support for either China or Taiwan's membership of the WTO; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ political action by Members of the European Parliament of all colours in support of Portugal in the final ‘sprint" to thrash out an agreement with China on a democratic and Sino‐European identity for Macao; </p>
<p class="contents">Although I agree with the Bernard‐Reymond report, I should have liked it to take a firmer line in calling for the European Union to shoulder its full responsibility.</p>

Special mention is made of concern for the quality of life in urban areas, and the demand for a minimum distance between landfills and residential or recreational areas is understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">That distance should obviously be several kilometres and this should be an immediate issue for all governments – sadly this is not the case with the Portuguese government – when dealing with toxic waste incineration or coincineration. It is unacceptable, given that it cannot seriously be claimed that there is no risk, that people"s lives and health are being put at risk, thus violating their rights.</p>

<p class="contents">In its proposal for a directive, the Commission gives every Member State the option to carry out unannounced roadside checks on such vehicles. We believe that this initiative has arisen out of concern for the respect of users" safety. In fact, if we look at how international traffic has increased, statistics show that a high number of vehicles travel more than 150 000 kilometres per year! Carrying out annual roadworthiness inspections is no longer enough to guarantee the safety and reliability of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur supports the proposal for unannounced roadside checks, and we are pleased with this. Yet for this initiative to have the greatest possible effect, we must implement a proper system of checks, with agents trained to the highest technical levels. In the same way, the Member States must cooperate with the Commission to strengthen approval procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, transport operators must not see this measure purely as a repressive one. Deciding to immediately immobilise a road vehicle when an unannounced check has revealed a manifest defect is a necessary step in protecting users" safety. We cannot allow ‘travelling bombs" to drive on our roads simply so that we can save money.</p>

What can our actions on economic and social cohesion and regional development amount to without vital infrastructure links? What can come of a policy for boosting employment if there is no real desire to provide transport links?</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it seems vital that we coordinate national efforts and that there is cooperation between public and private sectors. Until now, there has not been any significant progress in the field of goods and passenger transport. There is now more of a need than ever for fresh momentum. Too many projects are vague, with uncertain timetables and financing.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is in a position to monitor the level of progress, particularly where local and regional financing are concerned. It is, in fact, vital that public finances are contributed, in spite of current restrictions. Nothing can be done without this active role because, as in many fields, financial matters are at the heart of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the Camisón Asensio report, and I am disappointed by the serious delays and disagreements that have occurred in implementing the majority of projects drawn up in Essen in 1994. I also believe it is a shame that, in view of such a situation, the European Commission has not proposed measures to stimulate these projects and has simply accepted this state of affairs. It would perhaps be worth reminding the Commission of its mission and asking it to arrange for a Council of Ministers to seek solutions to the problems I have just highlighted.</p>

My main reason for voting in favour of the report was the explicit call to speed up the 14 Essen projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Early completion of the Essen priority projects is indeed crucial to the development of social and economic cohesion within the European Union. Together with the other trans‐European transport networks, these projects will strengthen the internal market and contribute to job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, Community structural policy must be coordinated with the trans‐European transport networks in order to promote balanced sustainable development within the European Union and to reduce the disparities that currently exist between the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the priority projects identified at the Essen summit are running well behind schedule.<br />This is due, amongst other reasons, to the lack of funds to implement them. An appropriate Community response to meet these financial needs would be to encourage public‐private partnerships, along with financial efforts by the Member State concerned. This would be of great help to the delayed projects and to the trans‐European transport networks as a whole.</p>

It is essential that all our citizens should be able to use it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific proposal relating to the introduction of the gold 100 euro coin, as put forward by the rapporteur, we are inclined to think that no real justification has been provided for the introduction of such a coin. In the vote, therefore, we have decided to follow the line adopted in committee by our political group.</p>

<p class="contents">This operation would be extremely costly for citizens in psychological terms and would serve only to provide ideological satisfaction for those who wish to see nations disappear. However, both could quite easily continue to exist simultaneously, as is the case today. There would be the euro, on the one hand, staying as it was when it came into force and restricted to the stock exchanges and to international financial activities. Then, on the other hand, there would be the national currencies which would remain in circulation. In any event, eliminating the national monetary level would hardly be wise, as we do not know what crises will emerge in the future. If an asymmetric shock hits us in the near future, we may very well be glad that we can modify the exchange parities between the euro and some national currencies in order to bring a certain amount of flexibility to the system and not force our fellow citizens to make unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, if we continue to allow both European and national monetary levels to coexist, we will have rediscovered a system similar to that of the common currency, which the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has always supported. Such a solution would safeguard our future without forcing our fellow citizens to take pointless risks. Therefore, I hope that the Council will listen to the voice of wisdom and that ministers will not charge headlong towards unification, as this would be a dead end.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to justify continuing with unification, some people will no doubt hide behind the legal argument in Article 109l(4), which states that ‘at the starting date of the third stage, the Council shall...adopt the conversion rates...at which irrevocably fixed rate the ECU shall be substituted for these currencies (the currencies of the participating countries)...The Council shall...also take the other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the ECU as the single currency of those Member States".</p>
<p class="contents">But this argument does not have the same weight as other legal arguments: in circumstances beyond our control, we can modify the text in an emergency or we can find another way to interpret it. For example, we could say that as the euro was due to replace the national currencies on the starting date of the third stage, in other words on 1 January 1999, then it has already happened and we should not discuss it any further. Governments would do well to seriously consider this line of thinking.</p>

<p class="contents">We should learn from the mistakes that were made, for instance, in the former Communist states of Eastern Europe.

<p class="contents">As cooperation with China increases, we should place greater emphasis on the social situation and those areas where we might be able to support development, such as youth exchange programmes, education and increasing the number of non‐governmental organisations.

But it is also important to stress that fundamental human rights are still being suppressed by the Chinese authorities. In its report, therefore, the Foreign Affairs Committee included some very positive demands for the incorporation of a human rights clause into the agreement between the EU and China. If economic cooperation with China is to be possible, it is of crucial importance that such a clause should be fully respected. The supplementary requirements which the committee has added to the areas prioritised by the Commission may help to point development in China in the right direction.</p>

The report claims that this is in line with the belief that intensifying relations with China will automatically lead to an improvement in the democratic and human rights situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy, which may prove to be effective in certain cases, seems, in the case of China, to come up against realities that must not be trivialised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now nearly 15 years since China began to modernise its economy and in these 15 years it has experienced unprecedented development. Western heads of state, company managers and buyers from the retail and distribution sector are now all rushing to Beijing and Shanghai to sign numerous contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we must note that although China has liberalised its economy considerably over the past 15 years, it has, in contrast, made very little progress in terms of civil liberties and religious freedoms. The policy on bringing Tibet increasingly under Chinese rule has not relented in the slightest over recent years, in spite of extremely strong pressure from the West.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general note, the very serious problems linked to violations of religious freedoms in China should have received more attention from our rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing a policy of compulsory registration for all places of worship in 1991 gave rise to the biggest wave of anti‐religious repression that has taken place since the cultural revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This new policy gives the Chinese authorities the means to completely control religious activity on spiritual and material levels. The Chinese Government has, for example, decided to control the content of the articles of faith of the various Christian religions, and is itself selecting which it deems acceptable and which are banned. The civilian authorities thereby label religious truths such as the Last Judgement, the communion of saints, genesis and the sanctity of life as forbidden truths.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with such pressure, many Chinese believers are joining ‘underground churches" and one of these is the illegal Catholic church. Followers of these churches are then subject to police harassment, confiscation of their possessions, imprisonment and torture. Members of the clergy are victims of particularly insidious torture. Such totalitarian practices do not spring from a bygone era but affect the daily lives of Chinese people today, and we must not disregard this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is usually more exacting on human rights issues. Why are we being so lenient with communist China?</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission is striving to ensure that the state aid map and the Structural Funds map are entirely consistent. We support the idea of a discussion in this field, taking into consideration the specific nature of certain regions that makes them eligible for Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, we are forced to acknowledge that state aids are exceptions to free competition for a very specific reason, namely that of maintaining economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States, in partnership with local authorities, must have a certain degree of flexibility. This will vary according to the development problems in certain regions, and I am specifically thinking of Objective 1 and 2 regions. It would not be a good thing to blindly apply competition rules and risk endangering the efficiency of Community and national interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the report by our Committee on Regional Policy is heading in the right direction, with finishing touches added by amendments the PSE Group submitted to this House. What is more, this request for flexibility was noted at the last General Affairs Council meeting. It will cooperate with Member States, local authorities and the Commission in order to determine the economic and social criteria specific to each region that allow them to be classed as exceptions.</p>

<p class="contents">The aim is to identify the regions most affected and to make European structural aid coincide with national regional aid. The Commission therefore thinks it is being pragmatic. But, more to the point, perhaps it is being too pragmatic!</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, until now, Objective 1 regions were determined by the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, such as NUTS regions where GDP per capita is less than 75 % of the Community"s mean. Objective 2 and 5b regions were determined by the Commission using Community and national socioeconomic criteria as a basis and in cooperation with the Member States. In addition, the Commission has exclusive competence in matters of state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In this new proposal, the Commission suggests also including the Objective 2 map in state aid maps under Article 92(3)(c). This amounts to saying that the Commission will include under the new Objective 2 all the regions that the Member States undertake to include in the list of assisted regions, which they must notify the Commission of under Article 92(3)(c). The proposal also suggests that Objective 1 regions be determined on the basis of strict respect of the 75 % criterion for GDP per capita, so that they fully correspond to regions that will be exempt under Article 92(3)(a) and can therefore be assisted at national level. And all this must be defined by 31 March 1999 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this is a little too rigid to be accepted in this form by governments, by our group and by this House, even more so as all states are calling for some flexibility in choosing their aid policies and in defining their territorial competences. I believe that making zoning systems consistent must continue to be a political objective for the Member States, without forcing them to obtain results. It is for this reason that the PSE Group has tabled several amendments, in particular a new paragraph after recital Q and a new Amendment No 6 calling for greater flexibility. These are amendments that I hope will be adopted by this House.</p>

These contradictions set European policies at odds with one another and the report highlights the paradoxical effects of these very same policies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, in fact, a major need to review and rationalise economic and social cohesion policy, that has been implemented pragmatically and sometimes erratically over the past twenty years to respond to successive enlargements and the different crises that have weakened the economic and social fabric of the Member States. This must be done in order to face up to fresh challenges and to better meet the objectives of this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this vein, I should like to offer my support for the options endorsed by our rapporteur. Therefore, in this speech, I will concentrate on two of the new measures proposed in the context of reforming the social cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this reform was designed to reduce disparities between the levels of development of European regions, it has in fact increased the disparities between the richest and the poorest regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing the share of aid cofinanced by the European Union would worsen this situation, as such a decision would effectively force Member States to make a larger financial commitment. This would, by necessity, increase the burden for the poorest Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a contradiction between the stated aims of social cohesion policy and the foreseeable outcome of measures taken to attain these aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also believe that the time‐limit for ‘phasing‐out" aid given to regions that previously had Objective 1 status seems too draconian for still fragile economies.</p>

Such a serious infringement of national freedom of action is unacceptable. I therefore support the committee's proposal that Objective 6 funding should be exempted from this linkage. According to Agenda 2000, Objective 6 funding which was agreed during membership negotiations would eventually be included under Objective 1. This is acceptable provided that the former Objective 6 support criteria are transferred, unchanged, to Objective 1 and that the funding for Objective 6 regions remains the same.</p>

This is an immensely interesting and important initiative. Under the current rules for support to poor regions and those lagging behind, there is a high risk of distortion of competition. There have unfortunately been examples of this. It is therefore crucial that the regional classification which will apply in future in respect of the scope for Member States to allocate regional aid should be defined in such a way as to minimise the risk of adverse consequences for free competition. I therefore fully support the analysis presented in the committee's report.</p>

<p class="contents">It is particularly concerned about the provisions of the new guidelines which limit the permitted intensity of national aid. For Objective 1 regions it is reduced to 40 or 50 % depending on the poverty of the region concerned, and for Objective 2 regions it is limited to 10 or 20 %. The report asks whether such a restriction could be paving the way for the gradual disappearance of national regional aid and, in time, for the pure and simple banning of such aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The report from the Committee on Regional Policy once again comes out in favour of changing regional planning policy in the Community. We could not support making this policy more systematic even though, in certain fields, we believe harmonisation or close cooperation is vital, such as in trans‐European transport networks or ecologically sensitive areas, for example. Yet Member States must maintain their freedom to use state aid, if they deem it necessary, to maintain the balance in their territory and to correct distortions induced, in certain cases, by some Community policies, such as the policy on free trade, the effect of which has not yet been evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I should like to point out that recital C of the report is the result of an amendment by our group that was adopted in committee. It points out that competition policy is essential to the competitiveness of the economy of the European Union, on condition, however, that this competition is conducted fairly, particularly on the part of certain of the EU"s trading partners, and does not have the effect of sacrificing our social and environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This text shows that the Commission"s recent decision to prevent France from awarding aid to its textiles industry, which had undergone a particularly severe relocation process, was unacceptable. This case is an excellent example of blindly applying competition as a dogma, regardless of social or regional planning considerations. This is a concept that our group is resolutely opposed to.</p>

<p class="contents">As well as this introductory praise of the content, I should also like to offer my full support for the recommendations made by our colleague. This constant wish to guarantee equitable access for all and, first and foremost, for the most vulnerable users among us, fits in with what should be a universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Following Mrs Read"s example, I believe that the Member States of the Union should consider implementing, by means of certain terms and conditions, a tariff scale adapted to low‐income users. If some people believe that such a measure is unfair, then what do they think of the majority of consumers subsidising the long‐distance calls of a minority? As a result, people who are poor or unemployed can only have low level usage paid for at full price. We must not forget that the telephone is also a useful job‐seeking tool.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the fact that the Internet is becoming more common calls for the implementation of adapted tariffs, both for individual users and for educational establishments. I have already said this but I should like to reiterate that the Web must not become the property of a well‐off minority!</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I should like to draw my conservative colleagues" attention to the amendments they wish to introduce. I believe that, in the long term, these amendments jeopardise equality of access to this means of communication. These proposals are dangerous, both for the telecommunications sector and for the future of the universal service on a more general level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am at last daring to hope that the right wing will be brave enough to declare their intentions in the coming months, in this field and in others.

This is why there is such major importance attached to this monitoring report on universal service in telecommunications, which we are examining today.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot fail to notice that this first report describes a situation that is far from satisfactory. It shows that the free play of market forces and competition cannot of itself ensure that everyone is properly included in the information society and in communication technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this first report points out a number of problems that must be rectified as quickly as possible. I would pinpoint in particular the fact that operators are under no obligation to use a uniform tariff for the same service throughout their territory. This is a serious threat to a true universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that some Member States show an overall upwards trend in tariffs is equally worrying, especially as it affects in particular residential users, especially those on low incomes.</p>

The Commission has noted that steps have been taken to secure this minimum access to telecommunications services for consumers, but the collection of data has not been entirely adequate in all cases. It is therefore right for the report to stress the importance of remedying these shortcomings, and of ensuring that the relevant information on the compliance of telecommunications services with the minimum requirements is available.</p>

As a result, I welcome the report by our colleague, Mr Mann, which responds to one of the main themes of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is important that this House promotes the emergence of these new jobs that appear to have great potential. I should also like to point out that I support most of the concerns and proposals outlined by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I will express certain reservations and make a few comments on different points that do not in any way detract from the author"s initial aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I agree with Mr Mann that society must invest financially to generally adapt training to such new sources of employment, I would like to make two comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe that we must invest a considerable amount, particularly as regards jobs with high added value. We have an obligation to do so, in view of the means needed to obtain quality training. Furthermore, I admit I was pleasantly surprised to note that our conservative colleagues are becoming aware that private initiative cannot cater for some of society"s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted by the willingness to legislate on life‐long training by including it in the law on entitlement to annual training leave. This request for legislation is an important step forward in terms of recognising this right, a right that must allow all employees to develop their careers and enjoy increased employability.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I cannot finish without mentioning some of the threats posed to workers" rights that, to my mind, must not adapt to new technologies but should instead aim to guarantee an acceptable quality of life for all. I believe that our fellow citizens will not indefinitely accept a deterioration in their quality of life, a quality of life that is very much threatened by a minority among us.</p>

The report begins with observations on the current state of affairs: an unemployment rate approaching 11 % in the European Union, of which 22 % are young people, and a precarious work situation for women.</p>
<p class="contents">These are therefore common sense measures as they place the emphasis on SMEs, which offer the greatest job creation potential but, in the context of increasing globalisation, must have favourable conditions in order to develop. The Commission has already established a number of actions to help them. We must increase the number of SMEs and encourage them. They are common sense measures as they emphasise the sectors of the future: tourism, culture, new technologies, research and media. There are so many fields that could breathe new life into our local authorities and our regions if we properly prepare access and training for future occupations. They are common sense measures as they call on Member States to implement the employment guidelines drawn up in Luxembourg in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">They are also common sense measures because they call for a system of further training that adapts to the constant development of new information and communication technologies. They call for a system that is capable of accompanying the worker throughout his career in such a way that he can develop as technology develops.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, these are common sense measures because they do not want to exclude groups of people, nor do they wish to further isolate regions that are already classified as less‐favoured regions. This is why there are calls for transport and telecommunications infrastructures to be developed to provide access to world markets, so that regions and their populations are not cut off from the labour market of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, they are common sense measures because they call for the principles laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty to be recognised, in particular that of equal treatment of men and women. Some of our French senators could certainly learn from this!</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this resolution, which analyses our society, the changes it is experiencing and its future prospects, is not a revolutionary one; however, if it were truly to be taken into account, it would mean the beginning of a better world.</p>

<p class="contents">We can therefore be pleased once again that the Amsterdam Treaty has fully gauged the scale of this challenge and has devoted a chapter to employment. Nonetheless, such awareness must result in tangible positive effects for our fellow citizens, especially for young people and women, as they are the most vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly support the analyses and recommendations outlined by our rapporteur, and therefore it is without any hesitation that I will vote in favour of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should particularly like to stress the fact that if we reorganise work according to opportunities provided by the development of multimedia, it will allow us to make substantial ecological gains for society as a whole. It will also result in improved quality of life for many workers who will no longer be forced to make arduous daily journeys.</p>
<p class="contents">Reorganising work in this way would ease congestion in access routes to major towns and would also allow us to eventually free up considerable human and financial resources that could then be used to concentrate on developing communications infrastructures in less‐favoured regions and in job‐creating sectors of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise that measures that use very little of the budget and are, on the whole, relatively easy to implement would also let us create jobs rapidly. For example, I should like to discuss rationalising and streamlining any form of red tape that places a burden on small and medium‐sized enterprises. Or we could even give such enterprises access to a powerful network for market research and for passing on the information gleaned from these markets.</p>

It concentrates on combating unemployment and ensuring that everyone has a job. No one is left out; there are clear references to women, for example. The report contains many excellent ideas about the labour market in the future. It is heartening that the European Union recognises the problems and is willing to focus on them. Sadly, what is otherwise an excellent report is spoiled by two unfortunate items.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, taxation is a matter for individual states. The European Parliament should therefore not ‘recommend' that tax ‘burdens' should be reduced, as is the case in paragraph 41.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more shocking is the ignorance displayed in paragraph 23. What the rapporteur refers to as the ‘tax burden on labour' is in fact employees' own money. The money which employers hand over to the state to be administered, in the form of payroll tax, is money which we have chosen to set aside, instead of taking a higher salary, to pay for sickness benefit, pensions and protection against unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Payroll taxes represent an increase in employees' salaries which they have chosen to forgo to pay for state welfare. Moreover, a system in which this task is undertaken jointly is the most effective and equitable kind.</p>

Consideration of the future will enable us to undertake sound preparatory work now, as we strive to do away with unemployment. This latter is currently at an unacceptably high level and is threatening the cohesion of our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim is to combat unemployment through the creation of sufficient quality employment, taking into account the new needs of a society that has changed and that will undergo further changes in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Information technology, communications, demography, sustainability, leisure – with the consequent growth of tourism – and, above all, the accession of women to the workplace, with more equal opportunities, all combine to create new needs for this new society. As I stated in my opinion, these needs call for an innovative, balanced and realistic political response. Such a response must bear in mind the great opportunities for job creation and respond to the new demands, whilst preventing new forms of discrimination against women at work as well as further uncertainty and deregulation. We should certainly welcome and support new job creation initiatives and the extension of social welfare and workers" rights aimed at guaranteeing social cohesion and full employment for both men and women.</p>

<p class="contents">We owe it to future generations to take seriously the long‐term implications of the uncontrolled emissions of CO<span class="sub">2</span> and its impact on the environment. Failure on the part of some Member State governments to cooperate fully in updating and reporting ‘new data" is unnecessary and only has the effect of undermining attempts to implement effective control programmes as envisaged in the Kyoto protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we have proper measurements then it is impossible to monitor the effectiveness of control programmes or the full extent of the threat from global warming to ‘future generations". Ignoring now what is accepted as a real threat will only make the final solution more difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Environment Ministers have agreed to reduce the EU emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8 per cent between the years 2008‐2012. The figures agreed will permit Ireland to increase emissions only by 13 per cent relative to 1990 figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has worked hard in implementing legislation which reduces the use of CO<span class="sub">2</span> gases. For example, the EU's new directive on regulating pollutants obliges oil companies to sign up to ensuring that the sulphur content in petrol is cut by a threefold reduction and that the sulphur content in diesel is cut by a seven‐fold reduction by the year 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">If the overall social, human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured then the standards laid down by the EU's recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be maximum cooperation between the EU Member State governments and all interested bodies so that a reduction in the use of CO<span class="sub">2</span> becomes a reality in the very near future.</p>

<p class="contents">In effect, the monitoring mechanism must form one of the essential parts of the Union"s general strategy on stabilising CO<span class="sub">2 </span> emissions at their 1990 level. This stabilisation will help to improve energy efficiency, whilst also allowing us to honour the commitments we made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. However, CO<span class="sub">2</span> monitoring alone is not enough. We need to monitor and stabilise methane (CH<span class="sub">4</span> ) emissions, nitrous oxide (N<span class="sub">2</span> O) emissions, gases that directly affect air quality, and gas emissions that have negative effects on the ozone layer, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<span class="sub">6</span> ).</p>
<p class="contents">Expanding our monitoring to include gases not initially provided for will allow us to carry out a more reliable analysis of all elements that harm our atmosphere. I should also like to remind the House that although the European Union has made visible efforts to maintain air quality, similar efforts must be made by all developed countries. Our efforts would be in vain if other countries did not bring their greenhouse gas emissions under control. This is why the action taken by Member States to extend the debate to world level is so important.</p>

<p class="contents">However, the proposal lacks muscle. The committee's requirement that the objective should be the elimination of sulphur as a pollutant is, on the whole, a definite improvement. The Council has accepted Parliament's demand that the directive should also include bunker oil and marine gas oil. At second reading, the committee has specified that implementation should be speeded up by bringing forward the deadline for fuel oils. I support the committee's proposal that the lower limit value for gas oils should come into force as from the year 2004, instead of 2008.</p>

That transformation was particularly noticeable in the past, when waste from the EU was exported to third countries. These countries may possibly have been able to extract a small amount of the metals contained in the waste, but it was not a very good proposition for the environment. There were also examples of third countries simply not being able to use the waste they accepted; they were simply paid for acting as the receiving country, in other words we used these third countries as dumping grounds because they were cheap alternatives to compliance with European environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules have given rise to much confusion and concern among humanitarian organisations which make collections for people in need. Let us make it clear that the collection of clothing for people in third countries who need it can continue. However, the new factor is that recipient countries must actively inform the Commission that they wish to receive the waste. That is the only way in which we in the EU can be sure that the recipient countries have actually decided that they want the waste we ship in across their borders. It is a guarantee that the countries can handle it in a proper way, according to their own rules. We must keep all unusable waste at home and treat it under our own rules in environmentally sound waste disposal facilities.</p>

<p class="contents">My disgruntled mood is not caused by the author of this report but rather by the Commission which, I believe, has behaved very casually towards such an important aspect of environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the increase in waste from urban areas there is, as the rapporteur underlined, a need to take steps to reduce the volume of landfill. In view of this, it would be most pleasing if the Commission were to take strong initiatives to promote alternatives such as composts and biogas from biodegradable waste.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I support the proposal to introduce a tax on waste going to landfill. How can we actually think that we have an infinite amount of space available for use as landfill sites? Health considerations are also part of the equation as no one can deny that this type of landfill is potentially dangerous, not only for the environment but also for human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I certainly support the hierarchy in waste treatment introduced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. However, once this hierarchy has been established, the Commission must take it into account when drawing up Community programmes related to such issues.</p>

However, I would continue to point out that the greatest threat to the ability of Member States to set up national waste disposal systems which go further than the rules that can be adopted at EU level remains the EU's internal market. As long as waste in the EU's terminology continues to be treated as merchandise, there will be an incentive for large producers of waste in EU countries with strict rules on waste management to ship their waste to facilities in other Member States which only comply with the EU's minimum rules.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is not made possible, not just in principle but also in practice, to put a stop to this waste tourism across the EU's internal frontiers, the environment will continue to suffer. At the same time, we should not forget the economic damage to waste disposal facilities located in environmentally progressive EU countries. Their facilities will lose quantities of waste, perhaps to a neighbouring country with its cheaper solutions.</p>

Landfill of waste should, as the rapporteur says, be an option of last resort. Landfill is necessary in some cases. We must accept that. The problem is that in many EU Member States it has become the easy option with dire consequences for the environment. Stricter controls are necessary. People in residential areas should not have to put up with unsightly and potentially dangerous sites in their neighbourhoods. At the same time we should have a much better programme in every state to encourage people to dispose of waste with more regard to the environment. I know that in some countries there are already schemes for the separation of household waste to provide for better recycling. I trust that this will eventually become the norm in every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the responsibility of Member States to improve waste disposal, using alternatives to landfill, without penalising the taxpaying public. The landfill tax in my country is a prime example of how an ill‐conceived idea that does not address the real problem can lead to taxpayers being out of pocket. Without a strategy from central government to rethink waste disposal, the landfill tax simply means that local authorities find themselves with no alternative but to pass the cost on to ratepayers. How this contributes to reducing dependence on landfill is anyone's guess.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that in the future we will have a much better approach to waste disposal in the EU. It is essential that landfill becomes, as far as possible, a thing of the past. To achieve this compliance with the legislation is essential. Member States must embrace this legislation if it is to have any effect.</p>

But unfortunately it is lacking in a number of key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will have major implications for waste disposal throughout the EU and especially in Ireland where waste management has tended to focus exclusively on landfill. Despite the fact that landfill is considered the least‐favoured option for waste disposal in Europe, Ireland comes top of the EU list for using landfill to dispose of its huge waste mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the second attempt at an EU landfill directive. The Commission first submitted a proposal in 1991, which was withdrawn after Parliament, under pressure from environmental groups, rejected the Council's common position in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Although in some respects the proposal is much better than what was presented in 1996, I am concerned that a number of aspects of the legislation are very weak and could result in governments finding ways to opt out of their commitments on waste management and public health protection.</p>
<p class="contents">One major problem is the possibility that landfill sites which have closed at the time of transposition of this directive will be excluded from the remit of the legislation. Authorities are already planning to close down a significant number of currently active landfill sites in Ireland over the next two years. Some of these are extremely problematic sites. Since aftercare is an important part of the directive, it is essential that these sites due to be closed come under the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely disappointed with the attitude of the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection for not insisting that a minimum distance from the site boundary to residential areas be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Commission had originally proposed stipulating a minimum distance of 0.5 km from the site boundary to residential areas but the Council of Ministers deleted this from the text of the draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of distance is extremely important to community groups throughout the EU. Especially since research (published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> , August 1998) has shown that infant mortality and birth defects increase by as much as 33 % in host communities within a 3 km distance of landfill dumps.</p>
<p class="contents">This failure to set a minimum distance and thus protect local communities from the dangers of landfill goes against the precautionary approach and the protection of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Group tabled an amendment on the issue and will be requesting a registered vote so that local communities at home can see how serious MEPs are about protecting public health. We find it incredible that so many MEPs would reject measures to ensure that public health is protected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth pointing out that in the original proposal from the Commission a minimum distance from residential areas was included and was later removed by the Council. The Commission should have stuck to its original position and the Socialists should not have done a U‐turn on this issue either. They have failed miserably in their responsibility to protect public health.</p>

Indeed, if one of the Member States had lax legislation, we could easily find ourselves faced with the problem of waste being relocated. Member States with stricter legislation would obviously transfer their waste to the less strict Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our group points out that the Member States must retain sovereignty as regards setting a tax or fee. This is why we voted against the amendments providing for a European tax on the landfill of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">On a technical note, we voted against the amendment replacing the term ‘inert waste" with the term ‘non‐hazardous waste". I know from experience that in the European Parliament"s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, the majority of Members prefer the term ‘non‐hazardous waste". At what stage can we decide that waste is non‐hazardous? Initially, some people may wish to use a sufficiently vague definition and then later draw up increasingly strict standards, or even unrealistic ones. This would have severe financial repercussions both for economic operators and for local and regional authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our group voted against the amendment seeking to shorten the time‐scale for applying the directive. It is important to allow enough time for local authorities and waste sector operators to conform to the directive. I should like to point out that any standard and any decision will only be accepted if it is realistic and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, our group did, of course, vote in favour of the recommendation at second reading and in favour of the majority of amendments promoting biodegradable waste, which is the most environmentally friendly form of waste.</p>

The whole report has been referred back. I hope this Parliament will now look at the implications for taxation on those products which are manufactured using energy. In particular in the ceramics sector we have a policy in the European Union of encouraging employment, and having a resolution which will tax one sector unilaterally is going to be very difficult. We now have a second bite at the cherry. I reserve my right to come back on this when it goes back to committee.</p>

Consequently, we have decided to vote for the highest possible minimum level of taxation on electricity and fuel. On the question of whether to exempt energy‐intensive industries, in our view the Commission's proposal has advantages and disadvantages. There is a danger that imposing very high taxes on energy‐intensive industries will mean that their competitiveness in relation to their counterparts outside the Union will be impaired. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that energy‐intensive industries represent a major source of tax revenue if we are to meet the environmental objectives by means of a tax trade‐off.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it should be noted that exemptions for energy‐intensive industries could put the enterprises against whom they are competing, but which do not use energy‐intensive methods to produce their products or materials, at a competitive disadvantage. In adopting a position on the taxation of energy‐intensive industries, we have decided to strike a balance between these approaches.</p>

The Commission's original proposal had a long series of complicated grounds for exemption, but the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has proposed a better solution. Its effect will be that firms which can show that they will suffer a competitive loss as a result of the duties may be exempted from paying them. This proposal builds on the EU's active employment policy in providing a reasonable stimulus for a change in tax systems so that the taxation of labour is reduced, while at the same time taxes on the use of natural resources are increased. This is a green policy with an employment objective.</p>

The Commission proposal tried to steer a course through them all, but the complex result remained stranded on the sandbank of the status quo. The European Union cannot afford to let this happen. It must respect the undertakings given in the UN Framework Treaty on Climate Change.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right in starting from the assumption that the polluter must pay. It is not a question of saddling taxpayers with extra taxes, but of making the polluter face up to the consequences of his behaviour. Our ultimate goal is to reduce harmful emissions and improve public health and the environment. Member States must therefore make a serious start on reducing secondary labour costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Member States must be given maximum scope on the exemption options, so that one Member State can pursue a stricter than average environmental policy on the one hand, and its own exemption policy on the other. Of course this policy must not negate the objectives of the Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We voted against Amendments Nos 37 and 38, as they are inconsistent with the rapporteur"s proposals. Above all, people have to realise that transport prices in general are too low in relation to the external effects which transport causes. We supported Amendment No 29. The international exemption for aircraft kerosene must be abolished as quickly as possible. Until an agreement on this seems to be within reach, an EU regulation on a fly‐over tax would seem to be a good temporary solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we believe that this regulation will be more readily accepted if we fix the minimum rates for a period of five years. Companies will then know a long time in advance what they are going to be faced with. The indexing of minimum rates introduced by Mr Cox is a good way of making the regulation simple and reliable.</p>

The proposal for a Council directive, as amended, largely meets these criteria. I also support the line taken by our rapporteur in advocating a strict application of the ‘polluter pays" principle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that any increase in tax measures in order to better protect the environment is accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the tax burden on labour. Through the principle of tax neutrality, better respect for the environment will make a positive contribution to the fight against unemployment and to job creation, which is something that we all need. And it will do this without jeopardising the financing of social security, the pride and joy of the European development model.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in the final analysis, it would seem that our rapporteur only partially takes into consideration the different environmental aspects of the issue. This explains why he supports, for example, preferential tax treatment for more environmentally friendly modes of transport, and quite rightly so, yet does not distinguish between whether or not the energy used has harmful effects on the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The implication behind the proposals is that ‘the common minimum rate will apply equally to electricity and heat generated by solar, wind or combined heat and power and to that generated by coal". One may think, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection does, that there is a gap that must be filled as rapidly as possible if the Union and its Member States are to honour their international commitments concerning climate preservation.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, we should seek to develop this proposal a little further along these lines.</p>

The reason why I am withholding my support is that I do not wish to contribute to any decision whereby policy on taxes and duties is determined to an ever‐increasing extent by the EU. There may be many good reasons why countries should negotiate common minimum rules for the taxation of areas such as energy consumption – concern for the environment, as well as concern for fair competition between countries – in various international forums such as the UN, the Council of Europe, the OECD, the WTO and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the Cox report and the proposal for a directive on which it is based are a glaring example of the creeping harmonisation of Member States' tax and duty policies which is currently taking place in the EU: harmonisation which is motivated first and foremost by concern for the internal market, but to an ever‐increasing extent by concern for EMU and the single currency, the euro; harmonisation which is logical and correct, if one is an advocate of the EMU and the euro. I am not an advocate of either the euro and EMU or the internal market, and for that reason I shall not be supporting the Cox report.</p>

However, the Commission's proposal contains far too many exemptions for energy‐intensive industries, in other words those which should by rights be taxed. As a result, the legislation is complex, hard to understand and difficult to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee's proposal broadens the tax base by removing some of the exemptions. The committee also proposes that the Member States should be entitled to allow firms a tax‐free period if they can demonstrate that it really puts them at a competitive disadvantage. General exemptions should only be granted on renewable sources of energy such as bioenergy and solar and wind power.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee proposes that tax rates should automatically be reassessed in line with inflation, with an extra 2 % increase every year, to enable industry to plan ahead. This is a good way to proceed. However, I have voted to raise the level to 4 % in order to facilitate compliance with the Rio, Kyoto and Buenos Aires declarations on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
