<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the</span> <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, former colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council meeting in Copenhagen will play a decisive role in the conclusion of the Danish Presidency. The agenda will focus on two subjects: enlargement and the functioning of the Council in the light of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting, the Chairman of the Convention will brief the European Council on the status of the Convention’s work, and, in addition, the European Council will meet with the President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox. Let me start with the latter. The meeting with the President of Parliament is of course an established tradition at meetings of the European Council; a tradition that the Heads of State and Government view as important and valuable. It is important that the institutions have a regular opportunity to exchange views and discuss key European questions, as we are also doing here today; and as the Danish Prime Minister and I did last week, when we were visited by Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, and Mr Cox, President of Parliament. I am quite sure that the meeting is fresh in their minds.</p>
<p class="contents">If enlargement succeeds in Copenhagen, and it will, this will be another product of the hard work put in by the institutions and their effective cooperation over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will be the most important item on the agenda of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen. For some months the pace of the accession negotiations has been very fast. We are now close to taking the decision that will seal the reunification of the continent of Europe: the conclusion of accession negotiations with the first group of candidate countries with a view to their accession on 1 May 2004. This has been incredibly difficult and complicated, and it has not yet been resolved. The fact that the possibility of concluding the negotiations now seems to be a reality is due in no small part to the positive result that was attained at the European Council meeting in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Brussels European Council concluded that ten countries will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004. The final and decisive negotiations are now taking place. Last week, the Presidency presented a negotiating package for each of the candidate countries. These packages represent the Presidency’s proposal for a definitive resolution of the negotiations. They take into account – as far as possible – the views of the candidate countries, as presented at separate meetings with each individual country, and they are in line with the financial framework for enlargement, that is to say, with the Berlin Agreement and with the decisions from the European Council meeting in Brussels in October.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency hopes that we can cover a lot of ground – as much as possible – in the negotiations before the European Council meeting in Copenhagen. It is no secret that the final negotiations will not be easy. Given the right willingness to compromise on the part of both present and future Member States, however, I am convinced that we <span class="italic">shall</span> achieve a successful result.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement does not end in Copenhagen, however. The European Council also wants to give new impetus to the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania. A decision will be taken on detailed roadmaps and timetables, and pre-accession aid, in order to move forward the accession process with Bulgaria and Romania. The Commission’s communication of 13 November on a roadmap for the two countries is a good step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last European Council meeting, in October, the EU welcomed the new reform work in Turkey. The countries of the EU were unanimous in emphasising that the many important reforms in Turkey have expedited the start of accession negotiations with that country. Turkey’s accession will follow the same principles and criteria as those applied to the other candidate countries. The EU is in the process of preparing the decision on the next step in Turkey's candidature. This decision will be taken at the Copenhagen European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency hopes that a solution to the Cyprus issue can be found ahead of Copenhagen. The EU supports wholeheartedly the UN Secretary-General's endeavours to find a solution. If a solution is not found to the political conflict in Cyprus at the Copenhagen Summit, the EU will take its decision on the accession of Cyprus on the basis of the conclusions from the Helsinki European Council in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting the accession date for the new Member States entails a number of institutional consequences, and it is obviously important that Parliament is fully involved in the discussions on these consequences. I myself have had the pleasure of informing Parliament at all stages of these deliberations. I have already had the occasion to discuss matters: during the last session in Strasbourg, where this and other questions were raised by Mr Barón Crespo; and also last week in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, where we discussed the subject at length.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency fully understands Parliament’s keen interest in the institutional consequences of enlargement, and is willing to enter into an open discussion on these matters. At the same time, I must also draw attention to the complicated negotiating process under way at this time with regard to enlargement. Agreement must be reached not only within the Council (and within the other institutions), but also – and this is particularly important – with the future Member States. It can be said, therefore, that it is an ongoing, intensive process in which we do not have all the answers yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional questions are pressing. They are a necessary part of enlargement as a whole. Questions such as the weighting of individual countries’ votes in the Council and the countries’ representation in the European Parliament constitute an essential part of the accession treaty. We need to make a start now on laying down clear provisions for the transitional period. What we are talking about is primary legislation in line with the treaty. In this connection, I should like to make the point that the European Parliament will have to give its assent, and that the accession treaty needs to be ratified in both existing and new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement on the accession date of 1 May 2004 is based on detailed discussions on what is desirable and what is possible in the light of the ratification process in both the present and the future Member States. We owe it to the future members not to delay accession for any longer than is absolutely necessary. I believe this goes for us all: Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This means that there is a need for certain transitional arrangements. This was also the case with previous enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been suggested in Parliament that the 2004 elections to the European Parliament be held on an earlier date, for example 9 May. I personally sympathise with this view. The matter was discussed in detail over many years in connection with the revision of the Common Act on direct elections, which has recently been amended (published in the Official Journal of 21 October 2002). All sorts of dates have been considered, but in vain. Unfortunately, I do not believe that further attempts to change the date will bear fruit. It is not the Presidency, however, that is standing in the way of a different, earlier, date.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament appreciates the situation that the Commission will find itself in during the period between the accession of the new Member States and the investiture of the new Commission. Obviously redistributing the portfolios within the Commission for a period of just half a year is not a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency hopes Parliament accepts that the interim Commissioners from the new countries will not be subject to hearings or approval by Parliament. This avoids any possibility of prejudicing the new Parliament’s opinion of the new Commission. It is of course unacceptable to the new Member States that ‘their’ Commissioners should be approved by a Parliament in which the new countries are not yet represented by MEPs with voting rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed solution avoids any possibility of prejudicing the choice of candidates by the President-designate of the European Commission in the composition of the new Commission. It goes without saying that, if the Commissioners from the new countries do not have a portfolio during the period up to the investiture of the new Commission, there is very little point in Parliament's specialist committees holding hearings of the new Commissioners and examining them in specialist areas they do not have. This is why I hope that Parliament can see its way clear to agreeing to the new Commissioners being appointed on the basis of a simplified procedure in the transitional period, until a new Commission can be appointed with the full involvement of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the question of the full participation of the new Member States in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. The Council has a clearly defined position on this matter. The new Member States must be placed on an equal footing with the old Member States in the negotiations that will shape their and our common future. And, like the old Member States, they must of course have the right of veto. We cannot in decency do otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">I have endeavoured to explain the complicated institutional consequences of enlargement. I am looking forward to our debate. I will listen very carefully and am open to all good suggestions for realistic alternative solutions. The Council will discuss the institutional consequences of enlargement once more at the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been agreed that I shall be present myself at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 10 December. This will be an opportunity for me to brief the competent parliamentary committee on the latest developments, and for a discussion on their significance. In my opinion it is natural that the discussion should take place within this committee, but if Parliament should wish for a different forum for the debate, on the date in question, 10 December, I am, of course, at your disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Seville European Council instructed the Danish Presidency to continue working on the question as to how the presidency will function in the future in an enlarged EU. The Presidency was to present an initial report at the meeting in Copenhagen. This will mean that we can have an initial orientation debate on the subject there. The Presidency’s report has three models for the form the presidency could take in future, and the report deals in this respect with the question of strengthening the role of the High Representative and the possibility of having an elected President of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the intention that the European Council will take a decision on the models. The Presidency will suggest that the further work on shaping the presidencies of the future be continued in both the Council and the Convention, and, as far as the latter is concerned, this forms part of its general discussions on the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting in Copenhagen, the Chairman of the Convention will give a report on the progress that has been made in the Convention. This dialogue is very important. With the presentation, last month, of a draft Constitutional Treaty, the work of the Convention entered a decisive phase. The discussions on the details within the framework the chairman presented are making rapid progress. The basis for the Convention’s end product is now being created. In this connection, it is good to see that the draft Constitutional Treaty has given rise to a Europe-wide debate on the form the Europe of the future will take. It bodes well for our common ambition to create European cooperation which is more democratic and has grass-roots support.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the whole of its term, the Presidency has worked towards seeing to it that the work in the Convention unfolds in accordance with the aim of producing a good and well prepared input to the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">As will have been clear from my statement, the European Council has an extensive and ambitious agenda for its meeting. It is my hope and belief that all the countries at the meeting will show the necessary willingness to compromise and help to take the important decisions I have spoken of here.</p>
<p class="contents">In Copenhagen we hope to be able to take a historic decision on the greatest enlargement in the history of the Community to date, and I also dare say the enlargement with the most far-reaching consequences and the broadest historical perspective. The great debate on enlargement that took place in Parliament last month is just one example of the strong will Parliament has shown, and the efforts it has made, to make this project succeed. And, as I said at the start, this great project can only succeed if the three institutions work closely together. I believe that they have done so, and I should like to thank Parliament once more for the clear messages it has given out all along when it comes to the enlargement ahead of us.</p>

Almost ten years on, we are nearing the end of that process. At the end of next week, the Heads of State and Government will be back in the Danish capital to take the final decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is on the agenda at Copenhagen? Basically three points. The negotiations need to be wound up with the ten candidate countries named in the Commission's report of last October, the pre-accession strategy to help Bulgaria and Romania speed up their preparations for membership needs to be strengthened and a decision is needed on the next steps in Turkey's candidacy. I will expand on these three points today.</p>
<p class="contents">First, however, let me say something about the decisions we must take to organise the three great changes which will take place in 2004: the accession of the new Member States, the appointment of the new Commission and the European Parliament elections. We can now establish the heavy schedule of political and institutional events in 2004 in the light of the reflections taking place in Parliament on how to organise the various deadlines related to the arrival of the new Member countries and the European elections. I think the recommendations we are getting from the Council can, if necessary, be revised and supplemented to accommodate Parliament's specific needs in the best way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest we organise things in the most practical order and, where the Treaty is silent, that we use common sense. Politically, it is highly significant that the European elections should be at the centre of the institutional activities related to enlargement. The new Parliament will open its doors immediately to the new Member States' elected representatives, who will come in as full members of this House, and it will thus be able to approve the appointment of the new body of Commissioners legitimately, and they will take office as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">How is the Copenhagen Summit shaping up in terms of the main point on the agenda – enlargement? The Brussels European Council brought agreement within the Union on the broad outlines of the offer to the ten candidate countries, in particular as regards the agricultural and budgetary issues. The European Council's conclusions were presented immediately to the Heads of State and Government of the candidate countries, who reacted favourably to them on the whole. Nonetheless, many issues still have to be resolved before an agreement acceptable to all concerned can be reached. The Presidency of the Council and the Commission have worked – and will continue to work – ceaselessly to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into detail on the discussions under way, I will outline some of the main points. Firstly, we need to find a suitable way of respecting a principle we all agree on. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 the net amounts received by the candidate countries from the European Union should not be lower than those they receive in 2003. Secondly, the candidate countries need assistance to prepare better for the task of controlling the Union's external borders. This means enabling them to carry out their tasks under Schengen properly. Lastly, we need to solve certain specific points relating to the agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, the Commission fully supports the Danish Presidency in its efforts to reach the necessary compromise on all these matters. Some Member States have expressed reservations regarding the substance of the offer to the candidate countries. We, however, do not share their view. Like the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rasmussen, I consider that a reasonable offer should be made – an offer that allows the candidate countries to defend the Copenhagen outcome before public opinion in their own countries. We must keep within the overall framework laid down at the Brussels European Council, but openness, flexibility and generosity are also needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, last week, I appealed publicly to the leaders of the candidate countries to show realism in this last lap of the negotiations. Indeed, I note that many points are still unresolved and we have only a few days left. We are skating on thin ice and progress must be made. There are times in history when narrow sectoral interests, however legitimate, must give way before the general interest. That is the law of democracy and we must apply it. I want to reiterate earnestly that most of the points of the final compromise must be decided at the forthcoming General Affairs Council meeting on 9 and 10 December. We cannot leave the Copenhagen European Council to decide on dozens and dozens of details.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, before this House, I appeal to the good sense of the leaders of the candidate countries and the leaders of the Fifteen. The remaining difficulties must be settled quickly in the same spirit of partnership and friendship that has presided over all the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on the latest developments regarding the conclusion of the negotiations with Cyprus. As you know, the European Union has always backed the endeavours of the United Nations Secretary-General and, in the last few weeks Kofi Annan has taken the courageous initiative of putting forward a plan for a global settlement. That plan has our full backing. The reactions of the parties concerned have, on the whole, been positive. They have accepted these proposals as an appropriate basis for a settlement and, in the next few days, they will respond with their proposals. We hope these contributions will allow Mr Kofi Annan to make more progress towards a solution. We have already formally stated that we are ready to take account of the terms of such a settlement in the accession arrangements for Cyprus, and we will endeavour to do so if such an agreement is reached. In any case, the commitments entered into at Helsinki remain valid for the candidacy of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Bulgaria and Romania, the Copenhagen European Council will have to adopt the Commission's proposals for detailed roadmaps, including precise timetables and increased pre-accession assistance, in order to take the accession process forward. As you know, these two countries have proposed 2007 as their target date for accession and the Commission believes no effort must be spared to achieve that target.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a word about Turkey. This House has already had occasion to debate the issue at length. For my part, I want to state our position once more, in particular in the light of contacts Commissioner Verheugen and I have had recently with the leader of the AKP, Mr Erdogan. On the basis of the Helsinki Conclusions, the Commission regards Turkey as a candidate on an equal footing with other candidate countries, and therefore as subject to exactly the same assessment criteria. The report the Commission presented on Turkey in October was based on objective information that no one disputed. It noted Turkey's progress towards meeting the Copenhagen political criteria. It also noted the remaining difficulties. In short, Turkey has come a long way but much remains to be done. The new Turkish Government's legislative programme confirms this. Indeed, the government plans to present several series of legislative measures, and even constitutional amendments, to the Turkish parliament in order to bolster democracy and human rights in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must encourage this process. It is in our interest that a major partner such as Turkey, whose role is enormously important strategically, politically and economically, should reinforce its institutions, improve the quality of its democracy and commit itself unequivocally to the values and principles we all share. On the other hand, before we take an irreversible step, we must be sure that Turkey meets all the conditions fully, just as we have in the case of the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the prospect of approaching membership of the Union has given millions of Europeans a new political and economic perspective. Above all it has given them hope. Hope is the rarest and most valuable commodity in politics. History has not been kind to these peoples recently, but now they have the hope of a better future – a future of dignity, freedom and prosperity. I am certain that this hope will carry the Union forward for many years to come and that, together with the governments and peoples of the incoming Member States, we will achieve great things.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, changes and developments are now occurring on at least a daily, even an hourly, basis, and so the picture I can give you at the moment is only a snapshot of that moment. It prompts a number of observations on the subject of Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, we have not yet reached the objective. There are still very considerable differences in outlook between the Member States and the candidate countries, and any real result in Copenhagen will demand abundant political courage, far-sightedness, and a great deal of leadership. I am of course glad to hear it said that we are dealing here with an historic dimension, which must not be allowed to be brought down by this or that detail. Do you think I do not know that? But even great and historic projects have to be paid for, everything has to be done decently and in order, and we have to get through the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment. I am confident, though, that the Heads of State and Government will indeed weigh up the risks we would run if we did not achieve a result, and the concessions that might still be required in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important that Copenhagen should not be overloaded, and I am saying this to the future Member States, whom I earnestly urge to do their utmost to sort out the many bilateral issues and leftovers from the negotiations by the beginning of next week, which I think they have a very good chance of being able to do. But I am also addressing the Member States, who must resist the temptation to tie the great decision on enlargement to the advancement of certain national interests. It is with a certain amount of concern that I see the first attempts being made at wrapping up packages that are not appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have to achieve an outcome in which there are no winners or losers. Those who think in terms of winners and losers will fail. We have to achieve an outcome in which there are only winners, one in which the principal victor is Europe as a whole. So everyone should be aware that the proposal from the Presidency that is now on the table, which was worked out together with the Commission and is fully endorsed by it as it stands, is a fair and even-handed offer to the Member States. Although it is now the accession of ten states that we are now organising rather than the six planned in Berlin in 1999, the Danish proposal is over EUR 2 billion below the upper limit laid down in Berlin. This gives the candidate countries an argument when they ask how it is that it is suddenly no longer possible to make the funds available that, in 1999, were considered appropriate for six countries, even though we now have ten countries to deal with. That is an argument that is not easy to counter, and so I hope that there will be some movement here.</p>
<p class="contents">I really have to tell you that one problem is the result, quite simply, of the rules we have made for the European Union. The new Member States will have to pay full contributions from the very outset, but, as you know, the flow of funds is very slow, and it is subject to certain rules. Not only do we have the problem of having to prevent new members from becoming net contributors; we also have the additional problem that we may not allow the new Member States' state budgets to become unbalanced. It is that problem that we have at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just add, in conclusion, that the proposal currently under discussion has already taken on board many of the candidate countries' arguments and aspirations and contains many new ideas, the most important of which, in my view, is the creation of what is termed a Schengen facility, by which we will be supporting the new members in securing our external borders. I believe that what makes this idea so good is the fact that it will persuade the citizens that money is being spent here for a purpose that is of benefit to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Prodi has made reference to Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Turkey, I do not need to repeat what he said, but I do want to put forward a few ideas for your consideration. In the situation as it is at the moment, in which we are closer than we have been in decades to resolving the Cyprus problem, and there is a real opportunity to sort the problem out – an opportunity that will pass us by if it is not done before Copenhagen – at a moment such as this, positive, encouraging signs are of extraordinary importance. It would therefore be right and proper for the European institutions, even before Copenhagen, to speak out clearly in favour of the international community taking its share of responsibility in managing the great tasks that will remain to be dealt with after the Cyprus issue is resolved. This country will have great burdens laid upon it, burdens that it cannot bear alone, and it will be dependent on help from the international community. The sooner the international community declares its readiness to provide this aid, the greater, perhaps, will be the willingness to do as the United Nations proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, I believe that we can be satisfied with the position that we have reached. What we now need is a final great effort, an effort made in full awareness of the fact that time is running out. We have often spoken of a window of opportunity. I had no inkling of just how true that is. We must all be aware that if we do not act now, every month in which we hesitate will make things more and more difficult. I am firmly convinced that it would take only six months for the Budget situation in the Member States to make a solution almost impossible. So I can only say that it must be done now, and all parties must, in heart and mind, surmount the obstacles!</p>

The reason for this is that, contrary to what it had agreed with me, Turkish television has announced that Mr Watson and I will be available for a discussion starting at 5 p.m.. Not wishing to give the wrong political impression, I will go and do it, although I do not otherwise comply with requests of this sort if they have not been agreed in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn, though, to Copenhagen: from Copenhagen to Copenhagen! I wish the summit of Heads of State and Government under Danish presidency great success, in order that we may tackle the issues that remain to be resolved. This summit in Copenhagen must become a summit for enlargement. We must not end up in a situation in which Turkey is the sole topic for discussion. Turkey may well be important, but Copenhagen must send out a signal that the peoples of Central Europe, plus Malta and Cyprus, are joining the community of values that is the European Union. That must stand centre-stage. Copenhagen must consummate the historic process of the 1980s and 1990s, and, to that end, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we wish you much success!</p>
<p class="contents">I can endorse wholeheartedly what has been said on behalf of the Commission, both by President Prodi and by Commissioner Verheugen, both of whom, as well as the President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to thank for the work they have done. Speaking on behalf of our group, I would also like to remind you that, even if the Danish proposal is accepted, we still have EUR 2.391 billion in hand, on the assumption that the figure, to which Commissioner Verheugen referred, is correct. We should be counting every euro, and, as President Prodi will be aware, I am very much in favour of stability, but the outcome of Copenhagen must not be that the whole enlargement project is deferred for lack of agreement on the financial issues. We therefore call on the governments to achieve a result in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would think it a tragedy, ladies and gentlemen, if we ended up without an agreement with Poland, a country that was at the heart of change in Europe – I do not want to recapitulate the historical circumstances all over again; I have done it often enough – and if we ended up without an agreement with Poland, the country to which, along with others of course, we owe the great change in Europe. Hence the demand that the Heads of State and Government should do something now and make a result possible.</p>
<p class="contents">And now for Turkey. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Court of Justice is fifty years old today; at any rate, it was fifty years ago that it was convened for the first time, on 4 December 1952. The law matters to us. There are criteria for accession, and they include such things as the law. We cannot, then, take certain things – all of which are important but have nothing to do with the criteria as such – as reasons for now naming a date for negotiations with Turkey, even though the criteria have in no way been met! We firmly reject the idea that Copenhagen should name a date for negotiations!</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I say this in full awareness of the fact – which I do not conceal and have never sought to conceal – that there are within our group widely divergent views on whether or not Turkey should be a member. Some are very strongly in favour of Turkish membership, while others advocate a strategic or privileged partnership. This is indeed normal in a large group, and I am sure that other groups differ but little.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking only about Turkey, however, when we agree, absolutely and 100%, that it would breach our own requirements and be in contravention of them, if we were now to throw overboard what we have defined as conditions for the commencement of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">What will be the image of the European Union if pressure is exerted over the Cyprus issue, if we are told that, if there is no date right now, the Cyprus issue will not be resolved? We are becoming susceptible to extortion! I therefore recommend that we rely on the firm foundations of European law and criteria. The Commission has pointed us in the right direction; we are not opening any negotiations right now, because the criteria have not been fulfilled, and, on this, our group has no reservations whatever in following the Commission's lead.</p>
<p class="contents">What I expect of the Council Presidency, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that you too take your stand on the basis of the criteria and of what has hitherto been agreed in the Community of Fifteen. If you take a different line, our assessment of the Danish Presidency's achievements will be less favourable than it has been so far. Nor do we accept the way in which the United States of America is trying to exert influence; whilst they have the right to bring influence to bear, it is influence and pressure to which we shall not yield! Now, I am also aware that there are countries in the European Union that lag behind others; in particular, that there is a major EU country that needs to make up for lost time in its solidarity with America, and this country is therefore susceptible to pressure. For us, as a friend and partner of America, the pressure of no consequence whatever, as we are following our own principles, and so what we say to our American partners and friends is this: You can make recommendations to us, but we will act in accordance with our own convictions!</p>
<p class="contents">We now hear from Turkey that the Cyprus issue will not be resolved if they are not given a date. We had a clear basis, to which the President-in-Office of the Council referred: if the Cyprus issue is not resolved within the framework of a federation of both parts of the island, then what had previously been resolved by the European Union will apply, and the whole island – but in reality only its Greek part – will become a member.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one further comment to make to the Commission on the post-1 May 2004 order. Our recommendation to the Council and to the Commission is that no decision, whether anticipatory or otherwise, should be taken without reference to Parliament. We are prepared to be flexible in any way that will be appropriate, but what you can depend on is that we will always defend Parliament's rights. It is on this basis that we seek good cooperation with all the institutions of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">We are on the eve of an important historical event: the reunification of Europe, rather than the conclusion of a new stage in enlargement, of which this is the fifth. I believe we must wish the Danish Presidency luck in its task since this is a very important moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Vice-President Titley and other colleagues from my group will deal with all aspects of this issue. I will restrict myself to thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, for his reference to my question from the previous plenary session, specifically in relation to the institutional aspects and their relevance to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I consider the behaviour over recent weeks of the Commission and the Council in relation to issues which are not only subject to negotiation with the enlargement countries, but which affect our daily life and the essence of Parliament, to be entirely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I still maintain that criticism. I have listened carefully to President-in-Office Haarder and President Prodi. I am grateful and pleased that you are coming on the 10 December to Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but I maintain my criticism for the following reasons: firstly, it has been proposed to modify the mandate of the Commission; I have always thought, and we have therefore always advocated, that the Commission should be chosen, that from the day of the European elections the Commission should be operational. It was said that its mandate would last until January and now it turns out that the date for the end of the Commission’s operations is being brought forward. It is never made to coincide with the elections, which worries me very much.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the General Affairs Council of 18 November took a series of decisions which affect many areas, specifically, the parliamentary timetable for 2004, and which make this Parliament during the next legislature a concertina Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have Members who are here for just a month, and then we will have the incorporation of other Members from the candidate countries who will have joined the Union. Then, if the negotiations with Rumania and Bulgaria are concluded at the same time, there will be another modification; if it is not at the same time, there will be two modifications. In other words, we will not know what the absolute majority in this Parliament is nor what its membership will be over the next legislature. This has not therefore been done well and it causes many problems. Furthermore, I do not believe it makes any sense to have Commissioners spending several months with nothing to do in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament must defend its right to hold hearings and to appoint a Commission on the basis of a joint programme and that is our duty to the electors. I hoped that in the ‘trialogue’, as President Prodi said, there would be progress on this issue. But, Mr President, since there has been no information from you, I very much fear that there has been no progress in last week’s ‘trialogue’; if I am mistaken, please tell me now. And I would ask you please, and we are awaiting the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of 10 December, to raise these issues seriously at the European Council in Copenhagen, because this is not the way to act.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, and I will end here, I still have hope because, as Alfonso X the Wise, a philosopher king, said, ‘if God had consulted me on the day of the Creation, I would have given him some useful advice’. Neither the Council nor the Commission are God, and neither are we the Devil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that enlargement will make us more multi-cultural and more competitive. The central question is: will it also make us more democratic?</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the answers to that question are being teased out inside the Convention, but it is certainly up to the European Council and not the president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, to decide just how far and how fast Member States are prepared to project the Union's experience in parliamentary democracy to the east and the south. I trust that the European Council and the Commission will be generous to Turkey in this respect. We should throw ourselves behind the process of regime change which is taking place in Turkey. There would be no stronger way of expressing support for Turkey's reformers than offering a schedule for the opening of the accession negotiations but only on the condition that the Turkish Cypriots were brought to accept the Annan proposals for a federated settlement of the problem of Cyprus. It will certainly be far more possible for them to accept a UN settlement should there be a firm prospect of membership for motherland Turkey itself. They frankly require the assurance of our settled intentions concerning our future partnership with Turkey and I know that the presidency will do all that it can to achieve this great breakthrough that is in its grasp. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to commend the Danish Presidency for managing to secure the release of Akhmed Zakayev before the great Copenhagen Summit gets under way. It was a splendid decision and means that many of my worst fears have fortunately not come true. I also wish to praise the Presidency for its hard work on enlargement. I think, however, that it is worth remembering that praise is also due to the applicant countries for the herculean task of adapting themselves, and for the formidable tasks the populations of these countries have had to undertake in connection with this whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to point out, as Mr Verheugen did, that it is not over yet. Besides the fact that we have not quite completed the whole project, the people of these countries will of course also be voting on whether or not they want to join us. In this connection, it is to be hoped that these voters do not compare the debate on money with the debate we had earlier today, the one about all the money – the large amounts of euros – that, for various reasons, the Commission has not been able to use. I hope that the citizens of the applicant countries do not look at the two things side by side and become frustrated. I hope for a ‘yes’ vote.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkey, I also agree that the time has not yet come to give that country a date, but I think that the right thing to do would be to give it a date for a date; in other words, set a combination of a timetable and a roadmap. What are the practical demands we are making of them? What are the deadlines? How are they to be met? When must the individual parts of the human rights and democracy projects be implemented in Turkey in order that we can set the final date? It is obvious that it is not possible to give a fixed date right now, with fundamental aspects still not in place and many decisions yet to be implemented. A date for a date, however, would be the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a couple of things, however, that have disappointed me about the Danish Presidency. I am disappointed that it did not manage to do something about the Statute of the Ombudsman. I am disappointed that it is still not possible for the Ombudsman to obtain the documents he asks for. Not only to be permitted to sit down somewhere and read them, but also to have those documents handed over which he has asked for, and which he needs in order to carry out his work. I am also disappointed that no progress was made towards ensuring that the employees who are in contact with the Ombudsman are only bound by one thing, that is, by the truth, rather than by any form of loyalty to one of the institutions of the EU. These employees must be bound by the truth in order to ensure the proper treatment of citizens within this system, and tackling this was one of Denmark’s clear priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also disappointed with Denmark’s readiness to cooperate with the USA in connection with the war with Iraq, and also in relation to the EU’s list of terrorist organisations. I should like to hear where the Presidency stands on the plans to put the Iranian resistance movement on the list of terrorist organisations. Does this not conflict with what Denmark, amongst others, supported when the list of terrorist organisations was first discussed, which was that resistance movements comparable with the ANC or the Danish resistance movement must under no circumstances end up on the list of terrorist organisations? We have a problem, and I should like to hear the views of the Danish Presidency on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us repeat ourselves, therefore, although it may be that, for once, it will not be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to the timetable, I would like to say one very simple thing: the Commission, the Council and Parliament must come to an agreement together. It is unacceptable for the Council to set one timetable and for the Commission to set another. We must reach an interinstitutional agreement. Once this agreement has been reached, it is up to Members of Parliament to come to an agreement, because different points of view coexist within this House. I am against the idea of bringing forward the elections, against decisions which would not change anything in terms of historic opportunities and could lead us, in my view, to speed things up, leading us inevitably to failure. We must find an interim solution for the new commissioners during the six-month period. I think that the most important thing, and no one has mentioned this, is that, if the Convention succeeds – and I hope it will – in convincing everyone that the President of the Commission must be elected by Parliament, and if the IGC accepts this, I shall, in that case, call on the Council to bring forward the ratification, because this procedure could take 18 months otherwise. As things stand, the next Commission will not be able to be elected under this procedure, simply because we will not have enough time for the IGC to endorse the appointments. It is therefore absolutely essential that the Council anticipates and accepts what has been decided by the Convention and by the IGC, and therefore that, when the next Commission is constituted, and this is the most important thing in my eyes, the next President is elected by Parliament, thus anticipating what is decided by the Convention and the IGC. That is the most important thing.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey is concerned, we must be responsible. We cannot decide on Turkey’s accession plan now. There are some possibilities of Turkey joining the EU, but there are also some arguments against its accession. What we must say today, therefore, is ‘no’ to those who say that Turkey is not part of Europe, and ‘no’ as well to those in the US and the UK who tell us that Turkey must at all costs be part of Europe. President Clinton had even said that Russia should definitely be part of Europe. So we say to the US that Mexico and Canada must be part of the United States. How about that? I do not understand why it is up to the US to decide who must be part of Europe. I believe, therefore, that this question remains open. There are important debates to be held, but I call on the President of Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council to write a letter to the Turkish Government and tell it, in order to give it the opportunity to prove his good intentions, that we are organising a meeting in Strasbourg for all the Sakharov Prize winners, and that, in the light of this meeting, Leila Zana must be freed in order to be able to take part. It would be an extraordinary manifestation of Turkey’s goodwill. This is what can be done in the near future, Mr President. Therefore, Mr President, write to the Turkish Government. It would certainly be an extraordinary gesture before Copenhagen if the Turkish Government allowed Mrs Zana to come to the meeting of all the Sakharov Prize winners. This is how we could move things forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by simply repeating exactly what I always say: financially, our proposals for enlargement will not be enough, not by a long shot. The Council is wrong, the Commission is wrong. We cannot operate on the same budget with 25 Member States as we did with 15. <span class="italic">Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam</span>. We always have to repeat the same thing. One day, you will understand history and the meaning of history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The groundwork has been done and I commend you, Mr President, for your leadership and enthusiasm for the European project and also the Commission and the Danish presidency for their efficiency in dealing with this unprecedented project.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement to welcome ten new States and tens of millions of new European citizens into the EU is both a bold gesture and the accomplishment of our true European destiny. I urge the heads of State and Governments to be similarly bold in proposing a package of measures for Bulgaria and Romania that will ensure that those States too may fully rejoin the European family of nations as early as possible. I also hope that a genuine and significant decision will be made in relation to the Turkish application for membership. It is clear that Turkey has a key role to play in shaping the European Union of the future and we must do all in our power to guarantee that the new Turkish Government is given full support and encouragement in its desire to make their country meet the Copenhagen criteria so as to begin accession negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ten countries will be able to join the EU from 2004, two countries from 2007, and Turkey will probably be given a date for its next meeting. Europe is growing together, which is a good thing. However, the EU membership that is now being negotiated is not the kind the applicant countries will actually receive. They can say ‘yes’ to the EU, but as early as next Christmas, when the Rome Summit has buried the Treaty of Rome and the constitution of Rome is born, they will be given the status of constituent state of a new federal state. The completion of the new constitution is planned for before the new countries join, with their right of veto in matters of treaty amendments. This is unfair, as Mr Haarder also said.</p>
<p class="contents">When the applicant countries have signed their membership agreements, and when they have been approved here in Parliament – by March or April – they should be offered equal status with the present Member States and enjoy the same legal representation in all bodies. If a referendum says ‘no’ to membership, the country’s representation can cease in the same way as when Norway voted ‘no’ to EC membership and had to find an ambassador job for its Commissioner. If the referendums confirm membership, this membership becomes a reality, and the countries should have the same right of veto in matters of treaty amendments as the present Member States. They must not join as second-class members, but instead have equal rights from day one.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we could be much more accommodating with regard to the funding of their membership of the EU. When Denmark, a rich country, joined in 1973, we actually only paid 20% of our contribution in the first year, 40% the next, 60% the third and 80% the fourth, until, after five years, we reached our full contribution. Why can we not adopt a similar introductory arrangement with reduced contributions, or grant exemption from contributions, while these countries are so far behind us in terms of wealth? We should bear in mind that EC and EU membership is, of course, not just something one receives. For some it is actually very expensive insurance, as ordinary people have to pay contributions via their daily purchases of everyday goods and via national taxation. Everyone has to pay, but only very few receive subsidies from the EU budget. We should perhaps now look into redistribution, or Mr Rasmussen runs the risk of getting an unpleasant surprise when people realise how much they will have to pay in contributions to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few words about the next point on the agenda. There should be a move towards wages being paid through the front door, and being taxed in the Member States; and the system of travel expenses should be changed to a card system for Members, according to which Parliament pays all the expenses incurred, whatever their magnitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a communist activist, he was elected to uphold the need to stop Denmark acceding to Europe. Over 20 years on, you have heard what our dear Mr Bonde has to say about the management of the situation before us. In 1979, Mr Cohn-Bendit was probably still much more revolutionary than we are as European federalists, persistently liberal, persistently anti-fascist, anti-communist, anti-fundamentalist and federalist. Today, things have changed. Today, Mr Cohn-Bendit said something very interesting, but he presented it as a paradox. The United States is proposing that we speed up the time frames for Turkey’s entry into Europe. Mr Cohn-Bendit says that it is as if we were to call upon the United States to speed up their federalising process and get on with annexing Canada and Mexico. Is the concern today not the need to move towards a world organisation of democracy and democracies, using the ultimate global free liberal weapon of mass attraction in preference to the ultimate weapons of mass destruction? The ultimate free, liberal weapon of mass attraction is the recognition of the natural, historically-won right of every woman and every man to political democracy, to the rule of law and, therefore, to the liberal foundations of federal, federalist States which respect the freedom of the individual citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">What has all this got to do with Copenhagen? A great deal! After the war, Benedetto Croce observed that, indeed, monarchic Europe – the Scandinavian monarchies, the British monarchy, the Dutch and Belgian monarchies, as it were – was the only part of Europe which resisted the different forms of nationalism, including national socialism, and the different forms of socialism, including communism, preserving a faint hope of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">This story is paradoxical. The paradox which we want to focus on, Presidents, is that you are not free to build Europe in Copenhagen now: you are representing bureaucratised States and a bureaucratised Parliament. This means that the creative spirit is not free to flow where it will. We must fight for freedom and for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These implications, starting with the initial time frames, warrant a great deal of attention in our view, and they must be addressed with all due rigour. We cannot afford not to carry out a meticulous analysis with the excuse that these are political issues and that we therefore ought not to go into too much detail or that these are technical issues and it is not worth wasting time on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The solutions must be sustainable, respect the Treaties, meet a number of institutional criteria and be decided upon by agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, whereas the Council communication of 21 November sought to present us with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>. The Presidency representative, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, said that it is important for Parliament to be involved, but a debate – although the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has called for a debate – is not enough: a genuine, formal agreement needs to be reached between the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will, however, specify the points which we consider to be essential. Firstly, we believe that transitional arrangements relating to the composition of both the Commission and the European Parliament must be kept to a minimum or avoided. The Council has specified the date of 1 May 2004 for the formal entry into the Union of the new Member States. That would mean the appointment of ten new Commissioners, taking the total number of Commissioners up to 30, and would clearly create problems, in that the Commission’s term of office should end on 20 January 2005 at the latest. What responsibilities, what special status could be conferred upon ten Commissioners for a few short months, ten Commissioners which the European Parliament would not have time to examine at the necessary hearings in May before its dissolution? We would have Commissioners whose appointment had not been approved, whose role in the Commission was uncertain and who would be in danger of not having their appointments renewed a few months thence. I do not believe that this can be in the interests of the candidate countries of the future Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, joining the European Parliament after 1 May, the representatives of the new Member States would only be in office for a few weeks, for a single part-session, before the election of the new Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, if we stick to the date of 1 May 2004, the most sensible solution would appear to be to bring the European Parliament elections forward and schedule them for that same month of May. The President-in-Office has told us that such attempts have failed in the past. We do not see why they should fail again and we feel that an effort must be made to adopt that solution. In particular, the European Parliament elections – why should they not be held on 9 May 2004, immediately after the accession of the new Member States – would assume particular importance and this might stimulate greater, more enthusiastic participation of the electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it would allow us to carry out the election – if the Commission President is to be appointed by election, as we too hope – or, in any case, the vote on the appointment of the President of the Commission, during the June part-session of the European Parliament and to complete the process of examining the Members of the Commission and endorsing their appointment by the end of July, with the new Commission taking office on 1 August, without the need for dubious transitional measures and with all the Commissioners having full legitimacy and equal status.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, a decision needs to be taken to bring forward the end of the Commission’s mandate. The result would be first and foremost – and we believe this too to be vital – to synchronise essentially the terms of office of the Commission and the European Parliament. To this end, we need an interinstitutional agreement which brings forward the end of the Commission’s term of office and the date of the European Parliament elections, and we call strongly for such an interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment on the subject of the IGC. Mr Haarder, you said that the future new Member States must also be able to exercise the right of veto at the Intergovernmental Conference, in other words they must have exactly the same rights as the Member States without actually being Member States, only acquiring this status as of 1 May 2004. We would like to know how this tallies with Article 48 of the Treaty. We believe that an acceptable solution would be for them to have the same status for the purposes of the IGC that they have for the purposes of the Convention.</p>

I should like to say that we are currently facing an historic moment. Indeed, we are at the final stage of negotiations and I think that the package that is being prepared by the Danish Presidency, consisting of a number of key components on the subjects of agriculture, nuclear safety and border control, is, of course, one that is certain to appeal to our citizens in the European Union as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no option but to conclude from the Commission report that the Member States wishing to accede still have to sort out an awful lot of things. I also think that we should expressly mention this in Copenhagen, so that our citizens know what the newly-acceding Member States are up against in the coming year and a half. Another area of concern to which more attention should be given is media pluralism in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The past has shown us all that, let us say, the old establishment set aside resources and created opportunities in order to keep their own media intact. In this area too, I think we could ask the Commission to devote more attention to the actual – that is the factual rather than theoretical – diversity of the media in Central and Eastern European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we should not combine enlargement with the debate on Turkey. If we do engage in such a discussion at present, we would of course be flouting our own laws and rules, as Mr Poettering has already pointed out. Looking at the facts and the Commission's report – and I was in this respect pleased with Commissioner Verheugen's speech – we simply have to conclude that although Turkey has made a great deal of progress, it still fails to meet the Copenhagen criteria on all counts. This is why we are, actually, in a kind of virtual debate and are doing silly things to boot. We like to mention a date for the sake of naming the date. Good luck to anyone who can explain this to citizens in the European Union. I am therefore in favour of abandoning this curious debate. We cannot get away from Turkey's need to meet the Copenhagen criteria, and the fact that it does not do so at the moment. Consequently, we should stop wasting any more time on this. Imagine if Member States were to set dates at this stage which are at the moment not based on fact.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of agriculture, there is something that is still a factor for me, namely the huge differences existing between the new acceding countries, between Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary for example. I wonder whether we should not concentrate on making the package more tailor-made. The Danish Presidency has set a good example in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely, farming in Poland with less than one and a half acres is mainly a social problem, one that should be dealt with in Poland, and the European Union might well be able to play a major role in this. Farmers with up to 8, 9, 10 hectares will mainly need help in the form of world development programmes, which is quite different from extensive discussions about quotas and so on, as these mainly apply to the far bigger agricultural areas in Poland. I would therefore call for more attention to be given to this area, and it would surely be extremely sad if Poland and the Polish Government were to be prevented from striking an agreement simply by our inability to offer a somewhat more targeted programme and, above all, to allow the Polish Government to develop a somewhat more targeted programme for their own farmers. I would therefore urge some sort of creativity in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the new Member States, everyone is agreed, of course, that we need to set up a system where there is no room for net contributors. However, we should also consider how we can speed up the cash flow so that these Member States do not end up having major problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying this: we have an enormous opportunity in Copenhagen, and we should seize it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I warned that we should not celebrate prematurely the end of this process because there was still a long way to go and of course I was right. It now seems that although we think we are close to agreement, we are actually a long way from agreement and there is a very real prospect that we could lose everything. We should be clear on that.</p>
<p class="contents">If Copenhagen ends up with endless rows over highly technical issues conducted in ten parallel negotiation sessions, it does not take a brain surgeon to realise the whole process could easily seize up. For once, I disagree with Commissioner Verheugen. I think if we miss Copenhagen, we will not miss it for a week or a month or a couple of months, we will miss enlargement for a whole generation. As I have said before and I will say it again, it is now or never. This is the opportunity we have to seize.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the brave attempt by the Danish presidency to put an extra EUR 1 billion on the table in order to clear the decks so we do not have these complicated negotiations in Copenhagen. Unfortunately, in doing so, particularly a couple of weeks in advance, they seem only to have encouraged some of the applicant States to believe that this is just one more stage in the negotiations and quite frankly we have to be clear that it is not. This is not a constantly elastic process. At some point we must say no. Berlin and Brussels cannot be breached. The moment we break budget discipline, we open a whole Pandora's box which is liable to bring the whole project collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We also must be clear that this project is so important that we are not prepared to let any one country sabotage the whole negotiations. If any one country wants to hold out until the last possible moment, they do so at their own risk and not at the risk of all the other accession countries, because we must be prepared to agree as each country is prepared to agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, I must urge our leaders to ask themselves a simple question before they go to Copenhagen. What will they do in 20 years' time when they are sitting with their grandchildren on their knees and their grandchildren say: ‘What was your real role in the great disaster when Europe failed to grasp its own destiny? What did you actually do?’ Are they really going to turn around and say: ‘Well, actually, we could not do it because we were not sure if Baltic sprats were big enough for our nets. We could not do it because we could not quite agree on the right amount of sheep premium or the exact sugar quota or exactly what sort of portfolio a Commissioner should have for two months’? Are we really going to say that? Because it is going to sound very lame. Let us think of the big picture and remember that the money we are giving to the accession countries represents one thousandth of the GDP of the European Union. The entire EU budget is only two thirds of what the British Government spends on social security alone. We are actually talking about what are minor issues in the global picture of things. Let us not lose sight of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Turkey, I would say that we must say to this new government, which is like a breath of fresh air in my opinion: you must meet the Copenhagen criteria. We want you to meet it by such and such a date and if you do we will open negotiations. But let us kill off once and for all this idea that Europe is a Christian project only. I represent Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Buddhists, Taoists, all religions, and I am not prepared to say to them: ‘The European Union is not for you’. This is the message some people in this chamber are giving out and we must kill that off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the European Union, solidarity stops when it comes to money.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency may well have tried, by means of its negotiating package, to do justice to all positions, but, as the spirit of integration was shown the door, all that has come out is a worthless patchwork of rags that is no kind of framework for a future together. Why is this? The Member States' mean-minded attitude leaves the candidate countries with the impression that they are second-class citizens who are not welcome. That puts wind in the sails of the EU's opponents in those countries, and jeopardises its acceptance. Savings in the Structural Funds mean savings in cohesion, in the very heart of the European Union, and thus have adverse effects on the project of integration. Hence the impossibility of significant impetus for rural development or an attempt at it, the most devastating indication of which is the fact that it will lose out when grants of aid are increased. This is an attempt at making manifest the structures of an agricultural policy that has failed in the European Union, and, in practical terms, an indirect rejection of agricultural reform, meaning that the demise of farms in the candidate countries is being pre-planned without there being any alternative jobs. That is sending the wrong signal. We, the Group of the Greens, reject all attempts at downgrading enlargement into a national savings bank, and hereby demand that the Council and the Commission should give absolute priority to the project of support for rural areas in the candidate countries and allocate more funds to it. Without that, the result will be social collapse, the European Union's spirit will be endangered and so will the project for EU reform! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It will be necessary to iron out a few last-minute financial difficulties, but we have great hopes and we particularly welcome the fact that France is willing to look at the latest proposals by the Danish Presidency in a favourable light. They certainly demand some additional expenditure, but what is at stake is worth the effort and we must not forget that the Brussels European Council of last October had taken away almost an equivalent amount of structural aid from the new members. Everything should therefore balance out in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major item on the Copenhagen agenda will be Turkey’s candidacy. We share Mr Giscard d'Estaing’s view that, as things currently stand, Turkey’s accession would spell the end of the European Union. We have, in fact, said this several times before. The 1999 Helsinki European Council made a serious mistake, which has unfortunately not been made good, but has since been confirmed. This error on the part of the Union shows its lack of understanding of what it is and its ignorance of what it wants.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the European Parliament, you yourself have suggested that Mr Giscard d'Estaing, by adopting this position, would be removed from his role. I do not believe this, because exactly how could the Convention draft proposals on the future of the Union, on its institutions, on its policies if it has not firstly answered the following questions. What brings us together? What is our model for the Union for the next fifty years? Where must our borders end? Mr Giscard d'Estaing is therefore doing exactly the right thing by raising these questions indirectly. In fact, in our opinion, Mr President, the Convention, under whose influence I do not know, has been too hasty in preparing technical proposals without first having answered fundamental political questions which influence them. It is in Europe’s own interests to put things right as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nassauer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, the European Council in Copenhagen will decide to enlarge the European Union by adding to it eight countries of the former Eastern Bloc as well as Cyprus and Malta. This is the subject of negotiation and – necessarily – of occasional dispute, and haggling over one point or another, but nothing can conceal the fact that Europe, divided until 1989, is now, by taking this step, giving itself a new Community order, founded on the principle of democracy, the rule of law, freedom and the market economy. I am convinced that, of all the political events we have experienced, it is this one that will be the most important for all the generations now living.</p>
<p class="contents">If some far-sighted person fifteen years ago had written out the agenda for this European Council, as it now is, complete with the reunification of Europe, he would have been thought to be deluded! If, at that time, we had been asked about our willingness to pay another EUR 2.3 billion for it, I am sure that we would have answered with a loud, clear and instantaneous ‘yes’. Sustained effort will be demanded of us if this enlargement is to be managed – politically as well as financially, of that there is no doubt – but this is the moment when this Union of ours is joined by ancient European lands, which belong with us in exactly the same way as France and Great Britain do, and will join us in standing up for the principles of freedom and democracy under the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is founded on the applicability of the law, and it is the acknowledgement of the law's applicability that alone holds it together. That is why it is so significant that Parliament, in a resolution on the report on the negotiations with the Czech Republic, described the so-called Exemption Act as incompatible with our conception of law, and did so in a careful and balanced way. This question is not just about German-Czech relations in the past, but also about Europe's present and future, as fundamental principles of law and their applicability are at stake, and it would certainly be helpful if the Czech Republic were to say something to clarify matters before enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, my notes include a sentence, such as we have heard uttered so often already, to the effect that discussions on Turkey must not be allowed to dominate to some extent the enlargement summit, but I see that we ourselves have been unable to resist this temptation, so that may well be the way things are in Copenhagen as well, making it clear that this is something that people get worked up about. A few days ago, Commissioner Verheugen was quoted in a German newspaper as saying that he was against Turkey joining and that he proposed to the Turks the establishment of a special relationship as neighbours, a treaty that could also apply to other countries contiguous to the EU. I am sure, Commissioner Verheugen, that you will explain this as a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation and, quite rightly, point out that this represents a breach of the confidentiality you presumably agreed on. But this is not about you not being allowed to keep to yourself something that you want to have dealt with in confidence, but about the way this way of doing things encourages the impression that, on this issue, many are saying in public the opposite of what they actually think. Where Turkey is concerned, you would not be the only one, as a whole host of those who advocate its accession do not actually want it to join and are taking cover behind the criteria. That is a hypocritical way of going about things, and does more harm to the EU's relations with Turkey than it would to take stock of the situation with all the honesty that respect for this country requires. So, what we want is not offers of dates for accession, but greater honesty in our relations with Turkey!</p>

The Commission is right if it thinks that a range of difficult issues remain to be resolved, and we can be grateful to the Presidency of the Council for coming up with a number of proposals on them. Now if Mr Poettering believes that governments – by which he means the governments of the Member States – must now make the effort to come up with a solution, then I do indeed agree with him, but, on the other hand, I also want to make it clear that the same is true of the governments of the candidate countries. I know that Poland has a pain threshold. I have deep sympathy with Poland, and especially with its present government, but we too have pain thresholds, and I do think that both sides have to acknowledge the necessity of compromise in this area. Nor should the candidate countries fix the measuring rod so high up that it is no longer possible to jump over it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let us look at procedure and the institutional issues, in which the President-in-Office of the Council has described Parliament as having an interest. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have already spent some considerable time today discussing this in another context, and we are not dealing here with an interest, but with our rights and also with the Council's undertaking to talk to Parliament from the very outset. If it had done that, our situation would be an easier one. Mr Napolitano put forward a few arguments in favour of the procedure being changed at some points, and, much as I respect him, I am not convinced. My personal opinion is that every country, from the first day of membership, is entitled to a Commissioner, even if a Commissioner without portfolio. I take the view that, especially when there are ten new Commissioners, this House must also have the right of at least overall approval. Such overall approval could only, of course, be given with the involvement of the relevant nine new Member States, as it would be perverse for us to vote on a Polish Commissioner when the Polish MEPs were not allowed to.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings us, of course, to the detailed procedure for the new Parliament. I can see the legal arguments where the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, but I do agree with the proposal for its virtually full involvement, as, at the end of the day, these countries too have to vote on it and ratify it. One thing I ask of the President-in-Office of the Council: talk to the new candidates and negotiate with them! They are meant to be fully involved. Before you come to a decision, though, talk to us in this House, and then it will be easier for us to come up with a joint solution! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of us here are talking about EU unification. We are all talking about the historic decision in Copenhagen. Could the EU as a peace project be destroyed in Copenhagen, however? I am sure that many members will feel that this question is not relevant, but I think it is.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has been incredibly successful in bringing people and states closer together in the European Union. We now have, however, a candidate country which is first in line to become a member of the European Union, namely Cyprus. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nicosia has been Europe’s divided capital. Following the reunification of Germany, it is Cyprus which is the divided country in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has clearly stated that it would like to see the Turkish occupying forces withdrawn from northern Cyprus. In this situation, it is being discussed at a very high level in the Council whether Turkey should be given a date for a meeting where a new date for membership negotiations for this country would be set. I therefore turn particularly to the Danish Presidency and ask how will the public, how will the Cypriots and how will all of us together view this situation in which a country such as Turkey is to be given a date for starting membership negotiations while there are still 30 000 Turkish soldiers in northern Cyprus? Is this the EU as a peace project?</p>
<p class="contents">I would really like to dwell on this subject and wonder whether we can imagine a country negotiating with the European Union while at the same time unquestionably occupying 37% of another Member State. This must be investigated in Copenhagen. If it is conceivable that the EU, as a peace project, should permit Turkey to start negotiations without the Cyprus conflict being resolved, this means that a Member State can be occupied by a country seeking membership of the Union and actually negotiating with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see this question investigated. Let us not be blinded by the charm offensive on the part of Turkey. Let us look at the hard facts which say that one country, Cyprus, is on its way into the Union and another country which occupies 37% of that country wants to start negotiations. Is this reasonable? Is this the EU as a peace project? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course we recognise that new Member States have a right to a Commissioner as from day one of their membership of the European Union. Of course it makes sense not to reshuffle all the portfolios of the existing Commission just for a few months. Therefore it makes sense to curtail the mandate of the existing Commission and move rapidly to the approval of a new Commission by the new Parliament with the full democratic legitimacy that it entails. But how can this be done? Under the current Treaty, there are only two ways. One is that every single Member of the current Commission agrees to resign on an agreed date, or this Parliament adopts a motion of censure forcing them to resign. Both scenarios would be a little bit odd unless they were subject to an agreement among the three institutions. Another way would be for the Council to put it in the accession treaty but again if they were to do that unilaterally, without consensus and agreement, that would undermine the spirit of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">So what I think should happen is that we do negotiate and reach an agreement on what would be sensible, which would be to fix an early date for the Commission to be replaced, on condition that the new Commission has the full legitimacy of going through the full procedure by the new house to be elected in the European elections. That is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>. Under those circumstances, it would make sense, as has been suggested, to bring the date of the elections forward from June to May, because then the new house in June could already vote on the President and in July we could have the hearings and vote on the Commission as a whole, which could then begin, if that were agreed, already in August or September. That would allow us to go forward more speedily. It would get rid of the problems of Commissioners without portfolios for a lengthily period and it would make sense in its own right to have the elections early in May, which is a good idea on its own merits. By the way, Mr President, I am sure you would be interested in this, it would avoid us having the problems in this House of having full Members for one session only just prior to the European Elections. I think that is the route the Council should pursue in dialogue with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His surfeit of knowledge, though, means that his trains of thought travel by such circuitous routes that the actual message is lost. For the political message is that we want to give the candidates for accession a warm welcome without entangling them in bureaucratic minutiae! That, I believe, is what the message has to be. That is why we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, which is the lead committee on enlargement, have come up with other proposals, which are meant to be pragmatic and straightforward.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever we do – whether we prefer to elect the new Commission or think it even better that it should be appointed – there will still be a transitional period in which the new candidates will be entitled to cooperate with the present Commission in nominating Commissioners. Whether it be four weeks or four months, the principle remains the same and indissoluble. It is for this reason that I would simply say: let the Commissioners without portfolio come, as agreed, from 1 May onwards. Checks will be made on them as regards their competence, their financial independence and so on, and this will be done by a procedure that is not conducted in the committees, as they do not as yet have portfolios. The observers, who have been working with us for all of a year already, will simply become MEPs for four or eight weeks, as has always been our practice, and, with accessions, they have sometimes remained in that position even for a year, or for a year and a half. So what is the problem? I believe that the way to make headway here is to put this in simple terms. If the new Commission is to be in office by 1 November, then what is decisive is that Parliament's rights have to be secured. The appointment of the President of the Commission will follow the European elections so that these may have an influence on it, and so that we can have time to do what is necessary, by which I mean that the committees will be subjecting the candidates from the old and the new Member States to rigorous scrutiny to see if they are suited to the position. That, politically speaking, is what it is about, and that is what we have to take seriously, as is only right and proper.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make another, additional comment. I would like to express my gratitude to the Danish Presidency of the Council for having been able, while focussing their efforts on enlargement, to cooperate successfully with the Commission in guiding these enlargement negotiations to what is evidently a good result. The necessary compromises will have to be reached in a spirit of goodwill and will, of course – as Commissioner Verheugen so rightly said – have to be well-crafted, and I am sure that we will succeed in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion sparked off in connection with Turkey and the determination of a date has already demonstrated, in our sitting today, something that will be perpetuated in Copenhagen and subsequently in the media: no longer will anyone be rejoicing at our welcome for ten new countries; no longer will people be talking publicly about the accession of Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic; instead, Copenhagen will become a summit on Turkey, and Turkey will be our sole topic of discussion! I see it as inordinately regrettable that we have manoeuvred ourselves into this situation, a blackmail scenario in which we have ESDP and NATO, American pressure, Iraq and the Cyprus issue to cope with. I do not think it right that this situation should come about!</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Council is led by considerations of political logic – sometimes known in other places as opportunism – to decide to set a date, then I fear that the citizens of our Member States will say: aha, they are serious about this! Ten new countries, that is difficult enough, and then, along come the Turks! The ensuing discussion will create difficulties for us when it comes to selling Polish and Slovene accession to our public, and I hope that the Council is aware of this responsibility and is not thinking too much in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you will now appreciate, having heard one view from the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and an entirely different view from the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, it was not appropriate for me to seek a definitive conclusion in that dialogue other than to say that we needed to consult with the other institutions. Evidently we also need to talk to each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is crucial, of course, is that we welcome the Member States and that this House – soon to be newly elected – can codecide on the new President of the Commission, but that is where his and my line of reasoning part ways. I am pleased that he has mentioned 1 May as an important date, but I would say that this 1 May could, in fact, be the date for European elections, in which case I would be in Mr Napolitano’s camp.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to briefly update you on what has been happening in the Netherlands recently. There, we saw a Dutch Liberal leader, Mr Gerrit Zalm, launch a kamikaze campaign. He demanded that the Netherlands should thwart enlargement with a view to enforcing agricultural reforms. Fortunately, Mr Zalm has been sidelined for the time being, but with the forthcoming elections on 22 January 2003 in the Netherlands, he naturally remains a dangerous force to be reckoned with. The Dutch will hopefully elect a government that recognises the benefits of stability and economic growth, as well as the importance of a reunited Europe, thus preventing the Dutch reputation from being tarnished any further.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not detract in any way from the primary importance of those agricultural reforms to the enlargement countries, candidate countries, to us ourselves, and to the developing countries. And what is evident is that, thanks to Mr Fischler's proposals, we already have many sound proposals on the table, but that many Member States still threaten to obstruct them. What we need is the courage to do our homework in the area of agricultural reforms, and this is also necessary to help the dollar round succeed. Indeed, we may talk about a development round, but if no firmer and broader-based proposals benefiting agricultural reforms are tabled, then things will take a turn for the worse and this round will fail. In that case, we will not have done our homework, which is necessary if the accession countries are to be treated fairly. Mention is made of net and gross accounts between Europe and the enlargement countries too easily without sufficiently acknowledging the necessity of those agricultural reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I add that I hope that the discussions we are having here will somehow serve as a lesson to us in the next step towards enlargement by the accession of more countries? Let us have a less ambiguous and earlier debate with our electorates, and let us have the courage to ask for their opinions in good time by means of a European referendum. In my view, we have built in too much technocracy and not enough politics this time round. We have learnt that these are political decisions. We should summon up the courage to look our own people in the eye and accept their judgments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the</span> <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Thank you for another useful and constructive dialogue on enlargement. The debate confirms that there is massive support for what is happening next week. I would extend my thanks for all the good advice that has been given, on which I shall make a few comments. I should like to thank Mr Poettering for putting the Copenhagen European Council into exactly the right perspective from the outset. Without repeating what he said, it is this historical perspective that we must keep in view the whole time. The thanks given to the Presidency are also due to the Commission, especially Mr Verheugen, who has now been working tirelessly on this for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mr Titley. I do not know about ‘now or never’, but in any case it is time for action. It must succeed. Despite the difficult problems that remain, we have come so far that we cannot justify failure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Cyprus, I fully agree with Mr Verheugen. The EU and the international community must declare in plain terms their readiness to give the necessary assistance to meet the great challenges reunification will present to Cyprus and its two communities. We must do everything we can to ensure that the UN Secretary-General's endeavours to find a solution ahead of Copenhagen meet with success.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Turkey, the basis is clear. Turkey is a candidate. The accession negotiations can commence when the Copenhagen criteria have been met. They have not been, but Turkey has made impressive progress with the far-reaching reform package. In Copenhagen, a strong and positive signal will be sent to the Turkish politicians and population. The precise form this signal will take is to be discussed in detail by the Heads of State and Government. I agree with Mr Poettering that this is not the main subject for Copenhagen. The ten countries will take centre stage there. We shall not forget the prospect of Turkey, however, neither shall we forget Bulgaria and Romania. These two countries have made tremendous progress in their accession negotiations, but are not ready yet. They will be given a roadmap for the last stretch of the way.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the President of the Commission for his support for the content of the packages that the Presidency has presented to the ten countries, and I wish to thank Mr Verheugen for his word of caution against overloading the agenda for Copenhagen with all sorts of other issues. He knows better than anyone how difficult and complicated the enlargement process is, and he knows the danger of entering into detailed discussions on the individual packages at the Copenhagen Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks to the many people who have expressed their support for keeping within the expenditure ceilings set out at Berlin and Brussels. I also wish to thank all of those who have said that we should not argue over small amounts at this decisive historic juncture. I must, however, advise against suggestions that we should discuss whether we can add another couple of billions to the amount set out in the ten packages. The art is not to have opinions and make suggestions. The art is to gain a majority, to obtain everyone’s support, and there are, of course, countries who think that the packages put together by the Danish Presidency are already too generous. We must keep in mind that the art is to reach a consensus, or, in other words, to put the finishing touches to the packages in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo and others are right in saying that it would be best if the new countries had Commissioners with proper portfolios from the outset, and if Parliament could hold new elections in time to approve a new Commission. This would mean that the MEPs from the new Member States could play a part in approving the Commissioners from their countries. This is not as easy as it sounds, however. A new election date could help; and we <span class="italic">have</span> tried to arrange this, but without success. The Presidency is willing, but we are afraid that it will not be possible. If this is the case, it is good that we have another solution, one that may not be perfect, but is tolerable for all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Council has now stated – and in any case I have stated four or five times here in Parliament on behalf of the Council – that the new countries will be put on a completely equal footing with the old Member States at the Intergovernmental Conference, where a new treaty is to be adopted. This is not something I have made up; it is in Article 23 of the Treaty of Nice. It would be entirely unreasonable for us to offer the new countries, who are perhaps about to hold referendums, a different status from the old Member States, when their populations are to say ‘yes’ to a new treaty. In a way, it is bad enough that they have to accept a treaty that we are in the process of amending. If they are not placed on an even footing with us when the amended treaty is to be adopted, then I do not think that we are treating them properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to give my support to something that many have expressed. None of the applicant countries will have to wait for any of the others. If only nine applicant countries are ready, they will join. It is important, therefore, that the applicant countries, too, remember to strike while the iron is hot, or Mr Titley’s prediction might come true.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to say to the President that the Presidency looks forward to seeing him and the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen directly before the summit. There we can continue the dialogue we have had all along on these difficult but also rewarding issues that are common to the three institutions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, as this debate draws to a close I am pleased to be able to note once again that there is broad agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the question of enlargement, and that is an important political signal in itself. I would now like to say a brief word on the most important topics of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I will return to the subject of money. I think – no one will be surprised at this – that when we reach the final stage of a negotiating process that involves a lot of money people start to back pedal in public, and those who will have to pay start to say it is too much and those who want something say it is too little. That is quite normal and I would not get too excited about it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the structural question, however, which some Members of this House have quite rightly raised, that is: are our rules really designed to allow new members, who are poorer than the European Union’s present average, to gain from their membership in the first few years? That is precisely the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Lest anyone should be worrying for nothing, the position as I see it today is this: under the presidency’s proposal, the new Member States will receive more than EUR 9 thousand million net in actual payments in 2004, 2005 and 2006. So when their own contributions are deducted there are EUR 9 thousand million net additional payments left.</p>
<p class="contents">That means no one is a net payer and they are all in a much better position than in 2003. The figure for appropriations, ladies and gentlemen, is really very impressive, I have to say, and the word meanness is not appropriate. A net EUR 25.7 thousand million in appropriations are available for those three years. That is quite something when you look at the size of these countries’ economies. We should not forget that the gross national product of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is only five per cent of that of the present European Union. These figures are already reasonably balanced, I should say.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true, however, that it repeatedly has to be pointed out by both sides that the European Union is not a cash dispenser. You do not put a card, be it a membership card or a credit card, in at the top and get money out at the bottom. We are not like that at all. We are a community based on law and it is our aim that people should enjoy an equal standard of living, and we help to bring that about, but only in so far as we are actually able.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter has drawn attention to a particular matter, and unfortunately I have to agree with her, namely that this proposal that rural development funding should be made available for direct payments must actually be regretted from the Union’s point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that we put forward was in fact intended precisely to make possible a socially cushioned, sensible structural development of agriculture in the new Member States. I must however point out that it was quite a strong demand from the candidate countries themselves that they should be able to make a transfer, at least for the first three years. The argument is as simple as it is convincing: without this measure there is no chance of winning the referendum in Poland, for example. That is the background to this decision, but I readily admit that it is certainly regrettable from the point of view of a sensible development of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a brief word on the subject of Turkey. Mr Nassauer spoke to me about it in person. I have nothing different to say about it in private than I have said in public. What was quoted in the newspaper I have said many times, including here in the European Parliament. If, in 1999, we had had the opportunity to develop a Turkish strategy without the 40 years of past history we already had, it would never have occurred to me, at any rate, that the correct solution might be to offer Turkey full membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is, however, that we did not have that option. That option had already been attempted and had already failed and there was no other. I am sure that all the debates of the last few weeks, including those triggered by Mr Giscard d'Estaing, have not achieved the outcome that the former French president wanted. They have resulted precisely in those who would have preferred not to commit themselves at present – and there were quite a number who would have preferred not to do so – now being forced to endorse the outcome of Helsinki once again, namely that Turkey clearly has candidate status, that it will be treated like any other candidate, that its prospects for membership are unqualified and clear and that it is encouraged to continue down that road. That is the outcome of the debate in 15 Member States, so far as the governments are concerned. I am well aware that other views are being taken in public, sometimes even by the majority. But we know that the 15 governments of the Member States are unanimous in the view that we must stick to the Helsinki strategy. In that respect, Mr Giscard d'Estaing’s contribution probably did not have the outcome he wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate about dates, I agree with Mr Brok that we must not allow the subject of Turkey to eclipse the decision-making process about ratification in the Member States, and there is probably already a real danger that it will.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the institutional questions, the Commission is of course more than willing to enter into intensive discussions here at any time, and as always the Commission will not have the slightest problem; on the contrary, it will seek to ensure that Parliament’s rights are fully safeguarded. I should just like to make two small points.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we now needed a working hypothesis for the accessions. Without a date we would have been unable to negotiate the financial chapter, because the date has enormous consequences for the financial situation in the first year of membership. The financial packages for each individual country are quite different, depending on the date taken as a basis for the work. That is why the decision was necessary. So far as I know, it was taken by the Council primarily in the light of the amount of time the Member States said they needed for ratification. That should also be taken into account, as I have often said.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the Commission is concerned, I would like to point out once again that it suggested avoiding the transitional Commission with 30 commissioners and therefore offered to cut its term of office short, but it proved impossible to negotiate this. Candidate countries and Member States took the view that the new commissioners must be there from the first day of accession. In that case, I think it is sensible to keep this transitional period with 30 commissioners as short as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the date of 1 November emerged for the next Commission. That is the minimum amount of time required to appoint a new Commission President, get him approved and also to give him time to put a new Commission together. That is the full background. I think we can discuss it together sensibly and, as I said, the Commission is willing to do so at any time.</p>

This presupposes more say for the directly elected European Parliament, but also more of a Union in which peoples and regions feel at home.</p>
<p class="contents">All future Member States have made huge efforts to meet the Copenhagen criteria and to integrate the <span class="italic">acquis</span> into their legislation and national fabrics. Turkey cannot demand a date in Copenhagen. It is obvious that Turkey itself has a long way to go before it can meet the Copenhagen criteria. Surely it is up to Turkey to decide what it must, can, and is willing to do to become a true democracy, respecting human rights and cultural minorities. This should not only be evident from its legislation but also be based on reality. This does not only depend on the Turkish Government or parliament but, above all, on the attitude of the army, and as long as the army holds such a key position, Turkey cannot be considered a democracy in the true sense of the word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
