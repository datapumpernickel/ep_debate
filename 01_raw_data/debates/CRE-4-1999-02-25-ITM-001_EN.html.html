<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Donnelly, Alan </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, this is an extremely important issue for the business community and for citizens within the European Union. Individual citizens own many products. They travel by different forms of transport. They use public utilities. All of these will be affected by the computer problem associated with the year 2000. While some months ago many members of the public believed that this was a problem only for computer companies, it is now very clear that the issue of the millennium bug will affect all citizens in every aspect of their lives. The most important thing for the European Union to do in the course of this year is to make sure that all social groups and every part of the business community are made fully aware of the potential complications of the millennium bug.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less concerned about the way in which major multinationals are preparing to deal with this issue. It is pretty clear that if you are a major multinational you can afford and probably have had experts working on this issue for several years. But we know that within the European Union there are approximately 18 million small enterprises. How many of those have identified whether or not they have potential problems after 1 January 2000 because of systems they are operating within that small business?</p>
<p class="contents">In some countries – my own included – several thousand experts have been appointed to go round and help the small business community to identify whether a small business will be affected. But across the whole of the European Union, given the importance of the small business community to the EU, we need to make sure that as much pressure as possible is exerted on the Member States to provide the same facility in all 15 countries. I would be very grateful if the Commissioner could explain to us this morning whether there is any surveillance programme to identify whether all 15 Member States are providing expertise to help in advising the small business community on how the millennium bug could affect them.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to public utilities – electricity, gas, water and so forth – it is essential that they too manage their own affairs in relation to the millennium bug. It would be disastrous for citizens in the European Union if, because of inadequate preparation, the public sector and the public utilities found they had problems after 1 January 2000. What measures are being taken across the European Union to have a coordinated response and to ensure that proper information is going to the public services in this area?</p>
<p class="contents">As far as European Union legislation is concerned, there is a body of legislation dealing with liability for defective services, product safety and other liability legislation. What is not clear to me is whether we will be applying those product liability directives to any problem that might occur in relation to the millennium bug. In the United States, for example, they have considered waiving liability legislation so that companies are not affected by the failure of their products or services. Will European citizens be able to call upon product liability and defective services liability legislation in the European Union in the event of goods or services not operating as a result of the millennium bug? This is a matter people in the European Union want answers to. Can they resort to law if they find they have problems?</p>
<p class="contents">There are two final points I want to deal with. What contingency plans are Member States making and what collective initiatives are taking place across the European Union in the event – God forbid – of a serious problem associated with a major industry within the EU? What action is being taken by the civil authorities to prepare for a potential disaster in one or another part of the EU? For example, are the Interior Ministers discussing whether or not there needs to be a contingency plan for 1 January 2000? Some people may say that this is a Cassandra trying to paint a very black picture but the fact is that we do not know whether there are potentially very disastrous problems waiting round the corner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to our external relations. Around our borders we have relations with the Eastern European countries and with the former Soviet countries. They have extensive nuclear installations which we know are already in a very serious state of decline. What work is being done by the European Union to secure these nuclear installations and other major utilities around our borders against potential disaster because of a lack of preparation by these other countries? This is not just a European Union problem but could have very serious implications, in particular in very sensitive sectors such as the energy sector, unless we make proper preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is critically important to us. It is not only computer buffs who should be concerned. It is for every citizen to recognise the danger to their own livelihood and risks to our safety. The Commission and the Parliament must make it very clear that we will push throughout this year to guarantee that all steps that can be taken are taken to secure the safety of our citizens, to secure the legal rights of our citizens and to secure the prospects for our business community, together with the safety of our neighbours at this very critical time, as a result of the changes in technology.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hendrick </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating my good friend and colleague Mr Donnelly on an excellent report which covers most aspects of the problems associated with the millennium bug. This report has not come too soon – rumours of it being on the agenda of the December part‐session are unfounded!</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, estimates are that the millennium bug problems could cost up to 2 % of GDP. Given that growth in many countries is estimated at below 2 %, this is a very unsatisfactory position and everything should be done to try to minimise the impact of the problem, in particular with regard to public services, business, transport, domestic problems and, as Mr Donnelly mentioned, the threat to safety. The most worrying of all is nuclear safety and we know that there are problems in Central and Eastern Europe and possibly elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address three areas which give cause for concern. These are public awareness, liability in the case of failure and, thirdly, the issue we have touched on, namely safety. In terms of public awareness, I know that there are programmes in each Member State to give information to consumers in particular, but also businesses. I would call on the Commission to use the European Information Centres to distribute information to ensure that the public and businesses are aware of their responsibilities and the risks involved in not preparing for the year 2000. Business awareness is a problem for the reasons I have outlined and its effects on economic performance. The wait‐and‐see attitude which some businesses are adopting is unsatisfactory. The situation could be far worse than they could possibly imagine.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of liability in the case of failure, consumers should be protected. The present position of whether it is unavoidable failure or unforeseen is inadequate. Many insurers are trying to shirk their responsibilities. Consumers should be insured on the basis that it is reasonable for the consumer to expect recompense, given the age of a particular product.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on safety. Obviously, the nuclear industry is an area of concern – and Mr Donnelly touched on this. Transport is another. All attempts should be made to build in fail‐safe measures where there are doubts about the proper functioning of equipment after the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this report to the House and congratulate Mr Donnelly again.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Velzen, W.G. </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate Alan Donnelly very warmly on this first‐rate report. I think he gives an excellent answer to all the questions of concern to the European Union here. It is not his fault that the report is late, it is just one of those things. It looks as if the European Union is reluctant to shoulder its responsibilities in this area, and I should like to put the following question to Commissioner Bangemann. At one of the meetings of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, he said that the millennium problem was not really all that serious. We would find in the year 2000 that it had all been ‘hype" on the part of the software manufacturers. What I actually want to ask him is how seriously does he now think we need to address the millennium problem at European Union level? I will focus on four points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the problem of ‘chain reactions". We all know that you cannot solve the millennium problem at local, regional or national level alone, you have to look too at the EU dimension as a whole. But obviously all these things are closely interrelated. The better we are able to map and resolve the problem of potential chain reactions, the more successful we shall be in tackling the millennium problem. From the point of view of the internal market, I therefore think it is most important that we pay attention to what develops with regard to potential chain reactions in this area and at European Union level. The example of electricity is a very familiar one. If the system cannot cope somewhere in one country, the integrated nature of the electricity grid means that this will have major repercussions on other countries in and outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is liability. We know that efforts are now under way in a number of Member States to discuss who will be responsible for what, if and when the millennium bug actually strikes. Some insurance companies have set aside funds, others have not. I should like to ask the Commissioner how he is handling this manifestation of the internal market? Because if liability is well regulated in one Member State of the European Union and not in another – take the problem of embedded software, for example – how ultimately are we going to deal with that? I do not think the European Union can remain passive on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is awareness. Awareness of the millennium problem means firstly that plans have to be made, above all that tests have to be run, and also that the public has to be shown what we are actually doing and what the effects of our endeavours are. The more clearly we can show our people that we are on top of things, that we are working on the problem and that it is of course soluble, the more I think popular confidence will increase. I think that is most important.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the nuclear sector. We have no idea what will happen here. So I think it is most important to pay a great deal more attention to this, because it may be an area of increasing popular anxiety. So I would urge the Commissioner and his colleagues to clarify what we are doing in Central and Eastern Europe and what we are doing in Russia, because there is of course a big question mark over that in particular, and so our citizens need to be given clear information on that point as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, a question for you. What is the European Parliament doing to ensure that the European Parliament is millennium‐compliant? Perhaps you could tell us presently what Parliament is doing. I am very curious to know.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Boogerd‐Quaak </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too must compliment Mr Donnelly on his excellent report. I should like to take up one point which previous speakers have also made. On 1 January 2000 many computers will think, if they are not millennium‐compliant, that the clock has suddenly been turned back to 1900. This carries great risks to the economy, to the environment and to people. Above all, I find the situation in Russia and a number of Central and Eastern European countries alarming. Due to the economic crisis there, efforts to deal with the millennium problem, which had in any case not received a great deal of priority, have virtually ground to a halt. Now I know that people there say that some computers do not have the problems we have in the West. But we cannot be sure of that. To be on the safe side, I recently paid a working visit to the only nuclear power plant which my country boasts. I found there that they had been working for a full year to make the plant millennium‐compliant. I also raised the question of the Central and Eastern European countries, which they were certainly aware of, and they were not happy about what is going on there. So I am grateful to Mr Donnelly for having incorporating my amendment on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Velzen raised the matter of liability, and I would mention that all insurance policies exclude disasters involving nuclear energy or other nuclear disasters. So that is one more reason to give some thought to this question.</p>
<p class="contents">I still believe that the European Union should give a lead here and be open and honest on the subject, together with Russia and Eastern Europe. It is high time that we accepted our responsibilities, and I think account must be taken of this in our aid programmes. A variety of studies show that it can be done at relatively modest cost. The total cost of resolving the Russian millennium problem is put at USD 100 million. I think that would be money well spent. If we, the citizens of the European Union, want to be sure of a safe roll‐over into the new millennium, then we too must be prepared to get our wallets out. Time is getting on. We have no time left, and the responsibility rests with the West just as much as with the East. So I would urge Commissioner Bangemann to place this subject high on the agenda, not just because of the risks of not being insured, but above all because of the damage to the environment if things do get irretrievably out of control.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kerr </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, I should like to begin with a confession. I am a complete technophobe and clearly this is why my group has chosen me to speak on this complex topic. I have read Mr Donnelly's splendid report and commend him for it. A thought did occur to me. Has he checked out that the Labour Party computers at Millbank Tower have been programmed to take account of the change so that all Members will remain on message in the year 2000 as they have in 1999?</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly this is an important issue. One fundamental question which occurred to me when I read the report is: how did it happen that computer designers and software designers were allowed to make and programme machines in such a way? Everyone knew that the year 2000 was approaching but it did not seem to occur to them to sort out this rather fundamental fault in the process of design. Then the question arises: what about the matter of liability for any damage that occurs if these machines crash? Could we sue Mr Gates for his many billions of dollars for his responsibility in the process? Or perhaps we could nationalise him as one US economist recently suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read that the British Government has done some serious preparation for this but I was slightly alarmed to read in the papers the other day that the Italian Government – I do not want to criticise my Italian friends – has just set up a study group, with no offices, no budgets and no resources, to look at this problem only nine months before the event. It seems to me a little late in the day. Indeed, Parliament is also a little late in the day with its report. But I am sure that Commissioner Bangemann will tell us that the Commission is well advanced with its planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, might I suggest that to restore confidence in Europe, Commissioner Kinnock could take to the air and fly on the eve of the year 2000 and that Commissioner Bangemann should resurrect his well‐known feats on motorcycle with Mr Barton and travel through the traffic systems of Brussels on the back of Mr Barton's motorcycle. That would reassure the citizens of Europe that the Commission has the situation well in hand.</p>

They may be far‐reaching. But it may also be that the millennium problem exists mainly in people"s heads, planted there by software manufacturers eager to make a fast buck.</p>
<p class="contents">The millennium problem brings us unequivocally up against the limitations of human knowledge and ability. To anyone who puts all his trust in technology, the millennium problem must be a huge disappointment. A mere trifle like leaving out the digits ‘19' from the year gives rise to a life‐threatening situation. We are too quick to forget that all technology is the work of human beings. We can fool ourselves that we are all‐powerful and talk about the ‘triumph of technology", but meanwhile that same technology is an enormous threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital C of the resolution rightly points the finger at the economic considerations which led to the year being displayed as two digits only. In a way, we wanted the new computer technology to produce economic results too fast. Is this not the root of a great number of current social and cultural problems? We are addicted to the pursuit of profit and economic gain. Everything has to give way to that imperative, including the natural world and our very human existence itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore particularly regrettable that Mr Donnelly"s report embroiders further on the theme of the problem‐solving ability of human intelligence. Of course we have to try to prevent possible disasters. But I think we need equally to reflect on the deeper cultural and religious causes.</p>

He is good at this sort of work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is strange that the year 2000 computer problem should exist at all. It says something about just how susceptible modern societies are to disruption. Since computers do not understand the two noughts in the year 2000, we are in a real fix; some people are panicking. For years the experts have been trying to tackle the problem and now there are just a few months left. Thus our idyllic society will not be threatened or attacked from outer space or by Russia, but by two zeros and a mistake on the part of a computer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission says that the responsibility for the year 2000 computer problem lies with the suppliers and users of computer systems. I would like to ask the Commission, then, who is responsible in the case of Russia? On Monday I visited the nuclear power plants in question in Russia, and I would like to ask the Commission how certain it is that the problem in Russia, which the rapporteur also referred to, will be properly solved. Are the plants to be run down or kept going, and what will happen about the nuclear weapon systems? My other question is what sort of problems are likely to be caused by troublemakers or out‐and‐out criminals if we reach the stage where there is some sort of state of confusion, and what does the Commission intend to do to avoid this kind of problem? Thirdly, I am pleased that the rapporteur mentioned the fact that we should be concerned about consumers and the SME sector, which face the greatest problems in these sorts of situations.</p>

Despite that, the testing of computer systems is lagging behind in many sectors, and has not even yet begun in all of them. There are some who do not even know anything about the problem at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is quite rightly addressing the possible problems the year 2000 will cause, the so‐called ‘Y2K" problem. However, it lays the main emphasis on cooperation from its Member States and the western world. But the problems are not confined to here. It is well known, and it has been pointed out here, that in Russia and its immediate surroundings there is a lack of intellectual and material resources to solve the problem. Air traffic needs up‐to‐date computer systems, particularly for computer‐based air‐traffic control systems and in modern aircraft that rely on computers; and nuclear power stations are global problems that affect us all. Failure to upgrade systems could constitute a serious danger to health and present other types of risk for people in various parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is neither a political nor an ideological one, and in dealing with it borders must not act as barriers. The EU must invest in finding a solution on a broad scale that transcends its own borders and that looks at the problem from the human angle. It is preferable to make this investment sooner rather than later, as delay could prove costly. The images of horror that have been painted by over‐imaginative science‐fiction writers, conjuring up apocalyptic visions, must not be allowed to come true. The responsibility is a global one.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lukas </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I basically agree with Mr Donnelly"s excellent report, though his comments about SMEs in recital D need to be modified a little. It is certainly not true that smaller firms lack specialist technical knowledge; on the contrary, SMEs are the ones that generate innovation and research in many fields. Their structure and specialist technical knowledge mean that they are able to react quickly to any software problems that come up. On the other hand, however, if major firms or public administrations have computer problems, these could have a massive impact on SMEs. The rapporteur"s comments on the nuclear sector in Eastern Europe and Russia are extremely important. This is a field that is receiving huge financial support from the European Union, but up to now, unfortunately, we have not seen any significant improvement in the safety of nuclear power plants.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now high time to make sure that the funding available really is used to improve reactor safety. It is probably unrealistic to hope that the nuclear power stations will be shut down by the year 2000, so we must at least ensure that there are no breakdowns caused by the year 2000 problem. We need to give top priority to eliminating any risk to the population of Europe, since Europe"s taxpayers have after all provided a lot of money for nuclear safety in Eastern Europe and Russia.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinel </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the subject we are dealing with today, the ‘Millennium bug", is an extremely impenetrable one for the majority of our fellow citizens. To save time, I will simply say that it is like a grain of sand that can cause the most sophisticated machine to grind to a halt. But we must look beyond this. I believe that it actually defines the limits of our so‐called modern society, a short‐term society built on sand, a society that often cannot see beyond the end of its nose. For the sake of saving a few minuscule bytes in systems software, two generations of computer programmers have deliberately ignored the advent of the new millennium. Even today, we still do not know how big an effect such irresponsible behaviour will have.</p>
<p class="contents">As the saying goes, to govern is to predict. Well, this is proof that no‐one is governing our world any longer. Mitterrand, Fabius and Clinton are all fighting the same war: that of the generation of those who prefer to use politics to serve their own purposes rather than their people. This is a generation where the irresponsible are in charge. This is a generation that knowingly lets populations slowly poison themselves with contaminated blood, that builds nuclear power stations knowing full well that one day they will blow up in our faces, and that would rather fly bombers over innocent crowds to detract from their sexual dalliances and conceal them.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole issue of computer faults is not as innocuous as it may seem. It is a symptom, amongst others, of this climate of decline and of the widespread shunning of responsibility, where no‐one has to answer to anyone any longer. Unfortunately, the other side of this issue is that, once again, our leaders will probably not take this new lesson seriously, and that is a shame.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, it is not true that Parliament has come to this problem too late, because it is something we have discussed on a number of occasions over the past few years, and the Commission has constantly reported on what it has been doing. We have been looking at the problem for four years now and have tried to do everything we can. I would like to thank Alan Donnelly for spelling out in his report exactly what our responsibility is and where efforts can still be made over the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out straight away that he is no Cassandra, because Cassandra"s predictions were always right. Her problem was that everything she said was always true, but this is not the case with Alan Donnelly. I am sure that some of the fears expressed here in this debate will not come true at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin by telling you what the Commission has been doing. The first problem was to make everyone aware that there was a problem, and that it affected them. I think we have now got this message across, partly thanks to the rather exaggerated reports of impending doom. The good thing about these kinds of hysterical reports is that even when they are completely exaggerated, they still have the effect of making people sit up and listen. All these horror stories of planes plummeting from the skies, electricity failures and the Labour Party being unable to count its members alarmed people so much – particularly the last of the three – that now everybody knows we have a problem on our hands. This was the most important priority, so in itself it is no bad thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did what it could to help here, focusing particularly on small and medium‐sized firms. From the outset, we involved the Member States and international authorities such as the Atomic Energy Commission in Vienna in our discussions. Of course, we had to try to ensure that the various measures were carried out by those in the best position to do so, so we did not try to do everything ourselves, but tried instead to provide the various responsible bodies with the highest possible levels of specialist knowledge, and in some cases also with funding. For example, we provided the atomic energy authority with funding to enable it to carry out operations in Eastern Europe. So we tried to get a whole series of organisations and responsible bodies involved, and in particular those directly affected in private industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is reasonably good. It is true that the smaller firms, as usual, face bigger problems, since they do not have the manpower or often the money which they need – there is now software that can solve most of the problems, of course, but it is relatively expensive, so there is also the problem of affordability.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been doing everything we have listed in the communication. We have had regular meetings with the Member States, and we have worked together, and are continuing to do so, with the relevant international organisations in the financial, telecommunications, energy and transport fields. These fields were not chosen at random, but because they vary in the way in which they use computers. For example, if you have computers that are designed and programmed to run according to a regular timetable, they are more likely to suffer from the problem than computers that have nothing to do with regular timetables and simply collect data. The data are not linked to particular time intervals and will therefore not be affected by the millennium bug. So this is something else that needs to be looked into.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are working with all those concerned to try to establish exactly what they can do and what we have to do to ensure that the various infrastructure sectors carry on operating smoothly. If people wanted, the Commission could even do more, particularly in the way of providing financial support. But the sums that the individual private firms affected need to spend are so great that it is hard to imagine any public authorities being able to afford to pay them. Of course, we have done everything that needs to be done to guarantee immediate security, but many of those involved are also doing a great deal at their own expense to protect their own interests. I cannot imagine any airport in the world that works with computer systems and that has not found a solution to the problem by now, and it would be absolutely unthinkable if there were airlines that had not now taken the necessary precautions on board their aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">What else can we do to adapt the legal provisions if necessary? This is an interesting question, because it is an area where we could already be taking action. We have looked into this too. Legal rules already exist to deal with problems such as this, because in legal terms it is nothing new. Anyone who makes a mistake when supplying a product or service must of course take responsibility if it is a culpable error or if there is no‐fault liability. Firms which use a lot of suppliers working with these kinds of systems have in many cases already written to them to point out that if there is any disruption they will hold the suppliers responsible. In other words, they themselves have let their suppliers know that they will be held to be at the very least negligent if they do not tackle the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we do not think it would be a good idea to propose new legal rules. Alan Donnelly mentioned the ‘Good Samaritan Legislation", the new American law designed to promote the provision of information by limiting liability for declarations of millennium compliance. Of course, this does not encourage people to tackle the millennium bug, quite the reverse, unfortunately. So we think that the existing legal rules, together with the information that suppliers are being given, will be enough to deal with the problem in legal terms. Of course, this will not be the case everywhere. For example, someone asked whether Parliament will continue to operate after the year 2000. This is a question not of legal responsibility but of political expedience, and the Commission does not wish to comment on it at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone else asked what we are doing about our own computer systems. It would hardly be good for the Commission if we spent five years telling everyone to do something about the problem but failed to do anything ourselves. Of course we have ensured that our own systems will operate. A project designed to ensure that they are millennium‐compliant is nearing completion. Once we have done the tests, we will be able to inform you that the Commission at least will be operating after the year 2000, if that is any consolation to you!</p>
