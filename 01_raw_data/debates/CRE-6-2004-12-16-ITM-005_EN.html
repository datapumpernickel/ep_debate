I understand and share the concerns and interest of the European Parliament on such an important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to assure you that I know full well how important this issue is, not only to the European Parliament, not only to the European Commission, but also to our millions of citizens and, of course, to farmers and to all the agencies involved. I have no doubt that the European Community has a very important role to play in improving conditions under which animals can be fed, transported and slaughtered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The need to ensure that animal welfare is improved during transport as a matter of day-to-day reality and not just on the statute book is an important objective for me. I have long been aware of the unsatisfactory way that the current legislation on transport is being applied and of the apparent lack of priority given to this area of legislation by national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The correct and full enforcement of animal welfare legislation is essential, as is the immediate improvement of the conditions of animal transport. This is why the Commission, despite its desire to do more to restrict transport-by-road times and reduce stock intensity on vehicles, accepts the presidency's step-by-step initiative in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We felt it was important to make the significant progress that was already within our grasp, rather than to defer the whole dossier to a later indefinite date. This, as I will point out later, is without prejudice – and I would like to emphasise this – to any improved future solution. In doing this, we have opted for much stricter rules, significantly improving current conditions, to be applied as soon as possible. They will cover matters such as long-distance transport or new, substantially upgraded standards for vehicles. These will be enforced in the shortest possible time within EU standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out that the vast majority of Parliament's amendments have been integrated and incorporated into the final text and I thank Parliament for its important contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no problem in admitting that it is unfortunate that there was no agreement on the issue of restrictions on the travel time and the transport density. There was no chance – and I have to be frank about this – of such provisions being supported in the Council, and the failure to reach agreement at the April 2004 Agricultural Council was a clear warning. But failure to reach agreement at the last Council would have meant an indefinite continuation of the existing unacceptable conditions and a significant delay in their improvement. This does not mean, however, that the Commission does not believe that all possibilities for reinforcing the provisions on travel time should and will be exploited in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – and this is not the only possibility – the final text provides for the Commission to report back to the Council within – not after – four years of the date of implementation on the issue of travel time and loading densities and possibly to modify its approach on the basis of the experience acquired from the application of the new rules. However, in addition – and this is important – regardless of what the regulation provides, the Commission will carefully analyse the situation, including the prevailing political conditions, and will avail itself of its power of initiative. I <span class="italic">explicitly</span> retained this right when giving our consent to the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly list some of the improvements that this new regulation will introduce in the near future. I have a list of four pages and I will not read them all. Before I do so, I want to remind honourable Members that the regulation states that Member States have the right to adopt and implement stricter rules within their territory than those provided for in the regulation. Therefore, this is a challenge for the Member States, and it is a challenge for you. If enough Member States adopt stricter rules then the political pressure – the peer pressure – on the rest would be much more evident and effective. However, we need the improvements in the existing regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a satellite navigation system will be used on road vehicles from 2007. There will be forced ventilation and temperature monitoring inside the trucks, with improvements in water facilities and drinking facilities, individual stalls for the transport of horses and other conditions in relation to horses. There will be stricter conditions for the training of drivers and a ban on transporting pregnant, sick and wounded animals. There will also be administrative provisions to ensure consistency between checks by officials in different Member States. This will apply to all journeys.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the use of satellite navigation systems was promoted by the European Parliament last month and supported by the Commission. This represents an innovative and promising tool to monitor animal transport, and the Commission is ready to invest immediately in this. The proper use of this technology will contribute to the promotion of a more transparent and high-quality approach to animal transport in Europe, in tune with the wishes of our citizens but also enabling better enforcement. This is extremely important. It is not enough to regulate or adopt rules, we must have the means to enforce them and to supervise their enforcement. European citizens have pointed out on innumerable occasions and in many ways that the lack of effective enforcement has been an appreciable weakness of the current system. I fully agree with that. I am determined and committed to ensuring better enforcement of animal welfare rules and to insisting that Member States report precisely on the state of play of the controls carried out. We will continue to press Member States for this information and I am pleased that the new legislation will allow us to do so in a more efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we stated in the Council that the Commission reserves the right to respond in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, with due regard to the welfare requirements of animals. Therefore, the Commission will continue to be vigilant and will closely monitor the situation on animal transport in Member States. We are prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future should animal welfare conditions need further improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on two more issues. First, the improvement of animal welfare is a continuous process. It is not just a regulation, we are already working on other improvements on poultry and on microclimates within the transport vehicles. Therefore it is not the end, it is just the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I have looked at what the options were at the last Council meeting. They were not between the optimum maximum and the compromise, they were between the compromise and continuing indefinitely with the present situation, with all the unacceptable conditions that prevail at this point. I am certain you will understand that if one has the responsibility of taking a decision, one has to weigh the pros and cons and decide in which direction to go. I can assure you that the Commission's only concern on this issue was the welfare of the animals and how to make practical improvements as soon as possible. It was not just to insist on a principle which eventually would harm the animals, because it would not enable us to improve the existing conditions in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, the present compromise significantly improves the present situation without depriving the Commission of the right to come back to these very important issues. Believe me, it was a Commission proposal. We would have been much happier if these provisions were included and accepted in the compromise. But, unfortunately, there was no possibility of such an agreement. If I may, I suggest talking to the various NGOs. They were not happy but they accepted this compromise because they realised that it is a significant step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and I would be interested to hear your comments as I feel that Parliament will be a significant ally of the Commission in this matter – I can assure you that my intention is, before the end of this Commission's term and definitely before the end of this Parliament's term, to come back with a new proposal and have a new discussion. The Commission is committed to this. But, the big question and the big challenge will be to convince the Member States to accept this new proposal when it comes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have only just assumed your duties, and I think that your position at all events opens up the possibility of a very good future working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on this, too. I am saying this with good reason: you hit the nail on the head when you said just now that the main problem regarding animal transport in Europe is the lack of priority given to it by national authorities. This is our sticking point, and remedying it would represent tremendous progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to give an example by way of illustration. I note that, at the present time, the Austrian government, in particular, is doing a good job and is exercising good supervision. This is resulting in a large proportion of the international transport of stock for slaughter travelling to Italy by routes other than Austria all of a sudden. This is the kind of situation that arises when a number of other Member States neglect their duties. In that regard, the Austrian model should become the European model: with effective legislation and effective enforcement. This is the way to put an end to all the unpleasant debate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council has come to an agreement, and has made a corresponding amendment without giving prior notice to Parliament, which I find very disconcerting and also blameworthy on the part of the Council. On the other hand, I must add that we should have been even worse off without this initiative, because we cannot deny that the agreement does constitute an improvement on the existing legislation. You know Parliament’s line of thinking. I myself was rapporteur on the subject of a maximum journey time for stock for slaughter. This has now proved unattainable in the Council. Nevertheless, I note that the introduction of the satellite tracking system has become a reality, at all events, and that enforcement of the existing rules is to be improved. In that regard, I should like to hear how the Commission intends to enforce this at Member State level. Are other instruments necessary in this regard, including on the part of Parliament? I should also like to know how the Commission intends to support this in the context of improving training. Finally, I note that farm-to-farm transport has been liberalised. We should have liked to see 100 kilometres, but this was evidently unattainable in the Council. Nevertheless, we have taken a small step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention two other points. First of all, there is still a great deal of criticism of the means of regulation of the transport of breeding stock and the rest periods stated for this. Animals must be transported as quickly as possible, and introducing the minimum possible number of rest periods for the transit of breeding stock, too – which is undertaken in the main in very favourable conditions – would be a step forward. This means that animals can also be transported over medium distances. The same goes for the roll-on/roll-off system on ferries. Telling Member States in plain language that this is normal rest time would also be a great help. All this would represent another few steps forward in improving the quality of animal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former rapporteur, I am a little disappointed that no maximum journey times for stock for slaughter have been agreed. Nevertheless, I see that this package as a whole does represent a genuine step forward. I am extremely curious to hear what proposals the Commissioner intends to make before 2009 for the establishment of a good working relationship with Parliament, and also, in particular, for making Member States comply with the European rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share his disappointment over the Council’s compromise. It brings no improvement in the journey times for animal transport, none in the rest periods and none in the maximum stocking density, and that could endure for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the Council every success in attempting to explain this compromise to the European public. It is an extremely bad one, including for the image of the whole sector, and one that is unacceptable from an animal welfare point of view. I therefore support the proposal by my fellow Members to limit the maximum journey time to eight hours. Only a decision of this nature would demonstrate that Europe is really serious about sustainable agriculture, one of the priorities of which must be animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is built in small steps, as we all know, and indeed that is a very good thing, in many cases even the best way. Whilst the EU is taking excessively small steps here towards improving animal welfare, animals in Europe are being dragged back and forth for thousands of kilometres in atrocious conditions. It will be nice and reassuring for them to know that they are being watched by satellites all along. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important issue. I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are fed, transported and slaughtered. As the Commissioner stated, the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation. Some of them have been mentioned already: proposals for satellite tracking systems, ventilation and temperature monitoring, stricter conditions for driver training and a greater number of official inspections in different countries. Progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to nail my colours to the mast because I am an MEP who represents a constituency that is both rural and urban. Agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the north and west of Ireland. Indeed, the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Live animal exports are a hugely important, legitimate business for Ireland. We export 90% of our animals and about 10% of those, or 200 000 live cattle, are exported every year to markets in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. This trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually. Therefore, a vibrant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire livestock sector. I believe we must have access to the single market. There is an important market for Irish weanlings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hindered. Surely, free access to the market is one of the cornerstones of EU policy. We also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture, not just in Ireland, but also in the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, I agree with the Commissioner. We need enforcement and no one has a problem with that – consumers or farmers, it is in all our interests. Another issue regarding live export is that the trade provides competition in Ireland. This is another cornerstone of EU policy. I believe we have made progress; there is probably further to go, but the Commission is doing useful work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of technical improvements were at the cost of up to six years’ blocking of the issue of protecting our animals. This would mean that, throughout their periods of office, neither Parliament nor the Commission would be given an opportunity to improve the conditions of animals, a state of affairs that is quite unreasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council decision departed so completely from the proposal that I even doubted its legality. Mr Kyprianou, I hope you realise your ambition of coming back with density figures and transport times as soon as possible. I also hope that you make use of the Treaty’s articles concerning transport, consumer issues or health as a legal basis so that Parliament can participate through the codecision procedure. We could then together break the Council’s resistance to providing animals with reasonable conditions. Unfortunately, the Council listens more to lobbyists than to opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The maturity of a society is shown by the way in which it treats those who are defenceless. If the rules governing the transport of animals are an indicator of Europe’s maturity, we are unfortunately still barbarians. I invite all ministers to travel, together with myself, between Stockholm and Brussels under the conditions that apply to the transport of animals. They might then understand what they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are regarded as 75-kilo sheep, there will be ten of us in an area as large as a double bed. If we are regarded as chickens, we shall see how faeces from those above fall down onto those below. If we are regarded as pigs, we shall, in accordance with the Council decision, be given nothing less than electric shocks if we refuse to move. We shall also be given water only after 14 hours before continuing for another 14 hours. We must also try to ensure that, in accordance with the Council rules, the temperature is kept above five degrees Centigrade during the journey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet again, animals have lost out when there is a choice to be made between protecting them or the profits of the firms that fatten them up. I will nonetheless concede that the Commission has made an effort, and I will not deny that a number of changes have been made for the better, but the underlying principle has remained the same as it was before.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those of you in the Council who have decided not to have a limit on transport times for animals and that the permitted density should not be specified, and I am absolutely convinced that you would be quick to introduce other rules if your domestic pets were to be transported the length and breadth of Europe. If we want to defend the right to life and the rights of animals, then we need to approach this from a different angle.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the GSP satellite navigation system does, of course, achieve something; it means that checks can be better carried out. There is no disputing that. Likewise, if it is ensured that the animals are given water and improved ventilation, that is of course a small advance, but it does not solve the problem. If you want regional development, this is a real opportunity to demonstrate it, for you can raise animals, fatten them up, and process them on the spot or within the local area without having to organise these transports from one end of the European Union to the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I really cannot understand how Mr Maat can describe this as tremendous progress. I cannot see it as such.

However, this toothless Parliament passes resolutions that are then ignored by both the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions made by this Parliament on the transportation of animals have been repeatedly ignored and horrendous suffering continues. Over 3 million animals every year endure journeys lasting 30 hours or more in unacceptable conditions and many die in transit.</p>
<p class="contents">Were this not bad enough, even more suffering is now being planned by the European Union under the REACH Directive, and we will see millions more animals moved around for live testing. To those in the outside world – the real world – who are as appalled as I am by all this, I have a simple message. I wish the European Union would interfere and legislate less, for if the European Union is the answer it must surely have been a very stupid question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I venture to suggest it has given rise to more concern than the plight of the millions of children dying of starvation or living in unacceptable conditions in contemporary Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If the humanitarian organisations acting in the interests of those individuals had shown the same determination as their counterparts promoting the cause of animals, something could probably have been done to help the European children dying day after day.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be more specific. Parliament has issued two opinions on animal welfare in transit over the last three years. I do not believe it is appropriate to devote any more time to the matter, as fortunately it was finally settled this November, following the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the compromise proposal tabled by the Irish Presidency was better. It contained a reasonable restriction on journey times, taking account of both the animal welfare and the question of freedom of movement of goods within the European Union. I would remind the House of the times in question, namely nine hours of journey time plus twelve for rest and a further nine hours of journey time. The agreement reached today under the Dutch Presidency does not imply any change to existing regulations on journey time. The decision on this crucial issue in the debate has been postponed for six years.</p>
<p class="contents">The postponement is due to the differences of opinion that still exist between the Member States. It amounts to stalemate. Nonetheless, I would like to clarify one aspect I feel many of those following the debates have overlooked, and which should be brought to the notice of the citizens. Existing regulations already impose a maximum travel time of eight hours when vehicles that do not comply with the welfare standards laid down in the regulations are used. In addition, these standards have been tightened up by virtue of the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage. However, it is extremely disappointing – as everyone has said – that we could not get something on journey times, one of the key issues; or on stocking densities. Member States can adopt tougher legislation. We in this Parliament want a bigger say on these issues, but at the moment we do not have it. I will certainly press my own government to go further on this.</p>

It could, of course, be transferred to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Kyprianou who would be responsible for the matter, which sounds more reassuring.</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, it is the Justice Ministry that is responsible for this matter. We regard animal protection as legal protection, but Article 37 is exclusively about increasing production and earnings. The poor animals must suffer heaven knows what kind of mistreatment when protection itself is subject to greed. It is actually grotesque that export subsidies are paid when horses, cows and sheep have to be sent out of the EU. Animals that are to be slaughtered should only be driven to the nearest abattoir and for a maximum of eight hours. We have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark. Animals that are not to be slaughtered should only be transported for eight hours without rest, food and a change of air, and the accommodation must be in order. That is also something favoured by a majority in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the previous Parliament stated this too, and it has to be asked why the Commission did not go to the Council and insist on these conditions being respected. When we obtain the new Constitution, Parliament will have the right of codecision and, if animal protection had no longer been subject to Article 37, Parliament would now already have had this right.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding another matter – namely transparency – our Ombudsman expressly stated that the provisions of the new Constitution could properly be used when there was such large support for doing so, so there is a double opportunity for involving Parliament in this procedure right now. What has happened is that a strategy has been chosen whereby a decision has been hurried through, almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remote from the decision-making concerned over the next six years. We, indeed I, have noted that the Member States must implement decisions that go further ...</p>

For this reason, it is a matter for the European Commission and the European Parliament. For years, Parliament has been inundated with petitions from people rightly calling for attention to abuses in animal transport. This applies in particular to horses that come to the end of their useful life in the East but are destined to be slaughtered and eaten in the South. Many animals spend a very long time in transit in lorries, with little to eat or drink, foul themselves, start to panic and suffer injury. The only way to prevent this is to drastically reduce the distance and time permitted for the transport of live animals. At the start of 2004, the dispute in this Parliament was a question of eight hours versus nine hours of continuous transport and of limited, cheap protective measures versus further-reaching, more expensive measures. At that time, Parliament made a very moderate choice, but even that went too far for the governments of a number of Member States. As a result, there is still scope for allowing those abuses to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The key question is whether we accept this unnecessary animal suffering in anticipation of a resulting reduction in the costs of the livestock trade and of road transport companies, or whether we consider this suffering to be completely at variance with our civilisation and our responsibility for the welfare of our fellow creatures. My choice is emphatically in favour of civilisation and responsibility. What the Commissioner is now announcing is the failure of decision making in the European Union. We have shown ourselves to be unable to do what is urgently needed. National economic interests are taking precedence over our shared civilisation and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to Commissioner Kyprianou speak, I have no doubt as to his good intentions. I support his announcement of new initiatives by the European Commission. I also agree with his view that it would be better to start quickly on the basis of a woefully inadequate result than of no result at all. Satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals. Let us not trust solely in new technologies, but rather build on the political will to genuinely eliminate this abuse. That is what is important. I hope that we are able to achieve real results by the end of the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission, because what is currently taking place is an absolute disgrace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a failure of implementation, not a failure of regulation. In fact, in many cases we have over-regulation but also non-implementation. This has led to problems for farmers and those engaged in what is a very legitimate trade. One of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers. The new agriculture support system urges farmers to opt for market-led farming. There is a legitimate market in mainland Europe for young cattle from Irish farms. Are we going to tell farmers that they cannot engage in this legitimate trade? I do not think we can, because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers. However, animal welfare must of course also be a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">One colleague raised concerns about Lebanon. Irish cattle go to Lebanon. Again, it is a case of implementing the regulations that are there. If we stop that trade, animals will still move to Lebanon, perhaps from Australia and other areas. If our concerns are for animals, we must have concerns for animals across the world and not just European animals.</p>
<p class="contents">As for reducing journey times and stocking densities, I urge that we be guided by science and not emotion, because this debate has been too much guided by emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to refer you to independent research carried out in Ireland on the transport of animals from Ireland to Spain.

I believe this agreement has one very positive aspect. It postpones the most controversial issues until 2011. I refer to the issues instrumental in the failure of negotiations last April, namely journey times and stocking densities. Some of the honourable Members present today will recall the debate in the last Parliament with Mr Maat. It emerged then that, as Mrs McGuinness just stated, there is no solid scientific basis regarding the two issues of journey time and density. In addition, larger Member States and the peripheral ones were seriously penalised. All this economic background was presented as an animal welfare issue, as if Members from large and peripheral countries were not concerned about animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe the political agreement makes good many of the shortcomings identified in current provisions. This is its most positive aspect. It improves control systems, it introduces technological features facilitating control, it provides for a clear and transparent system of registration and it improves systems of cooperation between Member States. In addition, it spells out the duty of setting up training systems that will also improve the transport of animals. I particularly welcome Article 32, because it lays down clearly the basis for future reviews of these provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, therefore, I am bound to congratulate the Council for moving the issue forward, and I look forward to successful implementation of the new text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That this should be so certainly has to do with the subject matter, but also with the fact that what we are dealing with here is a never-ending story. This is not the first time, not the second, and not even the third, but perhaps the umpteenth time that we have had to give this our attention. For well over ten years, we have sought to make improvements in this area, and there has always been talk of progress, but the crucial progress has not materialised. We will, I believe, achieve a real breakthrough only when this House acquires the right of codecision in agricultural matters as well. I believe we are more likely to get that than the satellite navigation system. It is there that I have greater confidence in our ability to get our way.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter in hand, I would like to say that this is, of course, also about transport times, but what is of the essence is whether the conditions are right, that is, whether the animals are carted off in torment or whether they travel as our fellow-creatures. If someone goes to the Middle East and buys an Arabian stallion for stud purposes, they do not need to worry that it will arrive here in a poor condition. Likewise, if our animals travel to the Olympic Games, they will arrive in a fit and proper state. It follows that it is the conditions that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters, I think, is that we should comply with what the consumers want. In Germany, we have set up programmes for quality meat in which transport time is among the quality criteria. Organic farming is another example, with the nearest slaughterhouse being the one that is used. Where that is a measure of quality, it will also become accepted practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animals suffer from human callousness and thoughtlessness, and improving their fate is a challenge to our humanity. It is not merely sensitivity to the harm done to animals that makes action necessary, but also the awareness that it is only a small step from cruelty to animals to cruelty to humans.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation under discussion moves in the right direction. It introduces higher standards for the protection of animals in transport, although these standards are still inadequate, and it leads one to hope that animals will suffer less. As an MEP whose voters include Polish farmers, I am delighted at this. In Polish family-owned farms, which are mainly small, animals are treated with great affection, and even as individuals. It breaks farmers’ hearts when the animals they cared for are treated brutally after being sold.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation we are discussing will bring progress, but it is not a solution to the problem. Legal regulations must be accompanied by effective implementation, which can be fraught with difficulty. Poland, for example, is a large transit country and it experiences problems with the transport of horses. Legal standards have been put in place, but the monitoring bodies, police and veterinary inspectors are often helpless when faced with the problem of what to do with illegal transports, carrying injured animals for instance. There is a need for a network of stopover points where transported animals could be provided with food and drink or given necessary veterinary care. In urgent cases, the animals could be put down at these points if necessary. The European Union should provide financial support for the setting up of such a network, and Poland at any rate requires such assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a genuine breakthrough in the transport of animals will only come about when long-distance transports are fully abolished. Animals should be slaughtered close to where they have been bred. Humanitarian considerations are not the sole reason for this. Sanitary considerations are also at issue. I would remind you that as shown by the recent report of the Court of Auditors, control is practically lost over animals transported abroad. Ladies and gentlemen...</p>

Last year alone, one animal protection organisation collected 500 000 signatures in Denmark, that is to say half a million signatures in a country with only just over five million inhabitants. All the more reason for criticising the way in which this proposal has been hurried through. As a Member of the European Parliament, I could not obtain access to the proposal until a few hours before it was in actual fact adopted. It might well actually have been the case, Commissioner, that if there had been a little more time in which to debate this issue and if there had been a public debate surrounding it in the individual countries of Europe, the ministers would have been rather more amenable. I actually think you should be serious about the statements you have made in this House today. I think you should have the matter put on the agenda again as quickly as possible so that we can have a public debate and so that the politicians and ministers can be put under pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The big problem in this case is that we think too much about the internal market. The internal market is of course a splendid and commendable thing but, once in a while, we must also pause and bear some ethical considerations in mind. We are now treating animals as if they were commodities. Animals are not commodities. Animals are living beings and must, of course, be treated as such.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also question whether the proposal that has now unfortunately become legislation is at all tenable in purely legal terms. In purely legal terms, can there be any defence of Parliament’s being deprived of influence, as it has been? When this legislation is revised, or in other words re-examined, it will be possible to bypass Parliament. As I see it, that alone is a good enough reason for investigating whether this decision is at all sustainable in legal terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Where animal transports are concerned, the issue is clear: whom does it benefit when animals are transported over long distances? It is to the benefit of mass livestock farming, a form of livestock farming that will get Europe nowhere. What we need is not just the right measures, but also stringent checks, and this is where the attitude of the Member States cannot be described as anything other than truly shameful. If we are to have these checks, we need an infrastructure, and this infrastructure also means resting points, for which we must make provision, and loading stations where vehicles must be obliged to dock when the provisions on the protection of animals in transit are breached. That must be enforced, and we – this House and the Commission – must together require the Member States, once and for all, to implement in practice a new strategy for agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know it is not, and I think you know it is not, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great shame that the Council is not here to be held to account. I have to say as well that I am disappointed that my own government voted in favour of this shabby deal; because a few technical improvements are now completely overshadowed by the failure to make any progress on journey times and stocking density. As a result, it seems this shockingly cruel practice will continue for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I notice, however, that you explicitly reserve the right to bring forward better proposals. I welcome that, and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible, and in particular to introduce a maximum eight-hour journey time for both slaughter and further fattening animals. You can be sure that Parliament will be an ally on this, even more so if we have codecision. It is crucial that we send out a strong signal to all Member State governments that support for live exports is unacceptable in a civilised society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share most of your concerns and most of your views. However, as I have already said, the Commission felt that there was a need for immediate action. Some of you said that this compromise has been rushed through. But at the same time, some of you said that this has been pending for more than ten years. I believe, therefore, that we had an obligation to find a solution as soon as possible, without just saying that we would not continue these efforts for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Member States can do more. They can adopt stricter rules, not just for animals originating from their territory but also for transit animals. So there could be, through this, a possibility of stricter regulations covering a much wider area and affecting much more transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the subsidies are concerned I must remind Parliament that even though we do not have the right – because of various international agreements – to legislate on movement of animals outside the territory, nevertheless the European Union has linked the export subsidies to animal welfare requirements during transport. Therefore to link the two is a substantial step as it brings compliance to a great extent, even though not through immediate legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that implementation is very important. We will put greater emphasis on the issue of travel times, including all the other improvements that need to be made. We will gather enough scientific evidence to be able to convince even those who are reluctant at this stage. Therefore we will continue to monitor the situation and get this evidence that can be used in a future proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the staging point, this regulation has increased both the welfare situation and the bio-security situation. Even though I understand and share the disappointment of many of you with regard to this regulation, at the same time, we must not, through this emotional approach, disregard significant improvements that have been made to the regulation. Travel times are very important – that is why they were included in the Commission proposal; but conditions during travel are just as important. They are being improved and dealt with in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission examined the legal problems referred to in the way in which the decision was taken. I can assure you that we checked with the legal services and everything was done in a proper legal way.</p>
<p class="contents">While I share your concerns, we feel that this was a good compromise. It has gone the right way. Some of us might have wanted to go one step further, or take one step less, but it is nevertheless going in the right direction. The Commission will continue to monitor and follow the implementation. Implementation is in the hands of the Member States. Agreement on any future proposal coming from the Commission will again, in the final analysis, be in the hands of the Member States. Therefore it is something on which Parliament and the Commission have to work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
