This extension will ensure that support continues to be provided to such enterprises until the end of the current Financial Perspective, and indeed the debate has already begun on the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, which is intended to replace the current programme and is due to be launched in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the co<span class="bold">–</span>legislators have approved additional funding, and I can assure you that we will be able to put these funds to effective use in order to provide small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises with access to loan and equity finance. Access to financial instruments continues to be a major problem for around 10<span class="bold">–</span>20% of European small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Eurobarometer surveys reveal time and time again that financing problems are the greatest obstacle to business start<span class="bold">–</span>ups, and the Community financing instruments deployed under the multiannual programme have proved very successful in overcoming this problem. External evaluators have agreed that our market<span class="bold">–</span>oriented concept is exemplary, and Parliament has also acknowledged this success by approving annual increases in the funds made available for these instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation with the European Investment Fund and use of the financial markets allow us to mobilise funds at a rate of up to 1:40 with guarantee instruments and of an average of 1:4 with the more specialised equity capital instrument, which is targeted at a smaller number of enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The additional EUR 7 million proposed by Mrs Thomsen and approved by the House today will therefore mobilise many times this sum in investment capital for existing small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises and business start<span class="bold">–</span>ups.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission drafted its proposal in mid<span class="bold">–</span>2004, when the European Investment Fund was extremely pessimistic about the financing instruments’ chances of success in the 2005<span class="bold">–</span>2006 period, and when there was a lack of certainty over the amount of funding that would be available in the last year of the present Financial Perspective. It was for this reason that we were cautious when deciding on the figure that appears in our proposal on the financing instruments. Positive feedback from the European Investment Fund means that we now have a better idea of the market chances of these instruments, as well as a clear idea of the funds that will be available under the 2006 Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to build on this success in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and over EUR 1 billion of the Programme’s total proposed budget, which has been set at EUR 4.2 billion for the 2007<span class="bold">–</span>2013 period, has been earmarked for financing instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have put forward proposals for two new financing instruments that will operate alongside the existing ones. The first of these is a new risk capital instrument, which is a facility for high<span class="bold">–</span>growth and innovative small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises, and which is specially targeted at innovative small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises that require funding of between EUR 200 000 and EUR 2.5 million at the most crucial stage of their development. Finally, a new securitisation window has been proposed, the aim of which is to make it easier for local and regional banks to lend more to small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, the programme’s financing component has always been very close to the heart of the European Parliament and has consequently been increased each year by Parliament and the Council during the annual budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The background to the proposal to extend the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship by one year is that the functions of the programme will in future be performed by its successor programme, the ‘Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation’, which is planned to run from 2007<span class="bold">–</span>2013 to coincide with the financial perspective. The time<span class="bold">–</span>frame will therefore also coincide with the Seventh Research Framework Programme, which creates scope for better coordination between the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">It was initially disappointing for me to learn that the Commission’s proposal to extend the programme by a year involved returning to the level originally budgeted for in the framework programme. I therefore proposed to increase the budget for extension by EUR 9.5 million more than the figure in the Commission’s proposal. That amount was proposed partly because it would correspond to the actual expenditure on the programme in 2004 and partly because it would make the budget for 2006 <span class="bold">– </span>the extension year <span class="bold">– </span>level with the average for the previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it should be pointed out that what we have here is a programme that both users and evaluation experts regard as operating smoothly and achieving its objectives. It is important to maintain and extend aid to entrepreneurs and small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises in Europe. They are the backbone of the European economy, and their continued growth is a condition of achieving the Lisbon objectives. Finally, the external evaluation report has stressed that the financial instruments in the existing programme in large measure cover the needs of the new Member States. Restricting funds would therefore impede the integration of those countries into the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the programme’s financing component, the most frequently used financial instrument, the ‘SMEs’ Guarantee Facility’, had provided aid to 112 000 small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises in Europe by the end of 2002. Ninety<span class="bold">–</span>three per cent of these 112 000 enterprises had fewer than ten employees, but six per cent had fewer than 50 employees. The programme operates smoothly and is wide<span class="bold">–</span>ranging, and I was therefore very pleased when a unified Committee on Industry, Research and Energy backed my proposal for an increase in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the extension is to enter into force on 1 January 2006, an agreement at first reading was important for both Parliament and the Council. My colleague, Mr Březina, and I met with the Council and the Commission on several occasions and now concur with the Council about an agreement at first reading involving an increase in the budget of EUR 7 million instead of the EUR 9.5 million I originally proposed. This constitutes a compromise, ensuring that the activities of the programme’s InfoCentre, together with similar activities, can be continued without a break from 1 January 2006, at the same time as the financial instruments are developed and strengthened in order to meet the growing demand from small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Luxembourg Presidency, which has demonstrated great political flair and a tireless willingness to compromise; to the Commission, which has provided technical analyses and guidance in support of the negotiations; and, finally, to my fellow MEP Mr Březina, whose active participation in the meetings and unfailing support I valued very highly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although we are extending the programme primarily supporting entrepreneurs, and especially SMEs, by just one year until the end of 2006, this is a significant tool which should, in the context of the Lisbon objectives, contribute to and enhance the growth and competitiveness of enterprises in a knowledge<span class="bold">–</span>based and internationalised economy. The importance of this decision lies above all in creating a bridge between the current programme and the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation for the years 2007<span class="bold">-</span>2013. This extension will give businesses easier access to Community support services, programmes and networks, and help to improve the coordination of these facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing on the new Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, we are to look into the evaluation of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship prepared for the Commission in November last year, in order to tailor the new programme more effectively and promote entrepreneurship in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen, for the excellent job she has done, not least in smoothly securing this extension and negotiating with the Council an increase in funding from EUR 81.5 million to EUR 88.5 million for 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was present at the special meeting held in Strasbourg when the Commissioner spoke for the first time about his personal experience of this multiannual programme for SMEs, and I paid very close attention to what he had to say on the matter. In a nutshell, he said that he had been shocked to learn of the cumbersome application process, particularly in view of the fact that the programme was intended to boost innovation. He had also been shocked to discover that the main recipients of funding were not the small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises that needed it most, but resourceful enterprises that knew the ins and outs of the programmes and were therefore granted money. In his opinion, it is for this reason that the programmes ought to be made more rigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the Commissioner, as his analysis is entirely correct. I am glad to see that there appears to have been a shift in thinking on this matter, and he deserves thanks for having made SMEs the focus of initiatives for growth and increased competitiveness. We will be right behind him if he goes on to demand of his officials that programmes should exist not merely for bureaucratic reasons or because they have impressive names, but only if they concentrate on SMEs, or in other words on those enterprises that are in need of help. We have had enough of programmes that are nothing more than fancy names; what we need now are clear and innovative strategies for SMEs and new forms of financing.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, these programmes will be combined in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme. This is both a consistent approach and a step in the right direction, and I particularly welcome the fact that parallels will exist between this Programme and the Seventh Research Framework Programme. We must not repeat past mistakes, however, even if everything is now to be combined in a new document. What matters is that growth and jobs are the ultimate goals, rather than the ideological gratification of political groups. Yet we are running the risk of this being precisely what happens in the case of the CIP; one need only look at the heavy emphasis on eco<span class="bold">–</span>innovations and energy efficiency for proof of this. More questions need to be asked in this respect, and I will be able to ask some of these in my capacity as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">We are about to adopt a new Financial Perspective, at a time when the citizens of all the EU Member States are being increasingly careful with their money. They will regard it as unforgivable if we, their legislator, miss the opportunity now available to us to opt for the provision of real support to SMEs and for priority to be given to creating more jobs, and if we instead indulge in ideological disputes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our reaction has been both rapid and extremely flexible, thus meeting market expectations. I can see six Commission representatives in the Chamber, and I would congratulate every one of them. This piece of legislation has taken less time to adopt than nearly any other in the history of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen, as he not only talks about better regulation, but also puts his money where his mouth is. This is what really matters: ‘just do it’, to quote one company’s constant refrain. I should also like to offer my warm congratulations to Mrs Thomsen. Although she is a new Member of this House, she has helped us to set a record, as it can by no means be taken for granted that legislation will be adopted in such a short space of time. We are all aware that negotiations on the European company went on for over 30 years, and that we have still not achieved our ultimate goal.</p>
<p class="contents">What it comes down to is that we wish to shape the Lisbon process, and in order to do so we need this programme. What Lisbon means, of course, is employment and growth, and we have already established that small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized enterprises have accounted for 75% of new jobs created in recent years. The question we must ask ourselves is what growth really means. The hope of every employee, every pensioner and every child is to see a small improvement, in net terms, in their personal finances at the end of each year. We must therefore fight to ensure that we all have a little bit more money in our accounts at the end of future years, as has been the case over the past 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our duty to provide as many people as possible with this opportunity, and those who have jobs and are in employment obviously have more money in the bank than those who are unemployed. Even though a speedy and welcome decision has been taken on this programme, which has even allowed for an increase in funding, Parliament, the Council and the Commission should therefore make every effort to ensure that we do in fact achieve the Lisbon goals, in particular when debating the Financial Perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
