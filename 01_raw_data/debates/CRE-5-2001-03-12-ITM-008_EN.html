<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Daul (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today Parliament has to decide on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In its explanatory statement, the Commission stresses that the COM has satisfactorily fulfilled many of its objectives and legitimately proposes that the status quo with regard to prices be maintained, but only for two years and with adjustments contradicting the assessment initially made by the Commission. It, moreover, proposes to carry out a series of particularly delicate and complex studies in record time to provide a basis for a proposal for fundamental reform in two years’ time. The Council was not wrong-footed by this approach and opted to renew this COM for a further five-year period.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft comes before us at a time when the agricultural industry is experiencing one of the worst crises with which it has ever had to deal. Is that, however, sufficient reason to reform a COM which, even in the estimation of the Commission, has fulfilled its objectives? I do not think so. That is why I think it reasonable to allow this COM to continue to operate on the present basis for a period of five years. This is the proposal I put to you today as your rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">My first observation is this: from a great many of the various parties I contacted in preparing my report I heard fairly constant criticism of the excessive Community price for sugar. To clarify the reasons for this situation, I think I ought to point out that the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector is atypical in more ways than one.</p>
<p class="contents">This organisation of the markets is actually based on a production quotas system. This entails strict supervision of the volumes produced. In addition to this self-regulation between production, importing and exporting, the producers must bear the bulk of the expenditure incurred due to this COM. The EU budget handles only the financing of the sugar exports corresponding to the preferential imports granted to developing countries which are beneficiaries of the sugar protocol annexed to the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the burden of this COM is particularly light as far as European Union finances are concerned in relation to the importance of the sugar beet sector. It is true that the corollary of this situation is a specific internal price. Throughout the debates leading up to this report, there were many participants who took the opportunity to highlight the artificial nature of the Community price in relation to the world price.</p>
<p class="contents">This criticism which has been widely expressed in various reports and media also needs some clarification. Firstly, we have to put into context any reference to a world price, since it cannot be seen as representative of the transactions actually carried out. Secondly, the objectivity which the European Parliament must display in this matter leads me to point out that, in real terms, the Community price has been in a steady decline for around fifteen years. Moreover, 75% of sugar is consumed in the form of processed products. The price of these sugar products fluctuates quite independently of the price of sugar. I should note, moreover, that such products are no more expensive in the European Union than they are in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that several studies refer to the lack of competition within the European Union in the sugar sector. Competition is specifically one of the points warranting in-depth study on the part of the Commission services within the next two years. For the time being, there is one observation that must be made. There is healthy competition between sugar manufacturers because intra-Community trade is more significant than the Commission indicates, accounting for over 30% of sugar consumption, as such, and 26% in the form of processed products.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to my last observation regarding the effects upon the Community market and the ACP countries of the decision adopted 15 days ago by the Council on the initiative for the Least Developed Countries. We have just discussed this, and this initiative too is in keeping with the European Union’s commitment to launching the round of multilateral talks, a matter on which Parliament is to deliver its opinion tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, I think that, for the ACP countries, this initiative will have significant implications, which have not been assessed clearly by the Commission. That is why both the studies which the Commission wishes to undertake in the context of a reform of the COM in sugar and the assessment it is to undertake in 2005 of the transitional phase of the LDC initiative are of fundamental importance. It must take account of the concerns of the ACP countries, which traditionally export their produce to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I wished, in the five minutes available, to share these observations which I thought important, before you declared your opinion on the matter tomorrow. To sum up, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his contribution, and I hope that this evening he will be able to expand a little upon his point of view of Parliament’s draft text. I would like to thank all the officials in Parliament’s secretarial service for the invaluable help they have given me in drawing up this report, as well as all the fellow Members who took a very active part in this draft.</p>

That is not a blank cheque, however. We believe that sugar should, in the first place, be treated as any other arable product. In 2002, the common organisation of the markets in all other arable products will be up for evaluation, and we believe that this should also apply to sugar. Should it, by that time, prove necessary to review the regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector, we will also need to establish whether there are any funds for compensating the farmers. That is, after all, what we did when the common organisation of the markets in other arable products was about to undergo far-reaching reform. Everything hinges, therefore, on the question of whether we can scrape together the funds to compensate the farmers when we give the regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector a thorough overhaul.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets does share the Commission’s view that the storage levy can be abolished. If we are to evaluate the regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector in 2002-2003, we need factual information at our disposal in order to execute this task effectively. We believe that a number of studies must be carried out, first of all with regard to the impact which the change in the sugar regime will have on ACP countries which currently benefit from preferential access rights. Which sections of the population will be hit hardest as a result? What will be the impact of a possible price cut for producers on consumer prices? Can parallels be drawn between the current situation and what happened, for example, to the price of a loaf of bread when the price of wheat was reduced? What will be the effect of a change in national quotas on, for example, a European quota system? Finally, we would like to know the actual level of competition within the European sugar market. Is there or is there not room for genuine competition? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly do not wish to address these topical problems here, but I do think that some aspects of the debate have been neglected.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am getting at is the fact that surely it can hardly be right to pillory the whole of European agriculture right across the board or to condemn wholesale the achievements of the common agricultural policy. The European sugar market policy, of all policies, has done nothing to deserve a judgement of this kind. The common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector is like a horse on the road to victory, as has also been repeatedly stressed in this debate. For many years now, consumers have been supplied with a safe basic foodstuff, and this at reasonable prices. Some critics think and claim that sugar is too expensive, however. Mr Daul referred to this, but it should set alarm bells ringing; firstly, because these critics are hardly concerned about the well-being of consumers but about their own profits; secondly, because the production of a basic foodstuff in compliance with European environmental and social standards has a legitimate price and thirdly, because, measured against consumers' purchasing power worldwide, the sugar price which we have in Europe can probably also be described as one of the lowest.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people also say that the common organisation of the market in sugar is a dinosaur. It has been in force for 32 years, since 1968, but of course it has been repeatedly adapted. That is why it is now also necessary to have a longer period of validity, of at least five years, as the rapporteur, Mr Daul, has said. It would be wrong to change the compensation system for storage costs…</p>

It responds to the needs of all sides, while remaining within the bounds of the possibilities and balances offered by the common agricultural policy. The proposals made in the report really do serve the interests of Community sugar beet and sugar cane growers in respect of their employment and standards of living. They also respond to the need for programmed production given that, as I am sure you are aware, beet is a four-year crop grown in rotation with other arable crops.</p>
<p class="contents">They also protect consumer interests in terms of both prices and quality specifications. The dates on which the current regime expires have been brought into line with the deadlines agreed in Berlin. This adjustment is extremely important not only because all the interested parties know the exact date on which the regime changes and will comply with it, but also because we have a specific offer to table at the forthcoming WTO negotiations. The system for producing sugar from sugar beet is a self-financing system. Most of the expenditure under this system is incurred from granting export refunds. The highest level of export refunds allowed by the WTO is the 2000-2001 level. It would be a tragic mistake if the EU were to change the regime before it is obliged to do so and can demand something in return.</p>

This system of quotas expires at the end of the production year on 30 June 2001, and the Commission proposes that the current system be continued for a period of two years, with certain changes of limited scope. The Commission omits to say how the period 2003-2006 is to be funded. The Commission proposes that the price be kept at the same level but that the quotas be reduced by 115 000 tons. Moreover, the compensation system for storage costs is to be abolished, together with the requirement to maintain minimum stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The aforesaid reduction in the production quota will mean that the market for sugar from the world’s poorest countries can be opened in accordance with the ‘everything but arms’ principle. That is something we are able to support. As I mentioned before, however, what is then missing is information from the Commission to the sugar industry and the sugar producers about funding during the period 2003-2006. We therefore support the Committee on Budgets’ amendments in relation to the financial perspectives in Agenda 2000, and we wish to extend the organisation of the market to 2005/2006. At the same time, however, we demand that the reform of the organisation of the market be in place no later than in 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember our debate here on the common organisation of the market in pig meat. Mr Mayer, you know that at that time I said that at some point I would remind you of the vehement opposition to this from your ranks and the calls for a free market. At the time I said that I would come back to this when we discussed the organisation of the market in sugar but of course you were also in two minds. If I remember correctly, Mrs Schierhuber in fact voted for the arrangements then in force for pigs, but now we are debating sugar and I do not think that the organisation of the market in sugar should be completely abandoned; a number of aspects simply need to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">Production must be adjusted strictly in line with consumption in the European Union. This also implies that the sugar which we take in addition to this from other countries – for example, the ACPs – is not re-exported. It is also quite reasonable for us to accept sugar from the least developed, poorest countries. I am in favour of the quantities being laid down so that we do not have cyclical trade here, however. This means that we need to repatriate our quotas. There must be no more C sugar and no more exports of sugar at farmers' expense! Because even if the money is forthcoming it is, after all, still dumping. The practice of the European Union providing public money to help out with storage costs must also stop. I am in favour of the sugar market being self-supporting. Then it should be sustained in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">One final thought: in my view there is much more that could be done in the sugar sector from an ecological point of view. Nitrogen use has fallen out of necessity because it caused sugar yields to fall, but, quite apart from this, more can be done in terms of sugar cultivation, and we can make it compulsory for the sugar factories to accept a particular proportion of eco-friendly sugar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to justify these spending cuts, an attempt is made to paint a dismal picture of the current situation, thereby paving the way for drastic restrictions on quotas, prices and farmers' incomes and, ultimately, drastic cuts in Community production.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid the social tensions which directly applying such pioneering measures would provoke, the Commission's chosen method is to apply them gradually, until such time as they can all be applied, without respite, under a new regulation to be approved and to apply from the 2003-2004 marketing year. As part of this method, it proposes to freeze nominal prices at 1983-84 levels for a further two years, thereby cutting actual prices and incomes, irrespective of the fact that the extended freeze on sugar beet prices eroded actual prices by 33% between 1982 and 1999. It also proposes to reduce quotas by 115 000 tonnes and to abolish storage so that the Community budget can save EUR 300 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals will drastically reduce the actual price of beet and farmers' incomes. Further reductions in quotas, together with similar cuts in all agricultural produce, will leave even more farmers high and dry and yet, there is not a single proposal as to what crops they should grow. Because these transitional measures form part of systematic cuts across the board...</p>

I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Daul, on his work, which I have no difficulty in supporting on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">The common organisation of the market in sugar has already undergone several reforms, including an agreement to reduce quotas by 500 000 tonnes for the 2000-2001 marketing year. In addition, institutional prices for sugar have declined continuously since 1985 by 36% in real terms. The present system has brought stability to the sector and enabled the Community to be a modest but regular exporter to world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for Parliament to put down a marker with regard to the Commission's efforts to draw back prematurely from decisions taken in Berlin, which, in the case of the sugar regime, were to remain in place until 2006. This will only undermine farmers' confidence in the ability of Europe and its institutions to bring stability to a sector already bedevilled recently by falling income and unstable markets.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a danger that the current unprecedented crises in the livestock sector – mainly BSE and foot-and-mouth – might be used to introduce far-reaching reforms to the common agricultural policy which would not otherwise have been contemplated. Instead we should direct our energy and resources to bringing stability to the sector, restoring consumer confidence in food and investing in promotion and market development.</p>
<p class="contents">Central to any future reform must be income stability for farmers. Fewer and fewer people are attracted to farming as a way of life, particularly when more rewarding work is available elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It costs billions and has led to enormous inefficiency in the allocation of the world’s sugar production. It is incomprehensible that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should wish to see the system extended to 2006, especially when the Court of Auditors has pointed out that the Commission has withheld relevant information and ought to have dealt with the issues of the economic costs of surplus production, the effects on world market prices and developing countries’ income and the impact on the environment. You do not know whether to laugh or to cry when, in Recital 2, the Commission writes that account must be taken of the interests of consumers, knowing full well that the organisation of the sugar market triples consumer prices for all products containing sugar.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of everything, that is not, however, the worst of it. What really tops it all is the fact that the failure to reform the policy on sugar has obstructed the ‘everything but arms’ initiative whereby the world’s 48 poorest countries would be given access to the EU’s market. It is an initiative which, in the worst case, would have increased imports of sugar by approximately 100 000 tons per year. It is outrageous that the EU’s farmers cannot countenance such imports when they themselves each year pump 8.8 million tons of EU-subsidised sugar out onto the world market. It is deeply disheartening for this House that Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should want to be still more protectionist than the European farming lobby. I would therefore call upon everyone who wishes to look after the interests of the developing world and of consumers to vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The world of agriculture is going through a stage with which you are quite familiar and which I therefore do not need to describe again. We, in the world of agriculture, need to know what kind of market we are supposed to be building over the next ten years. Although, on the one hand, the rules imposed by globalisation – that is the opening-up of our markets – can on no account be extended<span class="bold">,</span> on the other hand, we must also take into full consideration what is an asset and a valuable resource for Europe as a whole.</p>

I urge Parliament to think about what kind of message we will send to the European tax-payer and the farmers in the candidate countries if we roll over again, as Mr Daul proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no problem with Mr Daul personally rolling over for the sugar producers – as he is one. He can roll over as much as he likes, but this Parliament should resist any temptation to roll over the sugar regime yet one more time. Why is it that with increasing pressure on farm spending, any real chance to reform the CAP is greeted with a shrug of indifference in this Chamber? This report demonstrates how powerful the farming lobby is, although pressure for reform is mounting, not just from European citizens but also from far-sighted farmers themselves, who recognise that the current regime is clearly unsustainable in the long term. It has remained unaltered for 32 years and its highly protectionist nature has kept the EU sugar price at three times the world level, discriminating unfairly against consumers and damaging the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that the WTO and enlargement commitments mean that another roll-over would wreck the EU's international credibility. A recent Court of Auditors' report concluded that the sugar regime leads to substantial costs for the EU budget and for the consumer. So what we need is serious, well-thought out reform. The long-term ramifications of Mr Daul's plans to do nothing will mean deeper and deeper quota cuts shrinking the industry and threatening employment. We have sadly been bombarded by a series of unfounded claims on storage levy and the ACP, ignoring the fact that the money saved could actually be redirected towards other agricultural expenditure.</p>

Anyone who reads the Court of Auditors’ special report on the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar will be astonished to learn, paragraph by paragraph, about the shortcomings of this common organisation of the market. Rapporteur Daul does not breathe a word about this report by the Court of Auditors. The new European Commission, on the other hand, did. It had the courage to come up with a reform proposal and adjustments, but I notice that our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has dismissed those proposals and has instead embraced a short-sighted policy and opted in favour of short-term success. It has capitulated before the interests and the sweet-voiced lobbying of the sugar industry. It is a policy which clashes with the interests of the farmers themselves and is mainly directed at the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot endorse this report. It makes a mockery of sound financial management. The net costs of over-production in 2000 amounted to EUR 800 million, almost as much as the sum which we agreed on a few weeks ago to combat the BSE crisis. The average supply of white sugar accounts for 14% of the production quota of 2 million tonnes. That is the case, even though the Commission is of the opinion that only 0.4 million tonnes, or 3%, is necessary to accommodate unexpected shortages. This translates into an annual cost of EUR 30 million. Moreover, the consumer is faced with a market in which only five companies hold more than 50% of the EU quota. In most sugar-producing Member States, the entire national quota is in the hands of only two companies. Talk about competition! This policy is opposed to the interests of the consumer, the environment, high-quality production and the developing world.</p>

Rapporteur Daul is right to reject these plans from the Commission. Liberalisation of the sugar market makes little sense if it does not benefit the consumer. Only the soft drinks multinationals and foodstuffs industry stand to gain from liberalisation. Those who lose out are the hundreds of thousands of European farmers who grow sugar beet.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not developing countries will benefit from a market which is not protected is very much called into question. Now, a number of developing countries are allowed to export a fixed quota of sugar to the EU, for which they receive more money than on the global market. Ninety per cent of the costs incurred in the European sugar budget of EUR 800 million benefit these countries.</p>

I will be supporting my electorate, who are large sugar producers, and I will not be supporting the multinationals who are lobbying very hard. I would just say to you Commissioner that I worked on the 77 Protocol which was very much involved with helping the developing world countries. I heard Mrs Gill talking about the way in which the consumer was going to benefit. Let me make it absolutely plain to all of you here today, that the consumer will not benefit from a reduction in the price paid to British and European farmers for sugar. They certainly do not in the rest of the world where sugar is much cheaper. Why is it that I am being lobbied by the biggest single user of sugar in the world, a US company, specifically to get the price down? I heard Commissioner Lamy speaking before about trade relations with the US. Will the United States be reducing the price that they pay their farmers for their sugar as we are going to do, or are they going to continue with their very high support?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Daul, you said that the sugar regime was a special agreement. I would argue a little bit with you on that because I believe it is unique. First of all, the tax-payer does not pay for it. Secondly, it benefits farmers directly, unlike many parts of the present CAP, and thirdly, the sugar protocol itself helps some of the poorest countries in the world. It is very important that we continue to support those countries. I worked very hard to get them support and I intend to keep that support for those ACP countries. We have a saying, Commissioner, in the UK, if it is not broke, don't mend it. Please do not try to mend this system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the rapporteur's basic proposal, however, to extend the current system until 2006, in accordance with what was established at Berlin, in that I see the need to allow time for production conversion and diversification so that the, albeit necessary, measures do not lead to a drop in income for producers and cause acute social hardship in some of the afflicted areas where the product is produced. I feel that it is necessary to reach agreement on the basic proposal, and we will support this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Daul report makes a sound case for extending the EU sugar regime, a regime which, compared to other areas of policy, is very cheap for the European Union. Setting aside specific regional policy in certain parts of the European Union and the funds needed to import from a large number of ACS countries, the policy is actually financed entirely by the farmers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore striking that the costs of this policy should form the subject of another dispute. The policy is said to be expensive and cost the consumers dearly. In fact, the first argument can be refuted on the basis of the agricultural budget, which demonstrates that expenditure on the policy is mainly earmarked for the measures with regard to ACP countries and regional policy, and not for the common organisation of the market itself. As for the second argument, one cannot compare apples and oranges, and that happens whenever a small proportion of the global market, mainly a surplus market, is compared with the consumer price in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, when internal European cereal prices were brought into line with the global market, it appeared that the consumer in Europe did not in any way benefit from the lower producer prices. In terms of meat prices, too, we observe that consumers hardly notice a reduction in prices for many producers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore better to opt for a policy in which producers are given a valuable role in a tough competitive context, both in Europe and elsewhere, instead of a spurious position in the discussion between consumers and producers. But I expect that we will again be entering into this discussion during the mid-term review of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the ability of 48 of the poorest countries to access the EU market, we should do better to opt for a kind of ACP formula, rather than state before the event that a policy will be wiped out completely with this measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur very warmly because he has, in my view, succeeded in achieving a very good result in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Time and again it is said that sugar is too expensive and that it needs to be cheaper for consumers. I should simply like to refer to the BSE crisis. It shows that, although farmers are seeing prices fall by up to 30%, the consumer still pays the same price for the meat in the shops. I therefore fully support the extension of the organisation of the market in sugar until the marketing year 2005/2006. In my opinion, this is the key point in this proposal. This end date also coincides with that in the Berlin agreement, in which CAP funding is established for six years. We farmers need a policy on which we can rely. The sector's stakeholders, the sugar beet producers as well as the sugar manufacturers, need to be able to look far enough ahead to make appropriate investment decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I should like to mention the imminent accession of new countries. I do not think that it would have been very prudent to establish a new COM for only two years, as originally proposed, because this would only have caused confusion and led to uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the arrangements for storage levies are concerned, I can only fully support the rapporteur when he advocates that they should be maintained. They are an important instrument to keep the market stable and they have proved their worth over 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very short-sighted to disturb the equilibrium in a market organisation of this kind – which works perfectly – simply for the sake of reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I find it difficult to understand the Commission’s proposal to reduce the quotas by 115 000 tonnes or reduce storage aid in order to save EUR 300 million, as well as reducing time limits. I believe that these are substantial changes, which are unjustifiable. And why until 2003? I would like the Commission to tell us whether it thinks that, after 2003, there will be more resources and this provisional amendment will be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Daul on his work on the Commission’s proposal and on the special sensitivity he has shown in relation to each of the problems which we have raised, with regard to which he has been able to reach a compromise and has included them in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like this provisional amendment, tabled by our parliamentary committee, in which it opts for maintaining a system of quotas without modifying the system of prices, to be taken into account by the Commissioner and that the Commission will change its position in the way proposed by Mr Daul, whose report we agree with on all its fundamental aspects and which we are prepared to support tomorrow morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I now turn to the content. What are the most important points in the proposal tabled by the Commission? The Commission believes that a fundamental reform of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector is necessary. Such a reform can, however, only be justified on the basis of a detailed analysis. That is why the Commission has ordered two studies, the results of which are expected to be available in mid-2002. The first study will examine concentration and competition conditions in the sugar sector, but not only in this sector, also in other large sectors of the agricultural and food industries. The second study will investigate the various possible options for a fundamental reform of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission is proposing to extend the main mechanisms of the current organisation of the sugar market for two marketing years. In addition, it is intended to reduce the overall quota by 115 000 tonnes, which is 50% of the structural surplus under the WTO's export restrictions. Compensation for storage levies is to be abolished in order to increase competition and reduce the incentive to produce C sugar. This will also save the EAGGF EUR 300 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirement for producers to hold minimum stocks is to be abolished, since this is no longer justified in the light of the current supply situation in the Union. Finally, production refunds for sugar used in the chemical industry are, in the future, to be provided by the sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the amendments to these Commission proposals. One group of amendments in Mr Daul's report basically seeks to extend the current arrangements for the sugar market for a period of five marketing years without introducing the changes proposed by the Commission; this is provided for in Amendments Nos 2, 15-18, 22, 26, 29, 68, 69, 70 and 71.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to extend the current organisation of the market in sugar for a longer period than the proposed two years, but only if the remaining key points in the Commission's proposal are accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot therefore accept a series of amendments for the following reasons. Amendments Nos 3, 4, 23, 24, 31 and 56 seek to leave the basic quotas and the estimated maximum supply requirements of the refining industry unchanged. This is unacceptable because the Commission's proposal to eliminate at least part of the structural surplus is essential in order to fulfil our obligations under the WTO. Neither is the Commission in a position to accept Amendments Nos 36, 45, 57, 60-62, 65, 67 and 72-75 because they would either increase the quotas even more, cut them very, very drastically or redistribute them.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 12, 13, 19, 25, 27, 28, 30, 39 and 40 seek to maintain the compensation for storage levies. I cannot accept this either because the abolition of the compensation system will create increased competition, remove the incentive to produce C sugar and, in addition, bring considerable savings of budgetary resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6, 21 and 40 provide for the minimum stock system to be kept. I cannot take this on board either because, given the extent of the current surpluses, a requirement of this kind is not justified. Amendment No 40 expresses the wish that the EAGGF should continue to participate in the funding of the production refunds for the first 60 000 tonnes of sugar used in the chemical industry. This would seem to me to be inappropriate because exemptions can no longer be justified within a self-financing system.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 19, 14, 37 and 38 seek to make it possible once again for Italy, Spain and Portugal to grant national aid. This national aid has already been granted for too long as it is and has caused significant distortions of competition. As early as 1995 it was therefore decided to abolish it. It would, therefore, be a serious mistake if we were to reverse this decision of 1995, in the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendments Nos 33, 63, 64, 66, 76 and 77 are concerned, I can assure you that the Commission will make every effort to ensure the necessary coherence between the sugar proposals and development policy. There is therefore no need to spell this out in the proposals. Amendments such as Amendment No 20 for example, in which a derogation from the concept of a refinery is sought for the Azores, or Amendment No 36, which seeks to have quotas adjusted in order to fulfil the WTO requirements, must also be rejected. This is because our proposal already provides for an adjustment of this kind in Article 10.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to reiterate my thanks for the work which you have done and hope that you will acknowledge that, in expressing its willingness to extend the system for more than two years, the Commission is, after all, also taking an important step towards accommodating Parliament's concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
