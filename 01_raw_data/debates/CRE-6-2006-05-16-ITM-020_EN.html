<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dariusz Rosati (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Madam President, the state of public finances has a real influence on the rate of economic growth, employment and macroeconomic stability. It is also an important indicator of the health of the common European currency. This is why the Treaty on European Union clearly states that developments in the public finances of the Member States are of interest to the bodies of the Union, including the European Parliament. Exercising its powers under the Treaty, the European Parliament has once again reviewed the state of public finances in the European Union and will adopt a report on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The main message behind this year’s report is the conclusion that public finances in the majority of the Member States are still not balanced and that this situation has not improved significantly since last year. This calls for continued efforts to improve tax policy. The total deficit of the 25 Member States of the European Union increased in 2005 to 2.7% of GDP. In the eurozone it rose to 2.9% of GDP. In effect, public debt has systematically grown in the last few years in relation to GDP and by the end of 2005 rose above 70% in the eurozone. Since 2003, 11 European Union Member States have been running deficits in excess of 3% of GDP, and 10 countries have been subject to excessive deficit procedures. Most worryingly of all, four of the largest economies in the European Union, namely Germany, France, Great Britain and Italy, also find themselves among those offending against budgetary discipline rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation clearly shows that some Member States are experiencing considerable difficulties in restoring the balance of public finances. There is a lack of political will and determination to implement the necessary changes. This state of affairs also shows that the preventive and corrective procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact have not been very effective to date. One of the main reasons for this unfortunate budgetary situation has been the persistently low rate of economic growth in Europe. Failure to implement indispensable structural reforms, increasing international competition, uncertain job prospects and a lack of certainty regarding future demand mean that, for a number of years, Europe has been developing more slowly than other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy hitherto implemented has not succeeded in changing this state of affairs. An expansive tax policy and a restrictive monetary policy have produced an unfortunate ‘policy mix’ and slowed economic growth. The situation is made worse by insufficient coordination of tax policy in the eurozone. This coordination is vital in order to increase the effectiveness of economic policy and in order to maintain confidence in the common currency, which requires tax reforms to be synchronised and measures that result in budget imbalance to be avoided. One of the reasons behind the tendency towards stagnation in Europe is the insufficient progress of structural reform in many Member States, and especially a lack of action to increase the flexibility of the labour market, to promote professional activity, to remove barriers on the services market, to promote innovation and to support entrepreneurship. In this context, the slow progress made in implementing the Lisbon Strategy gives particular cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in the report we suggest a list of measures aimed at improving the state of public finances. First of all, it is necessary to adhere strictly and rigorously to the tax regulations set out in the modified version of the Stability and Growth Pact. This will help the Pact to regain credibility and strengthen its disciplinary role. We call for faster structural reform, and in particular for the decisive implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. We also propose measures aimed at streamlining fiscal procedures, increasing coordination and improving the effectiveness of tax policy. We call on the European Commission to assess the likely effect of increased tax policy coordination on economic growth in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We recommend measures to improve the quality of tax statistics, the introduction of transparent rules for the assessment of assets and future pension obligations, the taking into account of the economic cycle in drawing up budget deficit estimates and an extension of the budget forecast timescale to two years. We suggest that a single set of macroeconomic assumptions whose source could be the European Commission should be accepted as the basis for drafting the budget in the Member States. Finally, we recommend that measures be taken aimed at strengthening motivation for the implementation of tax reform by Member States, including the publication of reports on the dangers associated with a failure to balance public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures mentioned are necessary in order for tax and budget policy to contribute to faster economic growth and increased employment in the European Union. The European Parliament should send out a clear and unambiguous political signal on this matter. That is why I turn to you, my colleagues, and ask you to endorse this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have enriched this very necessary debate on how to conduct economic policy – particularly budgetary policies – so as to enhance economic growth and promote job creation, aims that we all share.</p>
<p class="contents">I must begin my brief speech with two comments that set my position apart from the statements contained in Mr Rosati’s report, probably because some time has passed and has brought some positive results. Since last year, when the Commission drafted its report on public finances, the figures in which served as the basis for the Rosati report, we have received new information both on economic growth and on the balance of spending or public deficit situation in the countries of the European Union, which improves the outlook. I should like to discuss that briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">On 8 May I had the chance to present the Commission’s spring economic forecasts and, in doing so, I was able to publicly state that, in our opinion, according to the Commission’s analysis, growth in 2006 in both the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole will approach our potential growth: in the euro zone it will exceed 2%, specifically reaching 2.1%, compared with the 1.3% achieved in 2005, and in the European Union as a whole it will be 2.3%, also clearly higher than the growth recorded in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore entering a phase of much more evident recovery than we could envisage when we in the Commission presented the report on public finances for 2005, and that in itself is a positive sign. I hasten to say, however, that it is not enough, because growing at the rate of our current growth potential is not enough to meet all of our citizens’ demands or, above all, to create sufficient jobs to produce a clear, sustained fall in unemployment rates, which are still in excess of 8%.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to increase our growth potential – and in that I agree with the ideas expressed in the Rosati report; we have to persevere along the path sketched out in the revised Lisbon Strategy; we have to continue to put the national reform plans into practice within the framework of that strategy; we have to continue reforming the product, service and labour markets; we have to correct budgetary imbalances wherever they persist, achieve greater sustainability for our public finances and, of course, improve the quality of public spending; in particular, we have to make a greater effort in all of our policies aimed at skills enhancement, research and development, innovation and education in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment that I should like to make relates to the particular subject of public deficits. The report notes that the situation worsened in 2005 and attributes that to the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact. The final figures for 2005 refute that statement; the public deficit in 2005 both in the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole was well below what we estimated a few months ago: it came to 2.3% in the EU as a whole and 2.4% in the euro zone, several points, therefore, below our forecasts at the time when the Commission published its report on public finances for 2005. According to our forecasts for 2006 and 2007, this situation will continue and, if the Member States adopt additional measures, we will see a clear improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, I do not think one can say that the new Stability and Growth Pact has been incorrectly applied, but rather that the new Stability and Growth Pact has been successfully applied to correct the excessive deficits: there were seven countries with excessive deficits of 3% at the end of 2005, compared with 12 countries currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure, which will probably leave the procedure once those improvements in public deficits are confirmed. The stability and convergence programmes, which have been approved under the guidelines and parameters of the new Pact for the first time, show a qualitatively clear improvement in the Member States’ medium-term budget strategies, with greater attention to sustainability and a greater effort to improve the quality of public finances and to link budgetary and fiscal policies with the growth strategies included in the Lisbon Strategy and in the national growth plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these two comments, there is considerable convergence in everything else between the proposals and statements in the Rosati report and the Commission’s opinions and criteria. We agree on the need to avoid pro-cyclical policies, on the need for a reorientation of public expenditure towards greater physical, human and technological capital accumulation, and on the need for greater efforts to make the Member States’ budgetary procedures more uniform, particularly in the euro zone; we obviously agree that we must place the accent on how to address the challenge of an ageing society.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that economic recovery is beginning, now that we have defined the Lisbon Strategy, and now that the 25 Member States have defined their priorities for structural reforms aimed at growth and employment, I believe – and here I share the view of this report – that we have a unique opportunity to close the door on a period of low growth, economic pessimism and lack of confidence among economic operators. We have a unique opportunity in our hands to use Europe’s institutions and the European dimension to meet the people’s demands and aspirations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supported this draft by an overwhelming majority – I would almost say unanimously. Naturally, it has also been endorsed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall naturally assess the amendments tabled critically, and so I am very grateful that the Commissioner, too, has criticised two or three aspects of these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Sound public finances are the most important aspect of Economic and Monetary Union as a whole and beyond. These are the only way of effecting a lasting economic upturn in Europe. Unfortunately, this idea is not popular with all European governments, who often lack the political will to make budgetary reforms. They have to clearly observe the criteria laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact rather than repeatedly attempting to circumvent them.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 – several of us were present at that time – these were termed ‘stability criteria’, as they lend stability to the financial area and economy in Europe. European governments should not now view these criteria as a scourge or obstacle to their development, therefore, but as a sustainable path to a healthy economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Large budget deficits have an adverse effect on economic developments. Indeed, as we have just heard, there have been some changes in this regard. Increases in these deficits only perpetuate this spiral, and it is imperative that they be stopped. Naturally, we must increase expenditure on the correct channels: on innovation and on developments with a promising future; but this does not change the fact that there is still expenditure that needs to be included in macroeconomic calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I welcome the independence of the European Central Bank – something that others have already made clear today – with regard to its interest-rate policy, which must continue to pursue price stability as its primary objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The write-down in the case of special expenditure on innovation, such as in company accounting, that has been called for by some of my fellow Members, would open the way for further new debt and weaken the European economy dangerously in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">A long-term policy of balanced public finances is needed in the current euro countries and must also be made an indispensable requirement for all future accessions to the euro area. To do so does not require the creation of any new national bodies to monitor public finances, as stated in the amendments, however, as these would only result in an increase in bureaucracy and in a heterogeneous system in a single monetary area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact and the monetary policy of the European Central Bank provide a reliable, satisfactory framework, and all we need to do is to stick to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with him that we did not claim either that this would be a case of incorrect application. That is why we have tabled an amendment to correct this wording. I would also ask the other groups to look into this. Our Amendment 7 tries, in fact, to remove this wording altogether from the text.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the statistics and prognoses, your remark that the content of the 2005 report has seemingly been superseded underlines once again how relative these prognoses and statistics are. I would also like to stress this in the light of what you said today about Lithuania, a Member State that wants to join the eurozone and in respect of which comments can indeed be made if one considers the figures. Only one figure matters, in fact, namely that of inflation, while many Member States would envy that country for its achievements in other areas of public finance. I only say this to illustrate the relative nature of the figures.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the recommendations that are issued to the euro group in a bid to improve the procedures another important element in this report. I think we are well on our way in this respect, in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy to joining forces with national parliaments and to seeing how a number of public finance procedures in the Member States can be streamlined in terms of timing, but also in terms of assumptions that are made about the oil price development and other parameters that are important for the planning of policy. I think that in this respect, there is much room for improvement in order to make this more predictable and more comparable in a European context.</p>
<p class="contents">While I would, once again, like to bring those recommendations to the Commissioner’s attention, I think it is also necessary to bring them to Mr Juncker’s attention, as chairman of the euro group, to ensure that we make serious headway there too. I think it is crucial that this be flagged in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The same also applies to the quality of the statistics. That is another important point we have raised several times, and we would like to support the Commissioner in his attempts to make improvements in that area too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to, and at the same time underline, the last paragraphs of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I would like to talk about the public finance policy. According to the Treaties this should be formed at the national level, but the stability of the common currency – the Euro – and growth in the competitiveness of the entire European Union is dependent on its successful implementation. Therefore we must determine reference points in the public finance policy which would help to reconcile the Member States' interests with the objectives of the Community. It must be emphasised that the report presented by Mr Rosati reflects to a degree the endeavour of balancing both these viewpoints, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for this. It is the ALDE Group's opinion that the following measures could ensure more effective coordination of the European Union’s public finance policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, measures of organisational nature, that is, forecasts of basic economic indicators made at the Community level, which would increase the reliability of the Member States' financial forecasts. Secondly, preparation of coordinated timetable of budgetary procedures of the EU Member States, preferably for at least two years. Thirdly, we would encourage public statements and transparent obligations of the Member States’ governments, proving that they are striving for fiscal balance, as this would ensure public supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures of an economic nature, which we would support, first of all include the need to define a European macroeconomic policy which is outward-looking and competitive. In this respect there could be more coordination in ECOFIN Council meetings. Appropriate tax initiatives, which stimulate modernisation of the economic structure and citizen activity, should also be a priority. The third priority should be the fostering of fiscal discipline, based on the best practices of the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">We use this method rarely, but some countries have actually achieved rather good results by solving fiscal administration management problems, and the Commission could prepare a report or document summarising the best examples, instead of shall we say, reproaching one country or another all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth measure is extremely important – we believe that attention should be turned from encouraging private investments to encouraging savings, as this is one of the basic macroeconomic initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time has come to rethink the level of priority that continues to be attached to the monetarist, neoliberal policies of the Lisbon Strategy and to the guidelines of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">No matter how much the truth is muffled, it cannot be denied that the monetary and fiscal policy based on the Stability and Growth Pact and the priority attached to price stability has a negative impact on economic growth and employment growth, a phenomenon that has been evident in Portugal. What is therefore needed is a monetary and fiscal policy that will boost economic recovery and help combat unemployment. Furthermore, the Stability and Growth Pact should be repealed and replaced with a proper social development and progress pact.</p>
<p class="contents">We emphasise the need for an expansionist policy coordinated jointly by the EU and its Member States, which will be aimed at strengthening internal demand, public investment, research and education, high-quality public services in areas such as health and housing, including infrastructure and equipment, which promotes high rates of employment with rights and which guarantees economic and social cohesion and balanced environmental development.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that these are some of the vital proposals that will also help us gain the trust of EU citizens. Without that trust, we will certainly continue to live in this atmosphere of pessimism arising from policies that do not address the problems currently facing people in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Maastricht Treaty clearly stated that the course followed by public finances in European Union Member States should be carefully monitored at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">The main and most pertinent point of this year’s report is the unbalanced budgetary positions in the majority of Member States. Four of the largest EU economies, France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain, are among the countries subject to excessive budget deficit procedures. The basic causes of the problems are still an excessively slow rate of economic growth in Europe, as well as failure to implement the structural reforms required to strengthen public finances for the future. The rate of economic growth in the European Union is significantly slower than its potential would suggest, and significantly slower than that of other global economic powers, such as the United States, Japan, China or India. The reasons for this situation also lie in the low level of internal demand and uncertainty concerning job security, social protection, salaries and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">High energy prices, unstable fuel markets and constant current account surpluses in the majority of Asian countries have all shaken the faith of many businesses in Europe. A loose fiscal policy has proved to be ineffective and has not encouraged growth in our economies. The indicators show rising levels of debt which pose a real problem, especially in terms of long-term budget stability, across the whole of the Union. The initiation of attempts to implement the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 was supposed to ensure a comprehensive programme of reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing all these problems in mind, I think that we should take decisive steps to increase the effectiveness of preventive measures, as well as implementing corrective measures to strengthen and consolidate public finances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would underline this statement, especially as the Lisbon Strategy is calling for more money and greater investment, including from public finances – I need only mention education and research. We have committed ourselves to increasing our Official Development Assistance to a minimum of 0.7% at long last, we face the challenge of globalisation, and we find ourselves in a situation in which demographic developments represent one of the nails in the coffin of the European continent. If we do not put our social security and pension systems in order, we shall be the losers of globalisation at all events.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that there has been a trend reversal in the public consciousness with regard to public deficits in recent years. Prior to the introduction of the euro, public budgets tended to be the preserve of experts. Since the introduction of the euro, of the Maastricht criteria, of the Stability and Growth Pact, there is a public interest in a discussion on the structure of public finances, on the causes of the annual deficits, on the impact of public debt.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a reduction in public deficits, and we must continue on this path, as we need to increase our scope for the future. For that reason, I also congratulate the Commission on the decision it took today, as it makes it clear that we take our rules seriously. This decision is not aimed at anyone in particular, but rather at ensuring that we take the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact seriously. That is why I am pleased that the public debate has intensified and that we have thus contributed to making the structure of our budgets more future oriented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to point out three factual elements. The first is the cyclical conditions that place a strain on the public finances of the European Union. Given the rise in oil prices, this is an exogenous factor that we must take into account in our public finance strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element is, for its part, practically exogenous with regard to our public finances: I am referring to the policy of the Central Bank and, in particular, to the policy of raising interest rates on which it has embarked.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element is undoubtedly more political, and is also an aspect that my political group holds dear, namely that the plea that some people make for structural reforms without accompanying it with a strategy for boosting growth is likely to fail, as there can be no structural reforms without genuine support for growth. That is why I should like to point out two lines of action that I consider to be absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The first line of action is an investment strategy to help genuinely implement the Lisbon Strategy. From that perspective, I am surprised that my fellow Member, Mr Karas, can, on the one hand, speak in favour of an increase in the allocation for the Lisbon Strategy and, on the other, be getting ready to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the financial perspective as it is proposed to us in the compromise drawn up between our institutions. I believe that there is an inconsistency there for which I hope our fellow citizens will not have to pay a heavy price tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The second line of action concerns the issue addressed by Mr Rosati at the end of his report with regard to the conditions for growth and coordination of economic policies within the eurozone. A large number of commitments have just been made under the responsibility of the President of Eurogroup, with the Commissioner's agreement. I believe that we are on the right track, particularly with regard to the harmonisation of the timetable and of the macroeconomic data on the basis of which the Member States evaluate and draft their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, we still have a great deal left to do and, to that end, I believe that work carried out between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament should make it possible in the coming months and weeks to come up with practical proposals that would enable the European Union to have a eurozone that is more in line with the kind of prospects for growth that we have a right to expect from having a single currency in our favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the sanitising of public finances cannot be an aim in itself, but must be a means of generating higher economic growth and creating new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, measures taken in this field by the European Union Member States are unfortunately not yielding satisfactory results, as is reflected in the falling rate of GDP growth from 2.4% in 2004 to 1.5% in 2005. This fall has been even more marked in the eurozone: from 2.1% to 1.3%. Unemployment has remained high at around 9%. These indicators confirm that the European Union is not only failing to catch up with the United States and other developed countries, but is actually falling behind. Here we should add that GDP growth in the United States stood at 3.5% in 2005 and was therefore more than twice as high as in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a low level of economic growth and continuing high unemployment make significant reductions in budget deficit and public debt difficult. In the European Union of 25, the budget deficit has fallen from 3% of GDP in 2003 to 2.6% of GDP in 2004 and from 3% to 2.7% in the eurozone. However, public debt rose from 61.4% in 2002 to 64.1% in 2005. In the eurozone it rose from 69.2% to 71.7%.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as the figures above show, budget deficits, and public debt in particular, are significantly higher in the older Member States than in the new, and yet it is unfortunately to the latter that the warnings and recommendations of the European Commission are mainly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the new Member States are implementing very difficult reforms based on fundamental changes to pensions systems. In spite of moves from a budgetised system to a capitalised system, as has been the case in Poland, for example, the European Commission (Eurostat) wants to treat the contributions to this system as budgetary spending which increases the budget deficit. It thus, in fact, wants to punish these countries for implementing far-reaching reforms of their public finance systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to voice my strong objection to this manner of dealing with the difficult reforms being implemented in the new Member States, especially Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my speech tonight, I should like to focus on the relationship between public deficit and economic growth. The Commissioner has provided us with more up-to-date information. Despite that, I would dare to regard the European Union public deficit situation as worrying: 2.4% on average is better than 2.9%, but it is still worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the European Union – Europe – is the region of the world, including the less developed parts of the world, that is achieving least growth at a time of international economic expansion. Thus Europe is not keeping its own house in order and it is not doing what it ought to be doing in terms of balancing the international economy.</p>
<p class="contents">That has a great deal to do with the public deficit situation, as other speakers this evening, such as Mr Karas and Mr Hoppenstedt, have pointed out; they have said that, in a European economy afflicted with a lack of domestic demand, public deficits are a cause and not an effect. Therefore, I have to insist that we must improve the European Union’s mechanisms in order to improve confidence and, in the last analysis, so that income levels in the European Union grow. It has the ability to do so, but its problem is that its growth potential is so terribly low, incomparably low.</p>
<p class="contents">We are the area of the world with least growth potential, and that is where the problem lies. That can be solved, in effect, through structural reforms and also, of course, through public finances that have been straightened out by means of political willpower to contain public spending to the point where it becomes sustainable, so that European citizens can pay reasonable, modern taxes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report begins by stressing that the EU’s main problem is weak economic growth, the persistently high level of unemployment and the inadequate use of the production capacity in place. This, in my view, is a crucial message.</p>
<p class="contents">The first signs of recovery that you mentioned, Mr Almunia, are not sufficient either to guarantee the EU’s competitiveness on the international stage or to make up for the years of stagnation that we are still enduring. Indeed, balancing public finances must not be seen as an end in itself. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that neither the way in which the Stability and Growth Pact has been interpreted nor the opening of proceedings relating to excess deficit has been successful in preventing persistent imbalances in the public finances of the major European economies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main recommendations that, to my mind, emerge from this report: The first relates to the need to ensure that the balancing of public finances is entirely compatible with the process of revitalising European competitiveness, and that this process is pushed to the top of Europe’s political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The early shoots of growth have emerged in spite of, rather than because of, the Pact. Public and private investment must be increased in the fields of innovation, education and the development of new skills and technologies, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy. Intergovernmental cooperation and the coordination of economic policies at EU level are key factors and are currently not being sufficiently exploited. It is also regrettable that this priority of growth has not been sufficiently reflected either in the interpretation, as mentioned in the Pact, or, more importantly, in the financial perspective that we are supposed to be adopting tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the need to continue to clarify the accounting concepts and practices of the Member States’ statistical institutions, that is to say, disseminating good practice, and harmonising concepts, timetables and methodologies. Maintaining sound public finances is only of interest if it is sustainable in the medium term, which often means taking measures of a structural nature. It is time for economic operations based on extraordinary measures or creative accounting to disappear for good, because they undermine credibility and erode the trust of investors and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, public finances must be consolidated, but it is only worthwhile doing so sustainably and provided that this goes hand in hand with the strengthening of the European economy and the skills of its citizens. I feel that these are the two key messages to take from the report before us today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the report by Mr Rosati on public finances in Economic and Monetary Union is an extremely important one, as it rightly draws public attention to the fact that, in the present situation, the Member States are responsible for EU finances and also for the resulting debt for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right to address his appeal to the Member States. However, in my view, he occasionally goes too far – I should like to expressly endorse the words of the rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Hoppenstedt, in this regard. I take the liberty of drawing attention to a further point. In 2007, Germany’s budget deficit will be below 3%, and consequently we shall meet the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. Indeed, Commissioner Almunia said so himself in appropriate terms. The development of Germany’s economy will thus give the EU as a whole new momentum – or at least that is my hope.</p>
<p class="contents">The chief concerns are well known, and so we need increased coordination of economic policies, particularly by Member States, so that individual Member States are not able to push up costs for the whole economic zone. I should like to refer once more to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, which considered the state of the European economy during the last part-session, with Parliament’s concern being the development of an intelligent growth strategy for Europe. I believe that we have not yet gone far enough down this route and that some work remains to be done in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the rise in oil prices, inflation remains stable, and even consumption in the EU is at a level that could certainly be called acceptable. For this reason, we do not need pessimism, but rather action, particularly with regard to the improvement of the economic climate and the further integration of the internal market. In this respect, I hope that the report by Mr Rosati also points the Commission in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Supervision of their public finances is essential to ensure that their commitments, which are greater in the euro zone, are fulfilled and that our shared aims are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Rosati, because his report identifies the main problems with public finances and provides valuable guidelines for treating them and improving their future course.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is worrying but, as the Commissioner has said, the turning point may have been reached in 2005. Until then, the public debt ratio had done nothing but rise ever since the euro had been brought into circulation. There are still five members of the euro zone subject to the excessive deficit procedure and, indeed, growth in the European economy is lower than in the most advanced countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the success may be due to the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, because it has introduced some rationality. Defining medium-term budgetary objectives, while taking into account each country’s situation, its cyclical conditions and sustainability status, provides a more consistent fiscal environment and better incentives for structural reforms to raise growth potential.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that budgetary procedures have a uniform calendar, respond to common economic parameters and are based on uniform assumptions that improve statistical governance. It is also necessary to use a cyclically adjusted budget concept, as the rapporteur proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not seem that public investment should be subjected to greater rigidities than private, and it is therefore reasonable that the Council should look into authorising investment for purposes specified in the Lisbon Strategy, to be amortised over a similar time period to business accounting, and it is also important to make progress on sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Along these lines, I consider it important for national reports to be drawn up on the sustainability of public finances, based on common elements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe there is quite a considerable level of agreement and consensus on the diagnosis and on the main guidelines as to what the European institutions’ response should be, so that public finances and good fiscal and budgetary policies can help to produce more growth and jobs and more effectively meet European citizens’ demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, in recent months there has been a significant improvement in confidence and optimism among economic operators and also among European consumers. All the indicators point to that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the process of trying to convert this confidence and optimism into real evidence of an upturn in the economic situation, with more consumption, more jobs and more economic growth. I believe we are partly succeeding, although that does not mean it is an easy task. There is of course a problem – and I agree with those who have pointed it out as one – with the low potential growth of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European economy by itself, without further reforms, is incapable of growing any more than the figures that we are estimating for 2006, namely slightly more than 2%. There is evidence of some extraordinarily dynamic competitors, both in other industrialised countries and in emerging countries; there is a risk, which some of you have mentioned, arising from the fluctuations in energy prices; there are global imbalances in other important areas of the world economy that may affect this phase in our growth. When we find that we have the answer to the question of what to do in this situation, we have a relatively strong consensus: good fiscal and budgetary policies, which are not pro-cyclic, which are anti-cyclic, which improve the quality of revenue and expenditure, and which contribute better to growth and skills enhancement; better operation of the internal market; use of our enormous potential as a market of 450 million consumers; and, as we have all mentioned, the need for better coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Having witnessed the monthly operations of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN, I have to agree with all of you when you call on the Council, and the Eurogroup in particular, to provide more coordination. I can also tell you, however, that the Council and the Eurogroup are willing to improve their coordination and to improve the involvement of all sectors and all the institutions – including this Parliament, of course – in the dialogue needed for this coordination to set the right objectives and priorities and to be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are facing a very good opportunity at this turning-point, which Mr Sánchez Presedo mentioned a few minutes ago. We must not let this opportunity slip away, and we must not fail to learn from the mistakes that Europe’s economies and the euro zone made in the previous period of economic recovery, when they failed to make use of the good periods of economic growth to consolidate public accounts and thus improve sustainability, or to use the dynamism of their economies to provide more and better jobs, which is what our citizens are demanding of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However large the deficits run by Member States as part of their overall debt, their ratings are not affected appreciably. There is an implicit guarantee for countries within the euro area, irrespective of what is said about countries’ borrowing not being guaranteed by other countries in the euro area. My view may be summarised in three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries newly set to enter the euro area must hold referenda before they introduce the euro. It is important that people be made fully aware of the real implications of changing their currency. They must appreciate the consequences of having a fixed exchange rate and of not being able to conduct their own monetary policy. The example of Sweden shows how important it is to have referenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, new countries that have public debts in relation to GNP more than 60% in excess of GNP should not be approved. This rule has not so far been applied stringently enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a proportion of new countries’ state borrowing should compulsorily be from the long dollar market, involving for example ten-year bonds. This should of necessity give rise to a rating without a corresponding implicit guarantee from the EU countries. I believe that such dollar bonds would provide a more accurate picture of the countries’ economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
