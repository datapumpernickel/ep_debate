<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gasòliba i Böhm (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I have the honour of representing, could not have come at a more appropriate time. This report is based on the one drawn up by the European Commission, assessing the first four years of the euro and also, as has been pointed out, on another report on the use of euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has been introduced in a very short time, but has proven its solidity and stability. The European Central Bank and its President, Mr Duisenberg, must be congratulated on the euro’s sound management and we must thank him, in his last appearance in plenary, and extend our best wishes for the future, hoping that he enjoys them in the company of his grandchildren, who have only known the euro as the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro, its increasing acceptance and its appreciation towards the dollar, inevitably lead us to consider its role at international level, which is the main theme of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Thessaloniki European Council, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, stated that working on the external representation of the euro is absolutely crucial. The report attempts to respond to this need articulated by President Prodi, and proposes principally that the euro should have a single representation in the international financial institutions, and also that this representation should be enhanced at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not go further, because we believe that there must be a broad consensus and, obviously, the relevant arrangements in line with this principle must be studied and adopted in the appropriate international forums. There is a suggestion, however, made by Mrs Peijs, to be specific, before her appointment as minister in the new Dutch government, which is to use the type of post that has already been adopted and proposed by the European Convention, of a European Minister for External Affairs. The same could apply to a Minister for European Economic and Monetary Affairs who would, at international level, represent the euro on the basis of a formula contained in a proposal from Ecofin, which the Commission has obviously accepted. This ‘Mr Euro’ or ‘Ms Euro’ would also hold the post of Vice-President of the European Commission. I repeat that this is a suggestion, for a post that has already been adopted and proposed in the Convention, and which appears to be accepted at political level, even by the European Council itself and we therefore believe it to be a valid alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">In an article that appeared recently in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, Martin Wolf said that the Eurozone will very soon be larger than the dollar zone and attributes this to the credibility and soundness of the economy and of the economies that are joining the Eurozone. Obviously, this solidity and credibility are the result of complying with the stability and growth pacts, which it is absolutely crucial to pursue and abide by. We refer to this aspect – compliance with and the need to comply with the stability and growth pacts – as a component and guarantee of the euro’s soundness, credibility and stability, and we study, as one would expect, the use of the euro at international level in various fields and, in particular, on the international financial markets, and its use by our new neighbours, including Russia and the Baltic States. We also refer to the euro’s potential for ensuring greater stability in the supply of raw materials which are extremely important, because of their dependence on the European economy. We believe that energy supply should be paid for in euros. We also refer to the growing number of central banks around the world that are increasing their euro reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I shall simply recall that in the report we also study some suggestions and propose a study to be undertaken by the European Central Bank and the central banks that are members of the euro zone, on some aspects of the use of notes and coins, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has already referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to focus my comments on two fundamental points made in this report. One of them concerns economic policies, while the other relates to problems of an institutional nature, to which he has paid rather more attention. With regard to economic policies, at Thessaloniki the new Broad Economic Policy Guidelines were adopted and we hope the Ecofin Council will formally adopt these at its next meeting. The guidelines maintain the tone set by the Commission, including some of the comments made by this Parliament in the report presented by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the proposal ratifies the broad lines on which we are all working: sound macroeconomic policies, which are crucial to increasing demand, growth and employment and to increasing the potential for growth, on the basis of the Lisbon conclusions. This implies a need to press ahead with policies of modernisation and structural change, and our main challenge at the moment is to set up and implement these policies. That is where I believe Parliament must play a crucial role, in this aspect of implementing policies, through its dialogue with the citizens and with the national Parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">As to economic governance, I wish to make two comments; firstly, the Eurogroup has played and continues to play a fundamental role. In our opinion, the recognition of its role in the Constitution should be welcomed, since this maintains its informal character. Nevertheless, the Commission regrets the fact that the idea of creating an Ecofin Council for the Eurozone has not been accepted. We believe that there is a whole set of formal decisions that must be adopted publicly by the countries of the Eurozone and that the existence of the Eurogroup is nevertheless not sufficient to resolve these problems. We welcome the fact that some progress has been made in the decisions that the Eurozone countries are to adopt, including in the framework of the current Ecofin. There are, however, some requests made by the Commission that have not been accepted and we do not believe that this will help the system to function more smoothly. Decisions such as those on the excess deficit procedure, the procedure of multilateral vigilance in the Eurozone or on the entry of Member States to the Eurozone should, in our opinion, be adopted, not by the Council in plenary, but by the Council that deals with the Eurozone. This point will continue to be debated and I hope that we can make progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a final comment on the issue of external representation. At the Thessaloniki European Council, as Mr Gasòliba i Böhm has just said, emphasis was given to the importance of increasing the Union’s ability to act as a coherent and unified force in the international system. The need to respond more effectively to the challenges of globalisation and economic interdependence was also underlined. The effective and coherent representation of the Eurozone in this way is crucial. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that beyond raising the issue, little progress has been made on external representation.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the progress that has been made has basically been better advance coordination of strategic positions at international meetings, which has enabled us in several cases to put forward joint proposals, but not one common proposal. We must make more progress in this direction. I take note of your suggestion, which is not far-removed from another suggestion the Commission made to the Convention. We must be aware, however, of the technical, legal and institutional difficulties that the issue entails and in light of these, I believe it is crucial to demonstrate enormous political sensitivity, in order clearly to define what we want to achieve in future. For this reason, we in the Commission will continue to work with the Convention, trying, in the corrections to the final texts, in the part which is still being debated, to clarify some points. In any event, at the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission will attempt to put forward a vision that is more ambitious and even innovative, which will enable us to consolidate effective external representation of the Eurozone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate is a seamless continuation of the previous one. I believe that we should view all the arguments as a whole and not as an alternative to the report of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Right at the beginning of his explanatory statement, the rapporteur wrote the following: ‘Since its more than four years of existence, the euro has become the world's second leading currency’. The first reason, he says, is the size of the euro area economy, which accounts for around 16% of world GDP, in comparison with the United States' 21% and Japan's 8%. The second reason he refers to is the stability and growth orientation and economic and monetary union. Whilst his reasons are sound, these are of course also areas that we need to approach with great caution.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro area is growing. Since its inception we have already gained an additional member, Greece, and we must do our utmost to ensure that the Member States of the European Union are not divided into a eurozone and a non-eurozone, because the euro can make the single market our home market, and because we must do everything to strengthen the single market, to be better able to influence global political events and thus to increase the benefit to the Member States. This involves the new Member States meeting the Maastricht criteria, it involves strengthening the euro area, and it also involves adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact and the communitarisation of national economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be our objective for all the Member States of the European Union also to be members of the euro area, because only then can we fully exploit the potential of the single market and the single currency. However, this political objective presupposes political will on the part of the Member States and compliance with the criteria. In Paragraph 11 we have very clearly spelt out what is necessary to achieve this, that is to say achieving the Lisbon strategy, promoting a culture of entrepreneurship, stronger small and medium-sized enterprises, creative and innovative fiscal reforms, with protectionism outlawed and research and development promoted. If we can stick to what we have agreed we can then make the euro area even stronger, both internally and externally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This phrase consists of congratulating the rapporteur on the report they have drawn up. I would not like my congratulations to Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, in this case, to imply that I am simply observing a Parliamentary formality.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate Mr Gasòliba i Böhm in particular, not only on the content of his report but also, above all, on his good choice of issues. Parliaments sometimes earn prestige not only by what is said within their walls but also by their choice of issues for debate: if these are topical and affect the citizens, they serve to bring the citizens and their political representatives closer together. Like Mr Karas, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for his flexibility towards the positions of the other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro is one of the most significant milestones in the process of European integration. Having a single currency represents a huge step towards achieving European unity, not only in economic terms, but also, I would say, in political terms. The Eurosceptics are right to fear the single currency, because no one can question the fact that participating in a common currency involves the greatest possible degree of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, therefore, think that the introduction of the euro has been important only in the economic field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the euro has enjoyed considerable success in the field of foreign trade: around one third of trade with third countries takes place in this currency. Furthermore, as we Europeans continue to use the same currency, we will start to feel more united with one another. For this very reason, it is the political and human dimension of the euro’s introduction that we should be worrying about – the ‘micro’ effects of the new currency. Concern about these effects, which citizens sometimes see as negative, obliges us to remedy them, inasmuch as we can, or, when this perception is not borne out by objective causes, to try to convince the public that its opinion does not match the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">This success cannot conceal the fact that there have been problems in introducing new notes and coins. Blame for this must be laid at the door of the Commission, the governments and European Central Bank; there may still be some issues that make citizens feel that some problems are the result of the euro’s introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the euro’s introduction cannot conceal some of its effects, which have damaged public opinion. In this context, the citizens’ perception is perhaps that the euro has played a major role in increasing inflation and in raising prices. The reality, however, is that, according to objective data, the euro has had much less influence than the citizens perceive to be the case. There is some basis for this perception because the so-called ‘rounding-up effect’ has had a fundamental impact on consumers’ shopping baskets and other essential goods, and on certain services. The necessary steps must, therefore, be taken to prevent this perception, which can have such damaging effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last thing I would wish to do is interfere in the internal debate of those countries that have not yet decided whether to join the Eurozone. I must remain on the sidelines of this internal debate but whilst remaining on the sidelines, I can still express the desire for them to join our common currency zone as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the introduction of the euro has been very successful. We have finally obtained a practical common European symbol. The euro is already the world’s second largest currency. It has strengthened European identity and bound the twelve countries together. Even if economic development is shaky, the euro has already shown positive economic advantages, strengthened trade and increased investments for the eurozone countries.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aspects, which was also addressed by Mr Berenguer Fuster and which has been discussed in connection with the introduction of the euro, is that of whether there have been price rises and, if so, unfair ones. Eurostat’s statistics clearly show that there was a very small, one-off effect of between 0.1 and 0.2% upon the introduction of the euro. Within some sectors of the economy, or in certain industries, there were, however, significant price rises, particularly in certain countries. The overall effect for those inhabiting the eurozone has, however, been very small. It is good that we should now take up this issue and ask the Commission to investigate it further. One thing we have found is that pro-active consumers and two-currency price labelling have prevented underhand price rises. Let us not, however, be deceived into thinking that the price rises were higher than they in actual fact were, and let us not make use of that argument in debates, either.</p>
<p class="contents">The big advantage of the euro is, however, that it has provided economic stability in politically and economically very difficult times. In spite of great unrest in the world, partly due to the Iraq war, European currencies have not tossed around on a stormy monetary sea, as in actual fact happened in the nineties. The euro has provided stability and security. That is a fact that should be mentioned more often. This should be emphasised in the discussion of the euro’s advantages and disadvantages, particularly in those EU countries that at present enjoy the stability of the euro without participating fully in the cooperation and so without accepting full responsibility, either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we can also see the limits to these benefits: the short-lived expansion phase from 1997 to 2000 and the current economic stagnation.</p>
<p class="contents">It was Jacques Delors who said that the euro was not enough. He asked for strong coordination of economic policies. We have not yet achieved this, and we are now desperately in need of a European economic policy. I approve of Mr Gasòliba’s report, which is a move in this direction, and which expresses the desire for, among other things, the development of public and private investment, of human capital, of research, and of the mobility and qualifications of workers. The Convention should have drawn up the tools to achieve these objectives. It has not done so and that is one of its great failings. We have not really been able to construct the euro group within the framework of the work of the Convention. Even though Member States could, as they say, take additional measures in terms of major economicpolicies, they have neither the fiscal nor the budgetary means to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the monetary policy which was mentioned just now, and about which complimentary words were spoken, neither anticipated nor understood the reversal in the world economy and was very late in reacting to it, which demonstrates the difficulty that we have in imagining our position within the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to talk of structural reforms – and these are certainly essential – but, as Mr Delors also said, competition is not enough: we must build up cooperation and solidarity between us if we want to have a successful economy and play a role in the governance of the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Without this willingness and these concepts, let us at least work towards institutional reforms, let us try to equip ourselves with institutional tools. You have proposed a single representation of the euro zone, and have aired the idea of a minister for economic affairs who would play a role that was at once both internal and external and who would operate as part of the Commission. Obviously I can only support these proposals, which are a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On a political level, as a federalist and a supporter of Catalan independence, I ought to be pleased at the relative success of the euro. For Europeans, the euro reinforces the evidence of the process of integration of which it is the symbol. For Catalans, whether French or Spanish, it means that we once again have a common currency, which has not been the case since the disastrous Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to admit that I am not entirely happy, however, first of all because this common currency is not as common as all that. Some people do not have any of it, or at least not enough of it. For instance, in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, some 5% of families are living in a situation of extreme poverty, in other words with an income of less than EUR 240 per person per month. Secondly, I am not entirely happy because I would like Europe to have a stronger and more human symbol of unity than a unit of currency. In celebrating the euro, are we not rather like the chosen people who, forgetting their destiny, began to worship the golden calf?</p>
<p class="contents">This earth, which has been so copiously watered with the blood and tears of our fratricidal wars, so distressingly covered with the ashes of our tragic genocides, deserves, I believe, stronger and less abstract signs of its humanity and its unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of the euro has, without a doubt, been an extremely valuable development, and not just in economic and financial terms. It is worth pointing out once again that the euro area is the second largest economic area in the world. However, the single currency has also contributed to a small revolution in terms of culture and identity, so to speak. Indeed, the circulation and use of the single currency have given consumers something practical in common and have thus helped them to feel more like European citizens for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these same citizens, who exceeded all expectations and sailed through the transition from individual national currencies to the European single currency, are now demanding that the Community institutions carry out careful surveillance to prevent unjustified – and, in many cases, very substantial – increases in the price of both goods and services. Above all, as has been pointed out in the report too, these citizens are calling upon us to introduce minor measures in the future, effective, practical measures which will make their everyday lives easier. In particular, the citizens are calling upon us to introduce EUR 1 banknotes or even, in some cases, 50-cent banknotes, as well as for greater availability of low-value notes, especially in cash machines. I believe that these demands are absolutely legitimate and very reasonable too. I also believe that it is genuinely important that Parliament makes every effort to persuade the relevant Community institutions to comply with the demands of the European citizens, which, although small, are extremely important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we can be a little more precise than that: the real advantages exist and have, moreover, been known from the beginning. For example, the disappearance of fluctuations in exchange rates between countries in the euro zone, which has no doubt saved us from a few crises in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the disadvantages exist too. These can be found, in particular, in a growth rate that has halved and an unemployment rate that has doubled in the euro zone compared with the non-euro zone. No doubt there are several reasons for this difference, but one of those reasons is very definitely the inflexibility resulting from uniform interest rates and exchange rates, when these are applied to economies whose needs remain very different.</p>
<p class="contents">Another disadvantage, which rarely occurs, is the lack of incentive for structural reforms, which is the result of making responsibilities mutual. Previously, poor national management could cause a monetary crisis, which would require corrective measures. Now, the responsibilities of saint and sinner countries are blurred, thanks to the single currency, so that certain parties can put off reforms as long as the euro still has credit. Admittedly the plan was that the disappearance of the disciplines of the exchange market would be compensated for by the disciplines of the stability pact, but it has now been proved that these administrative disciplines are not enough to replace those of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the strengthening of overall economic coordination and a European budget drawn up in accordance with federal principles, which the report calls for, we must not count on these too much in the immediate future, as is shown by the somewhat unsatisfactory results obtained on this chapter in the Convention. Moreover, it would not be in accordance with what was agreed at Maastricht. In other words, Madam President, the ship of the euro zone is afloat, but it cannot be piloted, and no one knows where it is heading. I hope it is not heading towards a superstate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, as we know, the euro's exchange rate has followed a roller coaster course. At present, it has returned to its starting point. But, basically speaking, we Europeans should not be too concerned about the euro exchange rate, because no one can explain or even predict short-term exchange rate fluctuations between one day and six months. We should instead be focussing on economic problems, which are more important, and leave exchange rate trends to the foreign currency markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if public acceptance of the euro has increased, the most recent polls carried out by opinion research organisations indicate, for example, that in many Germans’ thinking, the Deutschmark is still very much alive. That this should be so was, however, totally predictable and should by no means be seen in a negative light. The increasing public acceptance of the euro is a gradual process and can in no way diminish the impact of this key event in monetary policy in the history of the continent of Europe. As far as withdrawals from cash machines are concerned, I support the rapporteur's view that we need more smaller-denomination banknotes, that is, 5-euro and 10-euro notes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, rather more critical about the idea of setting up a working party to investigate the need for a 1-euro banknote. The most recent opinion polls confirm that in Germany at least there is widespread opposition to this idea. There, for example, 79% of the population clearly rejects this low denomination note, with only 16% in favour of introducing it. Even if opinion polls are not the be-all and end-all, this result nevertheless seems to clearly confirm that the public, at least in Germany, does not see any need for such a note. In short, the answer to the question ‘Do we need a 1 euro note alongside the 1 euro coin?’ is very definitely ‘no’. The euro denominations currently in circulation are fine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of the single currency was a huge success, but although the new notes and coins have brought with them widespread satisfaction, the same cannot be said of the processing of payments in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has actually been our currency since 1999. For four and a half years the euro has been the currency of 11 Member States, whose national currencies became nothing more than submultiples still in circulation. Throughout this period, however, the European banking system persistently refused to recognise this new state of affairs. There were 12 countries with the same currency, but the banks carried on operating as if each country in the zone were financially autonomous. The euro payment zone did not really exist. It was not until a year ago that electronic banking cards could be used all over the euro zone as well as in the countries in which they were actually issued. It was not until this week, moreover, that it became possible to carry out bank transfers under the same conditions as those that apply within each Member State. Furthermore, while this is an extremely beneficial step for citizens and for small and medium-sized enterprises trading in the euro zone, the limit of EUR 12 500 per transaction is ridiculous and unjustifiable. Since the technical infrastructure allowing single-currency transfers from one country to another is in place, and since the cost is negligible, this being a virtual transaction processed by computers, why has such a low limit been set? A EUR 12 500 transaction costs the same as a EUR 50 000 transaction (which will be allowed from 2006), or a transaction of EUR 100 000 or more. I would go as far as to say that forcing a company to perform 10 small transactions of EUR 12 500 in order to make up one payment of EUR 125 000 only serves to increase costs for companies and banks.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I will state my conviction that the euro zone must be made to work effectively by reducing banking commissions to the rates charged at national level. Do not forget that the euro zone is our country where currency is concerned. What does the Commission plan to do to improve the processing of payments in the euro zone? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro is not only a means of payment. Instead, it is part of an economic policy and an important key element of EMU policy. If the euro is to function, a lot of things are clearly required. Mr Gasòliba i Böhm indicated a number of them in his report, and other factors were also addressed in the debate. Much more harmonisation and coordination of economic policy is required. Mr Gasòliba I Böhm goes so far as to talk about federal budgetary principles. What is required is coordination on tax policy, a structural policy and greater mobility for the European labour force. In short, a range of measures may be taken to reduce the large differences that exist between national economies. For example, it would be possible for Ireland and Germany to have the same policy – two countries that, at present, quite clearly have a need for different policy approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gasòliba I Böhm talks about the need for institutions. If the matter were to be summarised, there could even perhaps be talk of the need for a European state power in the economic sphere. He proposes having an economics tsar when it comes to the eurozone’s relations with the surrounding world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely all this that gives rise to such a lot of scepticism towards the euro project in my own country of Sweden. We fear it would mean the small economies being integrated into a European economy in such a way that they would be unable themselves to exercise control and that would not offer any democratic guarantees, either. There is therefore considerable hesitation, and more than half of the Swedish population will presumably vote ‘no’ in the forthcoming referendum. That is also why the Swedish referendum will be followed with such great interest in the candidate countries. So far, only 12 of what will soon be a total of 25 Member States are in the eurozone. The 13 countries that are still outside it have obvious doubts. People are aware of the ups and downs of the German debate and of the problems there are, and they think it is better to wait.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate, however, that there may one day be a need for lower denomination notes, especially if economic problems were to arise in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In purely practical terms, it is now clear that the introduction of the euro has been extremely successful. The latest Eurobarometer indicates that 75% of citizens in the eurozone countries are satisfied. Mr Gasòliba i Böhm certainly draws attention to a number of unnecessary price rises upon the actual transition to the euro but, overall, we now know that these were fairly modest and that they have since become less pronounced. It is quite obvious that we can anticipate the eurozone in the future creating conditions for lower price rises, which is perhaps what is most important of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless think that the most interesting thing about this report is the observation that the euro is in the process of becoming a world currency, together with the demands for a feasibility study designed further to strengthen that role, for we can see how the dollar even now dominates in the world at large. In particular, international trade, especially in oil and other raw materials, has for a long time taken place in dollars. Use of the euro and its importance as a currency are increasing all the time, however. I believe that, in the future, the euro may very well be able to compete with the dollar as a world currency. If we could achieve this, it would be important from both economic and political points of view. There is a lot to be said, for example, for the possibility of one day fixing oil prices in euros. I know that my colleague, Mr Goebbels, is among those who have addressed that idea in various reports. It would be in the interests of the oil-producing Gulf States because more and more of these countries’ goods are imported from the eurozone. It would also, however, be in the interests of European consumers because the price fluctuations we have for oil and petrol, dependent upon the rate of the dollar, would disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, the debate is fully under way prior to the autumn referendum on introducing the euro. I believe that the prospect of the euro, together with an enlarged EU and EMU, possibly offsetting US power and the dollar’s world dominance is one of the most important factors that could make the Swedes vote yes in the referendum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One can also conclude that the euro, which is over-valued, is starting to amplify the difficulties of our economies, namely the sluggishness of growth and of internal demand, the handicapping of our exports, the threat of deflation, and a dogmatic stability pact which imposes a procyclical budgetary policy. Who will dare to put a figure, in terms of jobs, on the cost of the single currency and the delays and excuses of the European Central Bank?</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, which serves as your model in so many fields, should also serve as a model in matters concerning economic and monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve has other things on its mind than how to beat an inflation rate that is little more than 2%. The United States preserves its growth, which is already considerably more dynamic than ours, by issuing dollars. It uses them to finance not only its deficits but its wars as well, and it also uses them as the basis for its political domination.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should we not do the same with the euro? The rapporteur states that the advantages of the single currency far outweigh its disadvantages. That is merely a profession of faith, and the faith must be translated into reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
