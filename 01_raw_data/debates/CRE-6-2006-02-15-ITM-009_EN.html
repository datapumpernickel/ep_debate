<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans Winkler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that, since the Dayton peace accord, there has been great progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina towards the creation of a multi-ethnic democracy, and this is something that we should welcome, and in which we should rejoice. Speaking, indeed, as an Austrian, and therefore as someone who saw this going on so to speak over his own back fence, I can say that it seems to me of the essence that we who, ten years ago, watched in horrified fascination the incredible savagery and warfare and the people’s suffering, can today say with some satisfaction that there is only slight likelihood of an armed conflict there. The international community, but most of all the European Union, can chalk that up as a great success.</p>
<p class="contents">The beginning of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and Bosnia-Herzegovina testifies to what has been successfully achieved over the past ten years, one important example of which was evident at the end of 2005, when the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska </span>and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation merged their defence ministries, transferring all defence functions and staff to a single defence ministry for the whole state, which was without doubt a milestone in the country’s development. The European EUFOR Mission, ‘Althea’, works closely together with these new joint structures and continues to move defence reform forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">There are yet more examples of how this state is moving forward in terms of its integrity and acceptance of responsibility for itself, one of which I shall mention being the introduction of VAT throughout the state with effect from 1 January this year.</p>
<p class="contents">One quite fundamental step forward in reform was the agreement on the reform of the police, which is now in the process of being implemented, and anyone who has observed and followed these negotiations will know how difficult they were and just how much internal resistance remained between the state’s ethnicities. Overcoming these obstacles is without doubt a major achievement, and one on which Bosnia and Herzegovina are very much to be congratulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s police mission – the EUPM – in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have a major part to play in this reform process. It was as recently as 1 January this year that its mandate was extended for another two years, after the original mandate had expired. It is tasked with providing even more proactive support to the police in their contribution to the fight against organised crime, and that is of relevance to our own Member States in view of the fact that organised crime in our neighbourhood does, of course, have an impact on us. EUPM, EUFOR and the High Representative/EU Special Representative cooperate closely in this area, with the aim of guaranteeing the executive authorities coordinated, consistent and effective support.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent months have also seen efforts being made towards the possible reform of the Dayton constitution. Whilst this constitution is constantly criticised for being over-complicated, it should not be forgotten that – as I mentioned at the beginning – it has made it possible for peace to be established in the land, so that there is no longer a risk of hostilities breaking out.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the negotiations that were started last year and resumed at the beginning of this one have now been adjourned <span class="italic">sine die</span>, with the leaders of the parties unable, for the present, to agree on a complete package, it has to be said that progress has been achieved, and we can expect it to bear tangible fruit in the future. In particular, I would remind your House of the progress made as regards human rights and the reinforcement of the position of the Chairman of the State’s Council of Ministers, which does give cause for a certain optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">This reform process, which includes reform of the constitution, is a process rather than an event at a single point in time, and we must all take a realistic view of it; after all, there are many things that are difficult to do in a democracy in an election year, particularly if the desired objective is fundamental reform. In its conclusions in January, the Council affirmed that it welcomed the discussions on constitutional reform and the progress achieved thus far. The theme running through all these efforts, and also the role played by the international community and the European Union, is the need for the institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina to accept more responsibility, and one can sum that up in the word ‘ownership’.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue that will occupy us in 2006 is the future of the High Representative and the presence of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That this state will continue to need international aid for the foreseeable future is not a matter of doubt, but the aim must be to replace the international community’s ‘push’ – embodied above all in the High Representative’s all-embracing prerogatives, the so-called ‘Bonn Powers’, by a ‘pull’ exercised from Brussels. As part of the transition from having the office of a High Representative as it is today to having an EU Special Representative, the international actors’ prerogatives and capacities for intervention will need to be reduced in line with the concept of ‘ownership’, which involves the transfer of additional powers and responsibilities to the institutions of the State.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be glad that this is in line with the declared objectives of the new High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, who took over from Lord Ashdown at the end of January, and who has said that, as High Representative, he wants to adopt more the role of a ‘facilitator’ and make the country more European, and make less use of the powers possessed by the High Representative as such, which he will have to use less and less as the reform process goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome, then, his statement that he intends to have recourse to his powers of intervention only under exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the other Balkan countries, it is the stabilisation and association process that provides the framework within which Bosnia and Herzegovina will be prepared for incorporation into the European structures. The initiation of these negotiations, and with them of the negotiations on treaty relationships with the European Union, constitutes an important step in the Bosnia-Herzegovina’s movement closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first round of negotiations, held on 25 January under the joint chairmanship of the Commission and the Bosnian negotiator Mr Davidovic, was completed successfully, and further progress, which it is to be hoped will be achieved soon, will of course depend on how far this reform process can be moved forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of Austria has today already referred to the Western Balkans as a priority for Austria’s Presidency, and it is one, along with holding out to these countries the prospect of membership of the EU, because such a prospect is the driving force behind the reforms that these countries need and which we want to – and must – promote. It is vital that such reforms should involve progress being made in the most diverse areas, that is to say in combating corruption, in reinforcing public administration, in full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia – the last being particularly important for all the countries in the region affected by it. That same progress will be needed in many other areas where the reforms necessary in order that Bosnia, Herzegovina and all the other states in the region may become modern and democratic, are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the prognosis now? The outcome of the EU-West Balkans summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003 was that the European Union reiterated its commitment to a European perspective for all the states in the Western Balkans. This fundamental affirmation that the future for these countries lies within the European Union was reinforced and confirmed by the June 2005 European Council. Progress in this pre-accession stage will of course be dependent on the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria and of the conditions included in the stabilisation and association process.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication on the future pattern of relations between the EU and the states of the Western Balkans as presented by the Commission at the end of January this year and warmly welcomed by the Council, maps out the pre-accession steps over and above the Thessaloniki Agenda, and I am sure that Commissioner Rehn will give your House an extensive report on them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intended that the EU’s objectives in this respect should be reaffirmed on the occasion of the forthcoming informal meeting of EU and Western Balkans foreign ministers in Salzburg on 10/11 March, when agreement should also be reached on how and by what means the EU can deepen its involvement in the region. This meeting should provide a good opportunity to agree on practical measures to promote stability, security and prosperity in the Western Balkans through the region’s progressive incorporation into the European structures, with the Commission communication to which I referred earlier serving as the principal basis for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying what I have said before, namely that this is an important priority for the Austrian Presidency. This ‘high-level event’ with the Western Balkans as its theme will, we hope, further motivate and encourage these countries in proceeding with their reforms and with their integration into the European structures.</p>
<p class="contents">We take a confident view of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s future, to which the European Union can make a considerable contribution.</p>

I very much look forward to working together with the Presidency, the Council and Parliament to achieve the next important steps to bring the western Balkans closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Bosnia and Herzegovina is genuinely at a crossroads today. Last November the country started to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union. A new High Representative/EU Special Representative, Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, has succeeded Lord Ashdown in Sarajevo. Mr Schwarz-Schilling will make less use of the executive powers and leave more tasks in the hands of BiH politicians. We are now in an era of increasing Bosnian ownership and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I outline some recent developments and our policy goals, let me apologise in advance if I have to leave the House before the end of the debate today. I am scheduled to leave at 4 p.m. this afternoon with President Barroso on a three-day round trip of six cities in the western Balkans, ending in Sarajevo on Saturday. So I hope we will be finished by 4 p.m.</p>
<p class="contents">Bosnia and Herzegovina is making its way through the stabilisation and association process. Last November in Sarajevo we officially opened the negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement. The first real negotiating round took place at the end of January 2006. It went very well and our Bosnian partners had prepared themselves thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s working hypothesis is that negotiations will take about one year. However, meeting this target date will entail Bosnia and Herzegovina being able to respond to all the EU reform requirements. In this respect, it is essential for Bosnia and Herzegovina to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. In order to avoid any misconceptions, let me make it clear that there is no short cut: full cooperation is a necessary condition to conclude a stabilisation and association agreement and to make progress in negotiations. It is also essential to implement the agreement on the restructuring of the police forces, to adopt and implement all necessary public broadcasting legislation and, not least, to ensure sufficient legislative and administrative capacity to implement the agreement. We thus have a very clear message: Bosnia and Herzegovina should seize the opportunity that it has at hand. For this, reforms need to continue with the utmost determination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to say that the international community has played an important role in supporting the reforms in the country. But credit is also due to the local authorities, which have been able to achieve significant progress in what, to say the least, is a rather complex environment. We hope that progress will continue and that local political ownership will increase further. We are ready to support this process fully. The international community will adapt its role to these evolving circumstances of more local ownership. The more the country is able to demonstrate maturity and political ownership, the less the international community will need to intervene. I met recently with the new HR/EUSR, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, who shares this view on a new role for the international community and the use of the Bonn powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the ‘Dayton Constitution’ is another important challenge before the Bosnian political leaders. The country needs a constitution that ensures full compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights; allows effective decision-making and efficient governance; and makes the government structure less costly for ordinary citizens and taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, it is necessary for the country to develop a democratic, functional and affordable multi-ethnic state in order better to serve all its citizens and to support the reforms that EU integration entails and necessitates. Therefore, I welcome the recent efforts by the leading political parties and political leaders to find practical and workable solutions to these very important challenges. I encourage political leaders to continue their dialogue so as to achieve more ambitious results. We do not expect a constitutional revolution but rather an evolution. Constitutional evolution has to be a consensus-driven process with the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly in the driver’s seat. The international community can act as facilitator; we can offer encouragement and support; but the Bosnian politicians must take the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">The constitutional evolution is not as such a condition for concluding the negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement. But we need to underline that the European Union clearly has a big stake in this process. In other words, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to make sure that its constitutional provisions guarantee full and effective implementation of the stabilisation and association agreement and thus pave the way for the country’s road towards Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to engaging with the European Parliament again on a future occasion on the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

<p class="contents">That having been said, I would like to follow the President-in-Office in stressing just how considerable their achievement has been. They now have a home affairs minister and a minister of defence; they have a single system for Value Added Tax and have – on paper at any rate – embarked on the reform of the police. Contrary to what is widely believed by our own countrymen, Bosnia-Herzegovina is not a hotbed of criminality. The country’s clear-up rate for crimes is higher than would be expected in the EU, and the incidence of ordinary crime is lower there than it is in our own countries. We have not just cooked that up; it is evident from the statistics, and it is something for which I think Bosnia-Herzegovina deserves all credit.</p>
<p class="contents">The new High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, has intimate knowledge of Bosnia-Herzegovina and will, I am sure, be pro-active and very understanding in supporting local politicians, and will not have recourse to coercive methods, in the shape of his ‘Bonn powers’. The President-in-Office spoke of acceptance of responsibility, and that will be increasingly in evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, though – and I am addressing the Commissioner when I say this – that he will need support from the Commission, particularly involving it helping with the creation of jobs, setting in motion the real agriculture policy that the region has long been waiting for, and real attention on its part to the development of rural areas, for a free trade zone is of no use to the country unless it can produce its own food. That will also entail refugees being at last permitted to return to regions such as Posavina in order to repopulate them and make the fertile soil reusable again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bosnian politicians, too, must at last get started on the institutional reforms that will make ethnic division a thing of the past and build a functioning state for which accession to the EU will be a real possibility. Their cooperation with the tribunal in The Hague is an indispensable requirement; there has indeed been progress, but I cannot imagine there being real and complete reconciliation unless Karadžić appears before it.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement are progressing well, and in that we rejoice; a delegation from the European Parliament will be travelling to Banja Luka this summer to discuss progress with our opposite numbers there. We wish the Council Presidency and the Commissioner every success in supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a good thing. It is encouraging and deserves our total respect and admiration. </p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to find a country anywhere in the world with as complicated and demanding a state structure as that of Bosnia and Herzegovina and this makes their achievements and their progress all the greater. I am truly delighted with this and we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the efforts of the politicians and the impetus of the citizens of Bosnia and Hercegovina and we salute their determination to make even more rapid progress. </p>
<p class="contents">Ten years after the massacre in Srebrenica and the cessation of hostilities with the signing of the Dayton Accord, it is high time that the constitution of the country was modified and that the kind of state, cantonal and local administrative structures were restored that will help rather than hinder Bosnia in the adoption and implementation of the laws and practices that we are familiar with in the European Union. They should be building more on the rights of individuals, of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (and tomorrow citizens of the European Union), and less on affiliation to religious and ethnic groups. </p>
<p class="contents">In this respect Bosnia and Herzegovina can expect a demanding transition period and we all have to help the country during this time – the Commission, the Council and, at this time in particular, the incoming High Representative, who should use his own powers less while encouraging the state agencies of Bosnia to take on more responsibility and jurisdiction. </p>
<p class="contents">The reduction in the military presence in Bosnia and the transfer of the control of the mission from NATO to the EU is clear and convincing evidence of progress in this direction. However, without full cooperation with the Hague tribunal we cannot move forward. Just as Serbia and Montenegro has until the end of the month to find and extradite Mladić, so Bosnia and Herzegovina, or Republika Srbska to be precise, must extradite Karadžić – this is a prerequisite for forgiveness and reconciliation. </p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware that the road to the European Union will demand more than anything else improved multilateral relations and respect between all neighbours. Christian, orthodox and islamic civilisations lived in peaceful coexistence in Bosnia and Hercegovina. They spoke the same language and understood each other without difficulty. Now three different languages are spoken there but they can still understand each other and there is now increased and better communication between them. </p>
<p class="contents">With the recent problems with the cartoons it is right and proper that we remember the painful history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Perhaps this will bring us down to earth and perhaps we will then amend the visa regime more easily and with greater urgency.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That testifies to wisdom and reliability, and, as we have heard again today, the Council and the Commission are also standing by their own commitments, but – and this is something that we all, repeatedly, join in emphasising – progressive integration into Europe will depend, above all else, on progress in the individual countries themselves. Ten years on from the Dayton Accord, there is a desperate need for change in the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the country’s status, and so we are glad to hear that the newly-appointed High Representative, Mr Schwarz-Schilling, believes that his most important task is to make his own role redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible for democracy to put down roots and develop in the long term only – and Mr Winkler emphasised this today – if it is underpinned by being owned by those who live in a given place. This has a lot to do with acceptance of one’s own responsibility, not only for the past, but also for a shared future. External support on the way to this goal is a good thing and may well continue to be needed for some time, and the EU must be aware of that, not least in its financial and structural decision-making. What we do not want, though, is for constitutional changes and administrative reforms – urgently needed though they are – to be forced through by bilateral agreements entered into at haste. The risk then is of a second Dayton, or rather of what would be a Washington Accord, under which local people would take on no responsibilities whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">As Bosnia-Herzegovina draws closer to Europe, its civil society, which still too often faces hostility from every side, will need to be reinforced. There is a need for dialogue between the three ethnic groups as equals, and discrimination in access to education, employment and housing needs to be done away with. It is the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina themselves who will need to work towards these goals, but they will need our support in doing so, and today’s resolution is intended to help make sure that they get it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Bosnians in the middle and North-West, the Serbs in the North and East and the Croats in the South-West all need a model of government that protects their own identities. Moreover, the Serbs and Croats, which together form a majority of the population, need open borders with Serbia and Croatia, the neighbouring countries with which they have historical ties.</p>
<p class="contents">The best solution for sustainable peace and conciliation between the three nations is probably a federal structure such as that in Belgium or Switzerland. That is why my group argues in favour of solutions from the bottom up, in which the outside world does not try to know better, but helps in the reconstruction, conciliation and transfer of knowledge of good administrative practice. What Mr Winkler and Mr Rehn have said fills me with confidence that this viewpoint is being taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel, though, that the emphasis in the proposed resolution is too much on a different type of approach which fits in with the regrettably widespread opinion in Europe that, since the 1992-1995 war, Bosnia-Herzegovina has remained a violent and intolerant chaos for which an external solution must be found with military means and administrative interventions until such time as a strong leader appears.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the solution. We fear that in a possibly unitary state, we would see a permanent struggle for power with regard to the question which ethnic group would take control and who would assume a subordinate role.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, Muslims, Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs have taken it in turn to rule over the others. Strong national leadership leads to ethnic politics and discrimination, neither of which is desirable. That is why my group makes its vote for the compromise resolution conditional on the approval of our two amendments in which we speak out in favour of the ability of the nations in question to decide for themselves and against continuing external military interference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in south-eastern Europe is a precarious one: negotiations have begun with Croatia; Macedonia is a candidate, although negotiations have not yet started, and Kosovo remains a problem. That being so, it is indeed important that we should not close our eyes to the problems that remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or forget that they are there.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to solve these problems, we can only do so together, and ‘together’ means the ethnic groups, the people, the political authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the international community, represented in particular by the European Union. As has already been said several times over, the existing constitutional – or rather institutional – framework is not up to the job. Not only is it not up to the job of getting Bosnia and Herzegovina into the European Union, but it is also not up to the job of solving the present problems in the country itself, for spending some 50% of the country’s money on maintaining its institutions cannot be described as making any real contribution to its political and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Simply changing the institutional framework, though, is no use at all, of course. We must also, and particularly, insist on cooperation with the International Criminal Court reaching its ultimate goal, which is that those who are responsible for war crimes or are suspected of committing them should end up being put on trial. People cannot think about other important current problems until that is done.</p>
<p class="contents">One pressing problem is, of course, the overall state of the country’s economic development, with its lack of jobs and of investment, one of the consequences of which is that many young and educated people leave, so that its future elite, its future leaders, irrespective of their ethnic origin, are not there.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it an absolute necessity that this cooperation by all the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, irrespective of their ethnic origin, and involving the international community, should result in a new constitution and in institutional reform, so that ethnicity should be replaced as a criterion by the personal qualities and professional expertise of the persons who are to be elected to shoulder political responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone who experienced the war in Bosnia or who followed the events in the Balkans during the Nineties knows that the Dayton Agreement had one task, namely that of bringing the war to an end. It was incredibly important immediately to terminate the conflicts and prevent the country from being forced to experience another winter of war. Moreover, no one believed that the solution offered by the Dayton Agreement was perfect. On the contrary, there were many who believed that it was not good at all. The Dayton Agreement should probably be regarded more as a result of international efforts than as a desired compromise between Bosnia’s various political leaders. Since then, the peace agreement has, it is true, led to Bosnia retaining its territorial integrity. At the same time, however, Annex 4 to the agreement stated that the country should consist of two parts: a federation between Bosnians and Croats, and a Serbian part called Republica Srpska.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years later, we note that the consequences of the Dayton Agreement are such that it is difficult for Bosnia to operate as a normal European country. There is therefore no point in our even talking about the hundreds of ministers or the cumbersome state apparatus. In my opinion, the main problem is that the Dayton Agreement has led to a situation in which ethnic interests, rather than those of the individual citizens, take priority. In that way, the Dayton Agreement has concluded the work begun by the nationalist parties during the first post-Communist election in 1990. These parties still wield more or less absolute political power and share a more or less pronounced ambition to rule over a certain territory populated by a particular ethnic group. Therein lies the difficulty of agreeing on an economic or political future for all citizens. Therein too lies the difficulty of agreeing on a president or on systems of education or customs duties. The ethnic dimension has become, and remains, more important than the civic dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I was born, and grew up, in Bosnia and I experienced the war in that country. I am absolutely convinced that, just as when the Dayton Agreement was concluded, Bosnia must receive the practical help it needs from the international community. This excellent resolution may be the first step in the EU’s strong commitment to this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These highly complex decision-making processes have been and still are to a large extent geared to preserving peace and to fostering cooperation between the three national communities.

<p class="contents">Bosnia-Herzegovina has at last embarked on the task of amending its constitution, because that is necessary in order that it might draw nearer to the European Union. In January of this year, there was a very serious situation when, this very stage having been reached, an American think-tank tried to push this change through suddenly without European involvement. This was at a time when Paddy Ashdown’s mandate had already ended and Mr Schwarz-Schilling’s had not yet begun. That sort of thing must not happen again. I am optimistic that Mr Schwarz-Schilling, as High Representative, will have the interests of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina at heart and will take their own responsibility seriously in ensuring that our political objective has a chance of being achieved. By that I mean that, ten years on from Dayton, ten years on from the European Union’s military intervention, he will see to it that ethnic division is brought to an end and Bosnia and Herzegovina are enabled to face the future together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot do other than rejoice at the end of Lord Ashdown’s liberal dictatorship, which marginalised religious leaders among others, and look forward to Mr Schwarz-Schilling taking a more sensitive approach to arranging the country’s affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main issues with which we in this House will have to get to grips. The first, to which reference has already been made, is the process of reshaping the constitution. The country is at present an unequal federation, and unworkable in the long term, with the Bosnian/Croat Federation dominated by the Bosnians, the Serbs and their <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span>, and the Croats of Herzegovina, who keep themselves to themselves, but the ones who really are marginalised are those Bosnian Croats who can scarcely find a place for themselves in this scheme of things. That is why this structure will not work, even with the excessively bureaucratic addition of cantons. What is urgently needed is for the reform of the constitution to bring about a symmetrical federation of all three ethnic groups, and it must at the same time prune the cantons and the bureaucratic superstructures that make it impossible for the country to be run efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The second significant aspect is one that I have already mentioned, namely the faith communities and the absolutely fundamental part that they play in the country. A lot has been said here about Islam. When Bosnia became Austrian, the Austrians set up a public body for Muslims, and it is worth noting that it still exists in Austria today, making Austria the only EU country in which there is a representative organisation for Muslims that Muslims themselves accept as such. That is all tied up with Bosnia. There is also the Reis-ul-Ulema in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, which, along with other institutions, is important as a manifestation of a European Islam, and the Christian faith communities in this country, represented by such outstanding personalities as Bishop Komarica, should also be actively involved in the peace process and accepted as legal entities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In no other part of Europe are there so many fresh graves, so many parks and stadiums which are now cemeteries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this resolution, which I wholeheartedly support, is so necessary and relevant. A year ago I became convinced myself that the prospect of European Union membership is making this ill-fated country calmer and better. This is a path, which Bosnians, Serbs and Croats must follow even more resolutely, to return to peaceful co-existence under new conditions and to consolidate this institutionally.</p>
<p class="contents">EU support along this path has been and will continue to be particularly significant. Twenty years ago the inhabitants of this country were able to travel freely to both the East and the West. Now the citizens of small Bosnia and Herzegovina are fenced in by visa barriers. These must be torn down by both Sarajevo and Brussels. In particular, I would urge the Commission to make sure that young people are able to study at universities in EU countries, to become acquainted with Europe, its experience in reconciling nations, which were once deadly enemies, and the multi-faceted nature of European culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A complex institutional structure means that the political decision-making process is not transparent, while expenditure on administration at all levels is a considerable burden on public finance.</p>
<p class="contents">Positive factors, such as relatively good economic growth and reforms in police, defence and taxation matters, should not obscure the fact that without fundamental constitutional reforms, it is difficult to be positive about the future for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The European Union bears a special responsibility in this regard. The negotiation of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement that began in January is an effective step in the right direction, since the prospect of integration with European structures will reinforce the move towards essential political, institutional and economic reform. I am quite certain of this.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to say that I am strongly in favour of progress in the negotiation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement not being made conditional on progress in the constitutional reform process. The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are counting on a better future with close relations with the European Union. We cannot allow this prospect to be threatened by internal political or ethnic strife.</p>

Today, more than sixty years later, the wounds of that civil war are still healing in certain towns and corners of Spain, a war which, from an ethnic point of view, cannot be compared to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and was very much easier to explain.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this so that some people may have a slightly better understanding of the enormous difficulties involved in true reconciliation, the reconciliation that is needed between people, between families, in the streets and towns, particularly given that the peace is purely military, or at the beginning was a purely military peace, an enforced peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bosnia process is therefore exemplary. It is absolutely exemplary given that in such a short space of time we should have a country in peace and with a project for the future, one that is unstable, but a project nonetheless. But it is clear that Dayton cannot be the definitive solution and we must therefore clearly support the constitutional transformation in order to resolve all of the loose ends that Dayton left outstanding, which may have made sense at the time as a temporary solution, but which clearly do not contribute to creating a common political project.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we must support: the creation of a genuine common political project amongst everybody which must include — and in this regard I agree with something that was said a moment ago — young people, and the young people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and their relations with Europe, and we must therefore make the flow of students between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Union very much easier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Likewise I welcome the progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina towards a European perspective.

Ten years after Dayton we now also want to see more of Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has offered Bosnia and Herzegovina the credible prospect of full membership and real progress but this is increasingly dependent on political will and the quality of decision-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself.

I find myself unable to disagree with any of the interventions that have been made; the opinions you have expressed show that the Council and the Commission are on the right track, and we appreciate your support.</p>
<p class="contents">I can do no other than agree with what Baroness Ludford had to say. When we today criticise the structures set up by Dayton, we should not forget that Dayton was the starting point for peace, and for that we must be grateful, that we must acknowledge – even if, of course, we must now admit that those structures are not ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost everyone who has spoken has referred to one of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s current problems being its bureaucratic superstructures, but, while there is no doubt about that being so, let us not forget what motivated their creation. They were put in place in response to the mistrust that had prevailed between ethnic groups, which did not trust each other and wanted – and had – to keep tabs on what the other was up to. Further to what the honourable gentleman from Spain said about his own country’s civil war, the same was true in this case: we must not forget that these ethnic groups had done terrible things to each other.</p>
<p class="contents">To the degree to which we are able to reduce this mistrust and promote the mutual understanding to which Mr Peterle referred, we will succeed in changing structures, for I do not believe that it would be right to attempt to do that from the top downwards while such mutual trust is absent. We in the European Union must ensure that this mistrust is diminished and we must do what we can to help that happen. We must do something practical to help European values prevail in this country, and I do of course endorse what has been said about its young people. We must do something to support them, such as making it easier for them to travel abroad, and part of the package that the European Union will put together for them will of course consist in making it easier to obtain visas.</p>

<p class="contents">We should all be satisfied with the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement, which has got off to a very good start with Bosnia and Herzegovina, although we have to recognise that there are still many challenges for the country to tackle. It is about implementation, implementation, implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we all agree that Dayton put an end to the war, but it is certainly a less suitable framework for a properly functioning state and therefore we have to see ourselves as partners in the constitutional evolution in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have stressed the need for economic development and I fully share that view. That is why we put forward several proposals in the Salzburg Communication concerning economic development, trade and investment. In our pre-accession assistance we are already moving from reconstruction to economic development. In the communication we are proposing the setting-up of a regional free trade agreement to replace the current 31 bilateral free trade agreements, in order to encourage trade and investment and thus production and job creation in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I fully agree with those who underlined the need to work towards European accession in the present or next generation, which is why the Salzburg Communication includes proposals concerning visa facilitation and scholarship schemes.</p>
