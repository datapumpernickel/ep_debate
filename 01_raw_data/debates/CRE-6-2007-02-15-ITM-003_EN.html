<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cristobal Montoro Romero (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Investment Bank, the report we are debating today falls within the framework of dialogue between two European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This dialogue is producing positive results, as demonstrated by the presence of the European Parliament, in a spirit of cooperation and appreciation of the important work of the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been working on this report for months. We began on 20 June of last year and that work also involved our visit to the headquarters of the EIB in September.</p>
<p class="contents">Also fruitful has been the work we have carried out with the various political groups, with all of those that have tabled amendments. We reached an agreement on the inclusion of those amendments with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, with the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and with the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. I would like publicly to thank those groups for their willingness to cooperate. This made it possible for the draft report to be approved unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 23 January.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB is doing a good job, and we take a positive view of it, within the context of a year like 2005, when the European economy was relatively stagnant and we had the sense that the structural component of our economy, its growth potential, was, in relative and comparative terms, lower than that of the other developed regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important approach to take when assessing the EIB’s economic actions. Those actions, ultimately aimed at enhancing the European Union’s physical resources in the form of infrastructures, make it possible to improve the Union’s growth potential. The new approach, which has been present in the EIB’s activities since 2005, geared towards small and medium-sized businesses – which unquestionably form the European Union’s backbone – is another positive approach, which we welcome and which will be implemented accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the main focuses of its action, that is to say, to promote the European Union’s economic and social cohesion, the Innovation 2010 initiative, the protection of the environment, the development of the trans-European networks and the contribution to the European external cooperation and development aid policy, have been carried out in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report we introduce a first suggestion, which is to question whether the EIB has sufficient resources to implement such ambitious policies. As a public Bank, the EIB is comparatively small when compared to the public Banks of the countries making up the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the principal objectives, we advise the EIB to continue working particularly in the least-developed regions, with a view to promoting ‘catching up’. We also recommend that it focus its investment efforts on those less developed regions, on projects relating to innovation and the knowledge-based society.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report also emphasises – of course – energy, the energy components, improving the security of supply and the freedom of the market. The EIB can contribute here as well. Also with regard to the funding of the trans-European networks, which are absolutely crucial — as I said earlier — to the structured development of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to foreign policy, we appeal to the EIB since we believe that the volume of loans granted to Latin America is insufficient, compared to external activities in other regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the methods for intervention, we welcome the intensification of cooperation with the Commission on programmes that are already underway. We are pleased with the volume of resources allotted to small and medium-sized businesses, and we would insist that this is a fundamental aspect that we must continue to improve in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also stress the improvement in access to information and the transparency of operation, which the Bank is clearly improving. The report contains a positive assessment in this regard and also encourages the bank to continue with that transparency, genuinely subjecting its accounts to the Basel II criteria and, through better communication of its work, to provide its users with better information, beginning with the European Union’s financial intermediaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the enlargement of the European Union involving 10 countries in 2004 and completed on 1 January of this year with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, with the greater interdependence of economies and within a context, in 2005, of budgetary fragility in most of the Member States, the European Investment Bank represented, in the year covered by this report, and still represents today, a fundamental instrument for responding to the ever-increasing funding demands to be met by the European Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is demonstrated by the new instruments implemented within the Union’s budgetary framework for 2007-2013, or the extension of the Bank’s external mandate approved by the Ecofin Council a few months ago. Notable amongst those instruments are the risk-sharing finance facility, which will enhance private sector investments in research and development through greater access to the Bank's funding, the guarantee instrument for the trans-European transport networks, or the contributions to the cohesion policy by means of the JASPER programme, in cooperation with the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, and the JESSICA programme, in cooperation with the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Investment Fund, integrated into the EIB group, will increase its contribution to the Union’s objectives thanks to its involvement in the new European competitiveness and innovation programme, and also thanks to the increased opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses to access funding within the context of the JEREMIE programme, in conjunction with the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In the external field, the main feature of the European Investment Bank’s new external mandate is that it is being brought more into line with the Union’s external action priorities. In this regard, the Bank’s resources for action in the Mediterranean, by means of the FEMIP and in the neighbouring countries, by means of the new investment fund, and the tripartite agreement for action between the Commission, the EIB and the EBRD, have been strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB will also have greater resources for acting in areas such as Latin America and Africa. All of these developments are taken up in Mr Montoro’s report and the Commission sees them as extremely important and positive. They are all evidence of the central role played by the European Investment Bank in achieving the Union’s objectives and the constructive spirit of dialogue prevailing between Parliament and the Bank is therefore very good news.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only add for my part, as Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Investment Bank, the Bank headed by Mr Maystadt, that cooperation has been excellent, and I hope it will continue to be so. I am sure that it will. And I am sure that this cooperation between Parliament and the Bank, between the Commission and the Bank, will make it easier for us to achieve our common objectives — those of the Commission and Parliament — for the future of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to praise the European Investment Bank’s activity. In the course of 2005 they made more than 50% of their own loans accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ two thirds of the European labour force. I hope the JEREMIE programme, which has recently become operational, will reach its goal, namely, easier credit for micro, small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the JASPERS programme will be of great assistance to Member States in the preparation of major projects. Of the three JASPERS regions covering the twelve new Member States, only the Warsaw centre has been inaugurated. Hopefully, the other two regions will also soon be activated, but I still cannot understand what the second region’s centre is doing in Vienna which is not even part of the programme, instead of choosing cities perfectly suitable for the tasks and concerned by the region’s activity, such as Budapest, Prague or Bratislava.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of harmonising industrial objectives with environmental ones, Europe is not doing badly, though there is still work to do. In and of itself, one could even rejoice in the fact that 30-35% of bank loans were invested in projects targeting improvements in natural and built-up environments. However, 60% of these loans ended up in urban projects while only 20% remained for improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to eliminate differences at Member State levels in the field of energy, the cooperation of the banking group is indispensable. Let me cite my own country, Hungary, as an example: according to the findings of Eurostat, of all the Central and Eastern European countries, the Hungarian State spends the least on energy saving and energy efficiency measures. Until 2013, a mere 10 billion Forints, as compared to the magnitude of 100 billion for gas-price subsidies. So we still have things to do together to improve the situation. Finally, I congratulate the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like, however, to highlight the positive view that Parliament has once again taken of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and in particular its governance model.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB has managed to enhance the quality of its activities while strengthening both the transparency of its operations and the openness and the loyalty with which it deals with other institutions, particularly the European Parliament. From time to time the EIB makes commitments to improving the quality of the services it provides and to meeting new interim targets as part of its fundamental mission; it has always succeeded in meeting these strategic objectives. We now hope that the EIB once again responds positively to the suggestions and recommendations made in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is very important that the Bank’s financial activities continue to be geared towards support for projects aimed at promoting energy efficiency and at developing renewable energy sources, with the Bank committing itself to attaining even higher levels. It must also be capable of significantly increasing support for economic and social activities outside the EU, namely in Africa, Latin America and in the Mediterranean associated countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report says, the EIB cannot and should not compete with private intermediary financial institutions, when those institutions are ready and able to finance projects. It is essential, however, that the institution remain committed to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy on growth and employment and that it fulfil the specific, practical responsibilities arising from this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital to strengthen its activities in funding infrastructure and in supporting the most vulnerable areas of manufacturing, which is now made up of the thousands of SMEs that operate in the European market and that create a substantial proportion of the jobs. One of the EU’s key missions is to foster economic and social inclusion and, as the Union’s financial institution, the EIB has a key role to play in achieving this objective. These are probably the most important messages that Parliament can and must use this opportunity to convey, given that support for the Bank’s activities and judgments on their quality are not, on this occasion, at issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate the President of the European Investment Bank, who is here today. He represents the largest investment bank in the world. The EIB has a very good reputation, and the EU can be proud of the important role it plays on the world stage by virtue of this Bank. This is partly thanks to President Maystadt himself and his communicative role, whose influence is felt in the political sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">My role as rapporteur for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – the key programme for innovation in Europe – has shown me how crucial the role of the EIB is for innovation. In the shape of JASPERS and JEREMIE, the Bank has launched further instruments to help it really build on innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw how the EIB also played a key role in reaching a compromise on the budget by virtue of the ‘Risk Sharing Finance Facility’ – I have to use these English terms, unfortunately – so warm thanks for this as well. We could not have adopted our budget without the Bank’s contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add, however – and this also goes for my fellow Members from Mediterranean countries – that we should pay more attention to innovation in the field of cohesion, too. Merely supporting cohesion will not help in the context of a Lisbon Strategy based on innovation. We must ensure that the focus of all projects is on innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB should also explore new paths. I should like to raise the issue of patents in this regard. Europe has very few patents compared with the USA, and, in particular, very expensive patents compared with China. In this context, the European Investment Bank could play a key role in funding patents for small and medium-sized enterprises. A conference was held on this subject recently, at which the EIB was represented via the European Investment Fund. The EIB and the EIF voiced their strong support for this, as did Parliament, but the Commission was a little hesitant. We must go down this route, however, if we are to raise awareness of innovation among SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn to the major issue of energy. I am delighted that the EIB has already assumed a prominent role in an issue that will be huge in coming years. The Bank supports a multitude of projects, particularly in the field of pipelines, and will continue to be crucial here in future, as our energy strategy can only be realised if the Bank retains an active, leading role in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention the issue of projects outside the EU. The rapporteur calls for an increase in the funds for Latin America. This alone will not do. We must make it possible for the EIB to provide financing anywhere in the world where European strategic projects are being carried out – such as Beijing airport. This is of paramount importance to us Europeans. The EIB should be the anchor point of the European support landscape, and it is Mr Maystadt’s job to ensure that this is the case. The relationship between the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Council of Europe bank) must also be clarified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bank’s <span class="italic">raison d’être </span>is the promotion of business. New opportunities and tasks are emerging for the bank in European Union energy policy and in the Lisbon Strategy spheres of growth and employment, especially employment, where financial support has not been allocated for the tasks proposed. I would like to commend the bank’s decision to change direction in its policy on funding projects from quantity to quality; this will require more analytical work, but will definitely be better for the development of competitive business. The European Investment Bank’s refusal to participate in funding the Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, which has been viewed in conflicting lights, can be seen as a highly considered decision not to get involved in projects which weaken solidarity within European energy policy. The bank’s mission is and remains to foster the European Union’s economic and social cohesion. I endorse the request made in the report, with regard to economic and social cohesion, that the bank should concentrate on the least developed regions – Objective 1 regions. The bank has not always done this in implementing its loan policy. The bank’s activities to promote the inclusion of the least developed regions in the knowledge-based economy, and its endeavours to develop financial instruments that can be used to support small and medium-sized enterprises are especially to be endorsed. I welcome the fact that the bank has taken on the role of financial catalyst in the financing of Europe’s communications networks. In attracting private capital the bank’s participation in the financing of the connection of cross-border energy networks will be particularly important, where the complicated financing procedure makes it difficult to attract private capital. At the same time the bank could play a greater part in attracting private capital to various investment projects, by offering increased opportunities to assess investments in connection with projects in which the bank is participating or plans to participate. The development of the bank’s structure has not fully mirrored the European Union’s enlargement process and, as the report indicates, the bank has no permanent delegation in the Baltic Sea region. I agree with the request put forward in the report for the bank to improve its communication policy and to translate the main information on the bank’s website into all the European Union Member States’ languages.

All the major groups voted for it. The rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero proved open to all suggestions, including ours. This unanimity in our committee is a clear illustration of Parliament’s complete satisfaction with the European Investment Bank’s (EIB’s) attitude to us since 1999, when I had the honour of being Parliament’s first rapporteur on the Bank’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be said that we have succeeded in establishing permanent links between our two institutions and in ensuring a symbiotic relationship between, on the one hand, the wishes of the MEPs, who often pass on requests from associations and NGOs, and, on the other, the policies of the EIB, which, on the basis of our recommendations, has increasingly come into line with the Gothenberg-Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, as well as noting that the objectives have in the main been met by the EIB, I should simply like to draw attention to the difficulties that we cause the Bank via our demands. Mention has just been made of the Baltic oil pipeline. It is true that as soon as we demand the highest security when it comes to sustainable development, decisions need to be made on our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another, more complex, problem. We ask the Bank to lend more to SMEs; in other words, we ask it to find operational provisions enabling small businesses and relay banks to implement the objectives that we set for the Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have to bear in mind that the Bank’s primary task is to provide capital for projects in the Member States of the European Union. The Union supports loans to third countries, which may be regarded as part of the EU’s external policy. For that purpose, the EU gives the EIB a general mandate regarding guarantees for loans granted to external countries. Thanks to the EU’s guarantee, the aided countries receive loans at interest rates lower than those on the market. As for the view expressed in the report that the loans granted to countries in Latin America represent a small proportion of the total, I would point out that the EIB’s primary task is to finance projects within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">When it approved the new mandate on guarantees for external loans in December, Parliament at the same time said it wanted to participate in the setting of priorities for loans. Parliament unanimously called for the legal basis of the mandate to be changed so that it would better reflect the nature of development aid and simultaneously give Parliament a voice in the setting of priorities. The Council was not prepared, however, to change the legal basis. It is the opinion of the Committee on Budgets that Parliament should therefore bring an action against the Council in the Court of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee’s report focuses attention on support for SMEs. They are effectively supported by the European Investment Fund, whose rise in share capital is at present being debated by Parliament. Parliament is likely to support the proposal, with the EIF’s share capital being increased in line with a suggestion by the Commission. That means that SMEs will get extra cash, which is one response to the demands made in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, I cannot share this enthusiasm. That sounds a bit ungrateful; after all, the UK, which is far from being one of the poorest nations, seems to do pretty well out of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, we received EUR 3.979 billion in loans, which is 9.4 % of the total loans made to projects in the Member States. But the truth is that Britain is being loaned a lot less than it pays into the EU. In 2005, even after deducting the rebate we paid GBP 3.6 billion into EU coffers; that is about EUR 5.4 billion. That is not exactly value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no problem with some of the projects being funded, such as the East London railway upgrade scheme, or improved water supplies here and there. But, of course, the wind farm off the Cumbrian coast is a waste of money.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is, if Britain were not in the EU, it would be able to finance these schemes without any loans and with money to spare. So we would be a lot better off and we would not have to fly that wretched flag with its ring of stars. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

În aceiaşi termeni consider şi raportul privind activitatea desfăşurată în anul 2005 de către Banca Europeană de Investiţii pe care, îl apreciez ca fiind unul care îţi lasă, după lecturare, o stare de bine. Remarcabil este faptul că autorii s-au străduit şi au izbutit să prezinte de o manieră clară, atât activitatea desfăşurată în perioada de referinţă, cât şi programele de perspectivă menite să răspundă marilor provocări actuale cu care se confruntă Uniunea Europeană şi nu numai. Din lipsă de timp o să mă limitez doar la câteva remarci în legătură cu unul dintre aceste programe, şi anume cel referitor la promovarea coeziunii economice şi sociale în interiorul Uniunii Europene, în special în zonele puţin dezvoltate.</p>
<p class="contents">Un program generos, însă, fiindcă există un însă, având în vedere că raportul face referiri şi la zonele mai puţin dezvoltate ale spaţiului european, din care face parte şi România, m-aş fi aşteptat ca programul să conţină de o manieră mai concretă şi un eventual sistem de facilităţi precum termene de graţie, dobânzi încurajatoare şi altele, care să permită ţărilor din aceste zone recuperarea mai rapidă a decalajelor în vederea accelerării procesului de integrare în Uniunea Europeană.</p>

This debate comes at a good time for the EIB. In recent weeks, the subject that will presumably be the chief preoccupation of the next generation, or generations, has taken its place at the very top of the political agenda at long last: climate change. In this connection, I should like to suggest that the EIB review all its activities to identify the projects still receiving its support that we already know will rebound on us in the end on account of climate change. In what areas can the EIB be significantly more active? Here I am of course referring to the energy action plan in paragraph 6 of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">A much more fundamental approach can be taken to this. The EIB has a unique opportunity to make it quite clear that there are far-sighted European projects, too. Renewable energy is an infinitely large field, as is transport. The institution should advertise the fact that it saw the light in time on this, so that we can say in 10-15 years’ time that, back then, the EIB was indeed forward-looking in the loans it supported.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to paragraphs 19 and 21 of the report. I would ask the EIB to ensure that the funds do reach the final beneficiaries rather than seeping away or becoming stuck in intermediary banks. I ask it to concern itself with the environmental framework. Incidentally, it is my opinion that we are in urgent need of less EU red tape and more democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all must confront one basic challenge, namely, the modernisation of the internal market of an expanded Europe. I would say that the internal market of Europe can be characterised by the popular economic term 'transition economy'. Such economies are typified by uncertainty, risk, new challenges and a rapidly changing situation. I consider, therefore, that the European Investment Bank needs to be bolder in offering new financial instruments, and I would like to emphasise that the European Investment Bank operates in this direction in the fields of both borrowing and investing, especially in non-euro countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of importance to 'transition economies', which I know from my own experience, is that it is necessary to teach market participants how to use these instruments. A good many projects – very good projects – go unfunded from lack of knowledge. I would like to mention the well known <span class="italic">Jeremy</span> project for small enterprises, and the <span class="italic">Jasper</span> and <span class="italic">Jessica</span> projects. These will not be effective unless the Bank, which has acquired a large amount of information, shares this information and pays significant attention to technical support. Perhaps the Bank's remoteness, requiring it to operate through representatives in the regions, does not permit the Bank's input to be felt at the level of the ordinary citizen, the small enterprise or the small city. I hope that the Bank will value the opportunity of making its solutions more accessible to individual citizens and regions.</p>

For some time now, the bank has endeavoured to implement projects in line with the Lisbon Strategy, and I believe the positive effects of these projects will be felt in the near future. Nonetheless, I should like to make a few comments concerning the EIBs activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I must point out that the fundamental aim of the EIB is to support social and economic cohesion throughout the Member States of the European Union. Accordingly, a significant proportion of the bank’s funds should be devoted to the poorest regions of the European Union. Nonetheless, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, in the course of the last four years, and including 2005, the inverse was the case. The so-called Objective II regions received most of the support, to the detriment of the less economically developed Objective I regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a marked tendency on the part of the EIB to support the southern regions of the European Union, at the expense of its eastern ones. The same is true in the case of countries that are not members of the Union. The bank can be rightly proud of the many projects undertaken within the framework of the so-called Mediterranean neighbourhood policy, but I was unable to find a single project undertaken within the framework of the eastern neighbourhood policy on the bank’s web site.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment concerns the assessment of the effectiveness of projects undertaken by the bank. It seems clear to me that the bank should undertake <span class="italic">ex post</span> assessment of the results it achieves, measured in terms of economic growth and job creation. In particular, I agree with the rapporteur that making information and analysis on unsuccessful projects available could be helpful. It could identify indicators that would be useful to the bank when making decisions on the implementation of further projects in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the Bank can help us to retrieve some credibility at European level, but we must stop beating about the bush when it comes to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to propose to you that four specific initiatives be put to the March Summit: firstly, a significant European fund for renewing the European home – 50% of European gas is used to heat poorly insulated houses; a fund for modernising public lighting in Europe, leading to the replacement in just three years of six to eight polluting coal-fired power plants; a fund to aid European cities, leading to investment in public transport, because if we do not change our policy on big cities, it will not be possible to change European transport policy; and fourthly, the Bank's involvement in projects aimed at turning the North Sea, which is currently devoted to gas and oil, into a sea dedicated to offshore activities and then, in turn, to sea power.</p>

As Mr Maystadt rightly said, in November last year, this is a major issue to which the international financial community should respond. Competitive lending is an undesirable phenomenon, since its eventual effect is to reduce all conditions on loans to a minimum, at least provided that there are any conditions left in the areas of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the EIB think it might join with the international financial community in bringing pressure to bear on China? Considerations of human rights and democracy should not be made secondary to short-term economic gain, not even in Chinese credit policy in respect of Africa. While this House, in a resolution on relations with China, is making a powerful plea in favour of freedom and human rights, we would lose our credibility if we were not to prescribe these requirements as conditions for loans in the African countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this regard, the Innovation 2010 Initiative responds to the Lisbon Strategy’s commitment to making Europe a knowledge-based economy by means of operations in various areas, in particular the training of human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, loans were granted for education and training in the sum of EUR 2.3 billion.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Philippe Maystadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Investment Bank</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should first like to thank your rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero for his extremely thorough analysis of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB). Mr Montoro Romero put in a great deal of personal effort: he came to the Bank, asked a great many questions and, with the help of his colleagues, has produced a report that gets to the very kernel of the EIB's strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">These strategic objectives are encapsulated perfectly in the motion for a resolution, and I can inform you that the Bank unreservedly accepts the recommendations contained therein. As regards the priorities covered in paragraphs 2 to 10 of the motion for a resolution, we shall be pursuing our activities according to the proposed guidelines, including in the field of energy. The latter was rightly addressed by a number of speakers, and I can tell you that in the Business Plan for the next three years, we have decided to lend at least EUR 4 billion per year for energy-related projects, including at least EUR 800 million for renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have set ourselves one rule, which will, admittedly, not be easy to observe, but this is the rule we have set ourselves: we want at least half of the new production capacity for electricity that we shall be called on to fund to be linked to renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">A further axis of our activities in the area of energy will of course be that of improving energy efficiency. I have taken note of Mr Turmes’ specific proposals. I can tell him that, in several Member States, we are already funding social housing renovation programmes so as to improve energy efficiency, and are naturally ready to broaden our activities in this area, which, as you said, is crucial to our future.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the recommendations in the first part of the motion for a resolution, mention is made of the EIB’s representation in the Nordic countries, an issue also raised by Mr Krats. I can confirm to him that the EIB has in principle taken a decision to open a representative office in the Nordic countries. The interested Member States are working together and once an agreement has been reached between them, we shall be opening the office.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst on the subject of the EIB’s external offices, I noted Mr Olajos’ question about the EIB’s new offices in regions particularly affected by the Jaspers programme. We have decided to open three new offices. The first, in Warsaw, is already open, and the two others, in Bucharest and Vienna, will be open in the next two months. Mr Olajos wondered why Vienna had been chosen; he mentioned other possibilities, such as Budapest, Prague and Bratislava. Vienna was chosen because the Member States concerned were not able to reach agreement, and so Vienna appeared as the compromise choice.</p>
<p class="contents">To return now, more systematically, to the different forms of cooperation with the Commission mentioned by Mr Almunia, I wish to say to you that there are three important new initiatives: the Jeremie Programme, which is a very original programme for transforming the structural funds into renewable financial instruments; the Jaspers Programme to which I have already alluded, which is a form of technical assistance to help identify and prepare major projects that can be financed by the structural funds; and lastly, the Jessica Programme in the area of urban renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, still with the Commission, we have finalised a new guarantee fund for funding trans-European networks and a research facility, as mentioned by Mr Katzimarkakis, which forms part of the new financial instruments that Mrs Starkevičiūtė was seeking. This is just one example of innovations in the area, and should enable us, I repeat, to act, in conjunction with the Commission, as a lever to help markedly increase funding for research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers mentioned the role that the European Investment Fund could play. The Fund will expand still further with support for SMEs thanks to increased capital currently in preparation and thanks to an extra envelope of EUR 1 billion, via the ‘competitiveness and innovation' framework programme, leading to more innovative financial products benefiting new-start small businesses in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the remarks I wanted to make, Mr President. I can in any event confirm to you that, having read the motion for a resolution very carefully, we are prepared to implement its recommendations. Furthermore, if Parliament so wishes, we would be ready to draw up a report in one year’s time on the state of play regarding the implementation of these recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I support his proposals aimed at expanding the role of our public bank in order to facilitate the functioning of the internal market and to enhance the Union’s external role. I am disappointed, however, by the scant mention of financial aspects, in particular the reasons why the Member States have not released their contribution to the capital, amounting to EUR 155 billion. This situation leads to an obvious lack of capital and in turn to a lack of scope for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bank owes its outstanding marks solely to the fact that its stakeholders are the 27 EU Member States and that it enjoys Community budget guarantees on a great many of its financial commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I cannot explain why this Community guarantee is not always paid back transparently, transparency being an objective of the Bank praised in the report. It will be interesting to examine the Bank's voluntary implementation of the solvency ratio (Bâle II), the method used to implement it, and the aggregates making up this ratio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
