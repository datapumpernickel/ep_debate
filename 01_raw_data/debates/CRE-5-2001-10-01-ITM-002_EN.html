<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, and as you can imagine, it is my sad duty to have to open this session of Parliament with the news of several disasters that have claimed the lives of many people. When I have finished reading the statement, I would like to suggest that we observe a minute’s silence to pay tribute to the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a disaster on an unprecedented scale, in which 29 people died and 2500 were injured. We have all been concerned and deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims’ families, of the injured and by the grief of the people of Toulouse. Following the explosion at the AZF factory, I sent a message on behalf of Parliament, and on my own behalf, to the Mayor of Toulouse, Mr Douste-Blazy and to his fellow citizens, to express our solidarity and deepest sympathy. The exact causes of this awful disaster are still unknown, but one thing is certain: France, and all the countries of the European Union, must make a firm commitment to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again. It will be held up as an example of what we must no longer tolerate, wherever similar risks exist. People’s safety must never be compromised due to negligence, passivity or an overriding concern to save money.</p>
<p class="contents">In a repeat of previous incidents, this time in Northern Ireland, a journalist, Martin O’Hagan, was murdered on European Union soil by terrorists with a single objective – to spread fear by firstly attacking those who work to inform others. This appalling act is an attack by its perpetrators on the fundamental values of the European Union, namely the right to life, the rule of law and the freedom of expression. Under no circumstances must these acts of terrorism call into question the efforts of all those who, in spite of the difficulties they encounter, are working tirelessly to finally achieve the goals of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">On 27 September, a mentally disturbed man carried out a horrific attack on the Parliament of the Swiss canton of Zug, tragically killing 14 members of the local Parliament and government and also injuring approximately 10 people. As soon as I heard of these senseless murders, I sent, on behalf of everyone, our most sincere condolences to the authorities and a message of solidarity to the relatives of those killed and wounded.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this afternoon, we heard the news that a suicide attack was carried out against the Parliament of Kashmir in India, a despicable act in which 22 people have been killed so far and approximately 30 have been injured. The explosion also caused very considerable damage to the area around the Parliament building. We are all distressed and saddened by this attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to propose that we pay tribute to the victims of all these attacks by now observing a minute’s silence.</p>

On the morning of Friday 21 September, I was at home, less than two kilometres from the site of the explosion, and I can tell you that I now know what a tragedy really is. We have, all of us here, seen the images of this explosion on the television. I believe, and I can even be sure, that all my fellow Members from my region, such as Mrs Ainardi, Mrs de Veyrac, Mr Rod, join me in thanking all the Members who have expressed their sympathy and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to show you a damaged and charred metal girder, which I found at the factory site, over a kilometre from where the explosion occurred. Now you can imagine the state of the bodies that were found to the south of Toulouse.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, having observed a minute’s silence at the beginning of today’s debate, we must now try to restore the confidence of people everywhere who fear these bombs, and, as you have said, Madam President, we must ensure, with the votes we cast this week and by taking bold resolutions, that the disaster that occurred in Toulouse really is the last in a series of already too many incidents of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to say this because I wish to express my solidarity and that of my group with the statements by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, and in this case I regret that we have not heard him speak – since he always does so authoritatively, bravely and appropriately – in relation to the unfortunate public remarks of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, Mr Berlusconi, on the supposed superiority of Western civilisation over other civilisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is especially important now for the European Parliament to state strongly once again, that this is not a clash of civilisations, but, rather, that we have to defend values that are shared by all humanity. I therefore believe it is important that we, in the European Parliament, clearly express and demonstrate an approach, which is not just the approach of my group, and in this case I would like to address Mr Poettering to say that I was the first to applaud when, at the special sitting we held on the attacks of 11 September, he expressly cited the speech of Anwar al-Sadat in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that remarks such as those by Mr Berlusconi must be criticised by all of us and I hope, because it is not the first time, that they will not be repeated, since they damage the European cause throughout the world.</p>

<p class="contents">On the other hand, we recall Mr Solana’s words, spoken in the same spirit, who had advised – and I quote – that we must not create a rift, as this would be a huge mistake. Mr Berlusconi’s astounding and deeply shameful words show how important it is to issue a very clear response. First of all, we must strongly condemn the age-old rumour of the purported superiority of Western civilisation and Christianity. Then, we must decide upon an initiative, along the lines of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice, enabling the Council to determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the fundamental principles of the European Union and to address recommendations to that State.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore suggest, Madam President, that the Conference of Presidents examines what significant political action we would be advised to take in this matter.</p>

<p class="contents">I refer back to Anwar el Sadat's tremendous speech to the European Parliament on 10 February 1981 – we were meeting in Luxembourg in those days – in which he said: "Islam is a religion of love and not of hatred". On behalf of our group, I wish again to observe that we oppose the rhetoric which speaks of a clash of civilisations and that we desire partnership and friendship with all peace-loving Arab and Islamic countries. It is precisely for that reason, indeed, that I proposed that we should convene the Mediterranean Forum. I am given to understand, Madam President, that you too have it in mind to submit a proposal to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been addressed personally, I wish to point out certain misunderstandings which originate with a Member of the Commission. We agreed in the Conference of Presidents – Mr Barón Crespo was unable to be there last Thursday – that we do not want to make this the subject of the debate here in the plenary sitting but wish, rather, in the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, to consult with the Member of the Commission about the remarks that have been made. On behalf of our group, let me say here and now that we reach out our hands to all peace-loving Muslims, wherever they live throughout the world, be it outside the European Union, in the Arab and Islamic states or in a country of the European Union; we want peace, partnership and friendship with all Muslims of good will!</p>

That is why I should like, albeit reluctantly, to refer to the statements made by Mr Ecevit, who is trying to cash in on the terrorist incidents by levying accusations of terrorism against the Republic of Cyprus at a time when he, himself, is illegally occupying Northern Cyprus, as you quite rightly said during your visit to Athens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was a fearless journalist who over many years tirelessly illuminated that twilight world where gangsters and political terrorism and political extremism intersect. He has paid the ultimate price for his bravery.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an unfortunate fact of our life in this world today that many hundreds of journalists die virtually every year in pursuit of their vocation of serving and informing the public. This does not happen so often in democratic societies and it is particularly worrying, therefore, that journalists in Northern Ireland are at risk in this way. The few words I have said about Martin O'Hagan are entirely inadequate to convey the shock and the horror that people of all political and religious persuasions in Ireland feel at this horrible deed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to link this with other matters we have debated at previous part-sessions – indeed I am sure we will be debating them again this week – and make an appeal about the language we use to describe these terrorists. We should stop referring to them as Protestants, Catholics or Muslims: they are political extremists. It is important that we make that distinction.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The individuals concerned adhere to one or other religion, or have no religion, but their objectives are political, and the one common thing that unites them is their contempt for democracy and humanity.</p>

The Italian Prime Minister's statement has been criticised by many, including – which may be surprising – by Mr Haider, who found it too xenophobic.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you have always strongly advocated dialogue with Islam, and have also taken definite steps in the direction of such dialogue. Your policy stands in contradiction to what Mr Berlusconi has said. In view of the fact that you have had very forthright things to say in other situations – which I did not always find easy to defend back home, but I defended you because I have always valued your clear language – I think it important that you should find equally clear and unambiguous words in this connection. It is this that I ask of you.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps these words have passed me by; perhaps I have not heard them or not read them. I would ask you to make this Parliament's position in respect of these remarks quite clear. This is a Parliament that has always promoted dialogue and has always engaged in it. Our whole existence as a Parliament is bound up with the dialogue between religions and between cultures, and I believe that you, as President of this Parliament, should say so clearly and unambiguously on this occasion.</p>

Had you closely followed your President’s movements and official visits, you would be aware of my views. I shall send you some press cuttings, which are extremely enlightening and will, I believe, bring you up-to-date. I even believe that I may have been one of the first people – since you are giving me the opportunity to bring this up – to draw attention to the risk of an equation of Islam with terrorism. This was a natural thing to do as President and I knew that I was repeating the views of the House by stating this, and I certainly made this very clear in my first statement. Perhaps you also recall that I said this at the opening of the exceptional sitting that was held on the Wednesday, the day after the events. I will, however, send you all the details. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue has already been thoroughly addressed in Italy and it is certainly not evidence of a problem at European level but merely of a misunderstanding or, worse, the subversive interpretation of a phrase which could have been interpreted differently.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, has provided ample explanation of what he meant by the statement, which he intended to be extremely positive. The difference between the two civilisations is clear, and his intention was merely to highlight and emphasise that there is a great difference as regards genuine freedom, which exists in the West but not in the East, as regards equal opportunities for men and women, which are established in the West but denied in the East, and as regards all those differences in civilisation which – it cannot be denied – are there. That was what Mr Berlusconi meant by his statement, but, of course, everyone has read and interpreted it in their own way.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would go so far as to say that it would be dangerous for this House to focus on a statement such as this now: at such a sensitive time as this, we need clarity, transparency and positive thinking – not a vitriolic debate – and, most importantly, we have to have the ability, which I do not see in the opposition, to extend a hand and interpret what people say in the positive sense intended rather than always placing a negative interpretation on things.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore our intention to oppose any initiative seeking to open an interim procedure in this House, as has been suggested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
