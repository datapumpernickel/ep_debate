<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, a parallel process of regional integration has almost always accompanied the multilateral liberalisation of trade in the post-war period. In particular, the 1990's witnessed an exponential increase in the number of regional trade agreements being negotiated. Regionalism refers to the reaction by governments to liberalise or facilitate trade on a regional basis, sometimes through free trade areas or customs unions. In a double WTO context, regional trade agreements have both a broader meaning and a more specific one.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 24 of GATT allows for the exceptional establishment of preferential regional trade initiatives, granted that they meet the following criteria: firstly, double WTO members should be notified of the details; secondly, duties and other trade barriers should be reduced or removed substantially on all sectors of trade in the group; and thirdly, barriers of trade to non-signatories should not be higher than they were previously.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional trade agreements are not uniform. The coverage and depth of preferential treatment varies from one agreement to the other. One may involve only a few products or sectors, while the other may extend well beyond traditional tariffs to areas such as intellectual property and standards. In fact, a number of RTAs currently being negotiated seem to be anticipating an evolution of the multi-lateral trading system by seeking to cover subjects that have thus far been excluded from or not sufficiently discussed at a multilateral level, such as government procurement, child labour and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years RTAs have developed into a more complex configuration and there is a growing number of overlapping RTA networks that span across continents at regional and sub-regional level. Being a part of an RTA has its positive political benefits. On a most important level, RTAs have great strategic value and play a role in maintaining geopolitical balance in regions. RTAs are useful signals of a major power interest in the region, and maintaining strong economic and trade ties with all major powers may yet prove to be an effective means of maintaining regional stability.</p>
<p class="contents">FTAs should be based on the rule of reciprocity. Having said that, one should bear in mind that trade facilitation and globalisation is highly influenced by the relative development of participating countries. Differences in negotiating skills, technology, financing and quality of infrastructure are just a few of the impediments to the successful conclusion of an agreement involving at least one developing country. Yet the developing world cannot be left out of multilateral trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional integration is the backbone of the European Union. The trade aspect has been an essential component of what has ultimately evolved into a comprehensive political union. It has further served to maintain the EU's external relations with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency Conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council of June 1997 outline the basis of the EU's policy on FTAs. This was supplemented by the report to the European Council on the development of trade policy and the preferential agreements of the Community, which sets out the EU's objective of reflecting the nature of the relations with the partners concerned and a broader geopolitical environment. In the same document, the Commission goes on to state that the trade policy – particularly the FTA aspect – allows for the simultaneous development of a relevant regulatory framework in a more comprehensive manner than that currently allowed by the relevant multilateral framework and timeframe of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is slowly moving away from the establishment of traditional FTAs with its main trading partners. It is seeking deep integration and looks for convergence on regulatory regimes. The European Parliament and the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy support this approach by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission puts the multilateral approach first, which is also supported by the committee. However, despite strong economic relations, the EU does not have a single FTA in Asia. An FTA with an Asian country will anchor the presence of the EU in that region. Regional leaders in ASEAN have indicated that agreements such as that proposed by Singapore to the EU would not endanger regional relations. Rather, as long as the agreement offers scope for extension within the ASEAN region, it could boost momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">From a strategical viewpoint, the commercial presence of the EU would also counterbalance the influence and dominance of China and the United States. I hope that in the vote tomorrow my colleagues will support an agreement with Singapore, which I hope we could sign in the near future. I know the Commission has some reservations on this. However, it has already signed an extensive political agreement with the ASEAN region. Therefore I am convinced that in the near future there will be a mutual understanding between at least the ITRE Committee, the Commission and hopefully Parliament in its vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>.<span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, this own-initiative report by Mrs Mann on regional free trade areas addresses two central aspects of the Union's trade policy. The first is the issue of trade policy being used as a strategic tool within external relations, particularly where development policy is concerned. The second concerns the relationship between the multilateral approach and the bilateral approach. Before addressing these specific points, I should like to thank Mrs Mann for her excellent report and for the spirit of cooperation in which she has worked, which has made it possible for us to exchange ideas and information over a considerable period of time now, something which I believe has enabled us both, Parliament and the Commission, to move forward in our thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Mann has just said, our approach continues to be based on the Amsterdam Conclusions of June 1997. The Union's trade policy works on two complementary levels: the multilateral level first, that of the World Trade Organisation, and the bilateral level next, which is now increasingly regional. These two levels are justified, firstly by the fact that unilateralism is not an option for the European Union, and this is something that we have known for a long time. Secondly, since our priority is multilateralism, regionalism – or our bilateral agreements – complement this multilateral choice, the second level being as it were subordinate to the first. Seen in this light, regionalism is not a kind of ersatz multilateralism, but complements a fundamental choice, which is that of the World Trade Organisation. We actually believe that the globalised markets need common rules and global institutions to regulate them. The Union's faith in the multilateral approach, which it had ten years ago, is even stronger today. We want to manage globalisation; we want to reduce the destabilising effect of a number of factors. That is why an approach based on a multilateral trading system is our priority, as moreover is reflected by the agenda that was adopted in Doha. On this basis, I think that there is a very broad consensus between the position expressed by Mrs Mann and that of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being then it is the multilateral approach that is our number one priority, and that is why we have postponed any decision to launch new negotiations on free trade areas until the round that we began in Doha is completed. In addition to this time constraint, we think that any new initiative in this field should be duly justified and meet a number of conditions. Firstly, it must be compatible with the WTO, and Mrs Mann reminded us of the rules in this respect. Secondly, a bilateral agreement should provide added value compared with the WTO, and when I say that I am thinking of the value of the WTO at the end of the Doha round. Thirdly, and finally, a new initiative should not distract us from our multilateral priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Does this mean that we are neglecting free trade areas? No. The Union has been a major user of these regional negotiations. Moreover, we are working very actively on a number of them, with Mercosur and with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and we recently concluded agreements with Chile and Egypt, amongst others. These agreements, both the ones that we have concluded most recently and those that we are in the process of negotiating, have some characteristics that are rather new compared with the traditional concept of a free trade area. We have as it were moved on a generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moves to liberalise trade in goods and services now increasingly go hand in hand with the adoption of new bilateral rules that go beyond multilateral rules. A second characteristic of this new generation of agreements is that the Union is increasingly seeking to develop region-to-region relations. Examples are Mercosur and the Gulf Cooperation Council, but also the Andean Community, Central America and South-East Asia – I will come back to this in a moment – or even the regional negotiations that will shortly be getting underway in Africa. We actually think today that it is this regional approach, bringing together several of our partners, that may bring greater economic benefits, since as it were the regional integration of our partners increases the market potential and makes the regulatory work more cost-effective. This is what Mrs Mann a moment ago called deep integration and it is initiatives of this kind that we are in the process of launching, including with South-East Asia in the form of the very recent cross-regional EU-ASEAN initiative launched just over a month ago in Laos, in Luang Prabang. Our intention is to start an action programme focusing on the main regulatory priorities of the two sides. This is also the approach that we have adopted in our relations with Canada and it underpins our work with the Andean Community and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise the Commission's position on this point, I will say that the fact that President Prodi has not launched any new initiatives for free trade areas is not a sign of passivity but a deliberate choice. This is clearly explained by the priority that we have accorded to Doha, but also by our conviction that free trade areas in the traditional sense of the word are not really the right instrument for opening up trade in the twenty-first century and that we now need to modify this format. This, by the way, is also what guides us in our relations with developing countries, something to which Mrs Mann devotes considerable space in her report. We think, like her, that although there are advantages to opening up trade, these advantages only become a reality if several conditions are met. Firstly, market access is necessary for developing countries, but it is clearly not enough on its own to bring direct benefits in terms of growth and employment. A decisive ingredient needs to be added, which is aid to strengthen trade capacities. That is what we are providing at multilateral level. We are also providing it in the preparations for the negotiation of regional economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we entirely in agreement then? Not quite. And since we do need to identify a few areas where we differ, I have looked very hard and will mention two before concluding. The first concerns the idea mentioned by Mrs Mann of opening negotiations with Singapore with a view to creating a free trade area. We are not convinced at this stage that such an initiative would indeed boost momentum in the region. For the reasons that I have just given, Mrs Mann, our preference is therefore still for a joint approach with the ASEAN countries. We are also hesitant about the idea that you put forward in your report that the Union should undertake to fill the gap in the budgets of developing countries caused by the reduction in customs duties. For the time being there is no proof of customs duties being lost, especially if the volume of trade were to increase as we hope it will, both in a South-South direction and in a North-South one. We are not ruling out this idea, but in the light of the data that is currently available it does seem premature.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the two minor reservations that I should like to voice on behalf of the Commission. Nevertheless, it is clear that our reaction to your report is dominated to a very large extent by areas where our views converge. I would add that it is a great advantage for the Commission to have its strategy and positions supported by the European Parliament in international negotiations. For all of these reasons, I see this report as confirming the high quality of our working relations and would like to thank Mrs Mann once again for her excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all aware of the fact that trade relations are a factor in economic growth, but it is equally true that not all countries have been able to integrate into the world trade system and take advantage of the opportunities it offers to improve their development, which has increased inequality between rich and poor countries. There is therefore a clear need to manage globalisation by means of multilateral standards drawn up from a policy perspective in order to make trade relations at world level a beneficial force for all, which contributes to the objective of eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important for the European Union to define a trade strategy that places the specific needs of less developed countries at the heart of trade negotiations, in order to make possible the gradual incorporation of these countries into the multilateral trade system. In fact, the right of access – including non-reciprocal access – of poorer countries to the markets of developed countries is vastly insufficient for guaranteeing genuine development of trade flow if – as you yourself pointed out, Commissioner – we do not simultaneously strengthen their capacity for industrial and agricultural development, respect for the rules in force in the importing countries and familiarity with trade circuits, as well as their administrative capacities and their financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For precisely this reason, the Committee on Development and Cooperation fully supports the incorporation of the development aspect into the Doha agenda and welcomes the impetus provided to this end by the European Union, and specifically yourself, Commissioner Lamy, in order to promote this development aspect. At the same time, however, it considers that it is vital to ensure coherence between multilateralism and regionalism, between the rules established by the World Trade Organisation on the liberalisation of regional trade and the development of areas of free trade, including the proliferation of agreements between countries and regions with very different levels of development, because it believes that only this way, with this coherence, will we be able to make trade relations a genuine factor in development for all peoples and finally eradicate poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me add a few observations. By means of this report, we are setting out the principles by which we trade and cooperate commercially with the world’s regions. Of course, it also gives direction and a specific character to the many possibilities open to us there, which we also have at regional level. Our group works on the fundamental assumption that we are thereby able to build up free and fair global trade, and that those countries that have not so far had sufficient opportunity to engage in trade, have the chance, through the establishment of their own free trade areas, to share in this development. I see this – not only in view of what Commissioner Lamy said – as an important guide to the timeframe within which, in the aftermath of Doha, a renaissance of regional trade agreements around the world may perhaps come about. I get the impression the cooperation with certain countries – such as Singapore – can also be the key to regional free trade agreements with regions that are themselves not yet in a position, or not sufficiently advanced, to take partnership further. That is why we should be using the idea of cooperation with Singapore as the prelude to greater cooperation with ASEAN. The specific characteristics of the region present us with a broad spectrum of diverse possibilities, which must of course remain subject to the World Trade Organisation. The development of, for example, the West African market also requires, not only that we open our own market, but that West Africa should be put in a position to do better business with Central Africa and Southern Africa, as Mrs Mann pointed out in her report on South-South trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very much in favour of the multilateral approach, but I also remain convinced that regionalism and multilateralism can strengthen and supplement each other in many respects. I agree with the rapporteur when she says that the European Union must also continue to support and promote regional cooperation and integration in the future, therefore. In addition, the idea of using the establishment of free trade areas as instruments of development seems to me to be a very interesting train of thought, provided that they form part of a general package of reform measures. I should like to point out, however, that, for the benefit of the developing countries, we have to beware of ending up in an inextricable tangle of regional and multilateral initiatives. In my view, today the multilateral approach still deserves to take priority over regional initiatives. In other words, the top priority of the European Union must at this moment be the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda. The discussion on regionalism and multilateralism, as important as it is, must be postponed until then. In any case, Mrs Mann’s report constitutes an interesting contribution to this, and for this I thank her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the motion for a resolution that is proposed to us in Mrs Mann's report includes, in paragraph 21, a call for European trade policy to be brought fully within the Community system as such, with exclusive competence for the Community, majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go along with this Community fundamentalism, which is based on the idea that only supranational mechanisms are appropriate for this policy, so as to foster greater openness at global level and to sideline the nation states. But opening up world markets, as useful as it may be, is not everything. We also have to recognise that the Member States have societal models and fundamental interests to protect. We therefore need to leave them the means to do so and strike a fair balance between European policy and national interests, between supervision by the European Parliament and supervision by the national parliaments. In our opinion, Mrs Mann's report does not strike this balance.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, there is a need to recognise that taking decisions by a qualified majority in the Council may not always have the desired effect. Let us take a topical example: the Convention on the Future of Europe is reflecting on the possibility of making our entire trade policy subject to the majority rule, thus doing away with the derogations recognised by the Treaty of Nice for certain essential services, in particular cultural services, that this Treaty states continue to require unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Government has protested and requested that unanimity be maintained because it provides greater protection. We approve. But as an aside, why accept this here and not elsewhere? At the same time, an association of large, mainly American, companies, the International Communications Round Table, is obligingly writing to the Convention and to the Commission to sing the praises of the majority rule. This illustrates the fact that in practice this rule would make it possible to ignore opposition from individual nations in specific areas and thus bring down our defences.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are asking the Convention to look at the bigger picture and to take a more balanced view. First, we need to increase the involvement of national parliaments. Secondly, the majority procedure should only be used for adopting safeguard measures. On the contrary, whenever it is a question of reducing our protection, decisions should be taken by unanimity so as not to damage anyone's interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should just like to say a few words in reply to Mr Berthu on the subject of whether trade policy should be decided by unanimity or a qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr Berthu – and this will probably be increasingly true in the future – we live in a world of elephants and in this world power struggles, particularly over trade matters, are largely determined by the weight of the participants.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union wishes to bring its full weight to bear then unanimity is not the way to do so. Experience has shown this. The situation is very simple: in this field either we want to carry weight in the world in which we live and will continue to live, and in that case in a Europe of 25 we need qualified majority voting, or we do not want to – and I certainly understand that this might well be Mr Berthu's point of view; it would not surprise me in the least – in which case we should indeed maintain unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that unanimity is the best guarantee of sovereignty is something that Mr Berthu has just reiterated. I am not surprised by this and I wanted to draw your attention to it. It is true today where cultural matters are concerned, as it is in other areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
