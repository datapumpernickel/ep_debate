<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Langen </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1998 the European Commission submitted a report on the structures and rates of excise duty as well as a proposal for the amendment of three different directives on the taxation of manufactured tobacco. The report, which provides the basis for the proposed technical amendments and for the changes in the minimum rates of excise duty, examines whether current legislation guarantees the smooth functioning of the single market. Two factors are particularly important in this context: firstly the fact that tax fraud and smuggling are rife as a result of the relatively high rates of excise duty on tobacco and tobacco products and because of the wide disparities between the excise rates levied by the various Member States, and secondly the fact that the practical application of the rules governing excise duty has raised a number of problems which call for technical adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">The current system was introduced in 1993, and today's proposal has its origins in lengthy discussions in connection with the single market which date back to 1995. Excise duties on tobacco are a significant source of revenue for the Member States, varying from 0.4 % of GNP to 1.6 % of GNP in Greece, for example. The fact that duty is generally suspended when goods subject to excise duty are taken from one Member State to another creates problems with documentation, with the potential for forgery and with other aspects of such operations, and indeed the European finance ministers will scarcely be able to rest easy when they check the findings announced last year by the President of the Court of Auditors, which put revenue shortfall from excise duties at the alarming figure of EUR 75 billion per annum, with particular problems in the areas of value‐added tax, excise duties on tobacco and duties on wines and spirits. This is an appallingly large revenue shortfall, which certainly calls for direct action on fraud and tax evasion in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, unfortunately, we are not dealing with the fight against tax fraud or even with the harmonisation of measures in that area, but rather with relatively modest adjustments. When we talk about tobacco duties, we have to distinguish between the excise duties on cigarettes and those on tobacco products other than cigarettes. These other products account for only about 5 % of the total market. Cigarettes account for the other 95 %, but as far as they are concerned, this report only deals with technical adjustments to the taxation regime. The system for calculating the minimum rates of excise duty is highly complex, and I do not propose to hold forth on that subject here, since only a handful of specialists understand it in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">The substance of the proposal made by the Commission is that rates of excise duty may fall short of the minimum levy, which is 57 % of the retail price, for an adjustment period of up to two years. The proposal also provides for a very moderate increase in two stages, the first of which was scheduled for 1 January 1999; as you will be aware, that date has passed without the change having been effected and without Parliament having delivered its opinion. The second stage of the moderate increase is due to take effect on 1 January 2001. These amendments were supported by a majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, with the tax increases only securing a narrow majority, and the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has now tabled new amendments which would upset the existing balance. If we were to accept these amendments, the minimum excise duty on loose tobacco for those who hand‐roll their own cigarettes would rise drastically, which would make sudden 30 % price increases inevitable. We were opposed to this, and I ask the House to reject these amendments proposed by the Liberal Group, since they relate to a specifically Dutch problem and have nothing to do with young people's smoking habits.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fallacy that those who have just taken up smoking are most likely to roll their own cigarettes. On the contrary, the main purchasers of loose tobacco come from a particular age group and a particular income bracket and are established smokers. Young people go for lighter cigarettes. But we have also asked the Commission to present an interim report by 30 June 2000 on the subject of public health and in particular on the problem of tax fraud, and I should like to underline that point. Another reason why the interim report is necessary is that nothing has been happening in this sector. I should like to express my thanks for our past consultations, and I hope that the great majority of the House will approve the report as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.</p>

We welcome his committee's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">But, my goodness, here we are talking about tobacco taxes when a large proportion of these taxes are not even collected in the European Union. The truth is that, like alcohol, tobacco has an irresistible attraction for organised crime. And anyone who was present at the Committee of Inquiry on Community transit, anyone who regularly reads UCLAF reports or anyone who keeps abreast of current affairs in my own country, where 70 containers of tobacco disappeared just the other day, with the Portuguese Government claiming 14 billion escudos in compensation from a transport company, will know just how many millions escape the Community"s financial checks. And this often happens with the connivance of the Member States and also of certain European institutions, as funding for scanners for border checks and for physical checks at ports is often not granted. Nevertheless, I think we should be talking about taxes. But it would also be advisable for the Commission to think about how it checks the payments due to it and how it could force defaulters to pay up.</p>
<p class="contents">Another omission I identified in the Commission document was the lack of a programme to educate young people about tobacco. They are the smokers of the future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Metten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, the European Commission is very modest when it comes to the approximation of taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products. It gives the Member States more flexibility in applying the minimum rate of 57 % of the retail price. As a result, this percentage can actually fall below 57 % for a time. Whilst this is presented as a technical measure, we shall have to make sure that it does not distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this flexibility, the Commission is proposing to adapt the specific duties on tobacco products to inflation in two stages. Given that actual duties are already higher everywhere than the minimum levels, this is primarily a cosmetic proposal. In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, however, it was the view of the largest possible minority that the European Commission should have done more. Mr Langen made reference to this just now. We think that there should be an end to the preferential treatment given to shag and hand‐rolling tobacco, which currently attracts a far lower rate of tax than cigarettes, with which it is in competition.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, amongst others, three amendments tabled by the Liberal Group, Nos 6, 7 and 8, which my group supported and will support again. If there is any reason to tax hand‐rolling tobacco or shag differently from cigarettes, then the tax should in fact be higher, because shag is generally more harmful than cigarettes. The lower tax on shag constitutes a price incentive which steers smokers towards the very product which is most harmful. That misguided incentive has to end. This does not in any way mean that the hand‐rolling tobacco industry has to come to an end, but simply that it has to lose its fiscally advantaged status. In this respect, Amendment No 7 by the Liberal Group is less radical, since it raises the percentage of the price to the consumer accounted for by tax from 30 to 45 %. You have to compare that with the 57 % for cigarettes.</p>
<p class="contents">The strangest of arguments are heard in the debate on equal tax treatment for cigarettes and shag. Not only should hand‐rolling tobacco continue to enjoy a tax advantage because that is good for jobs in the small business sector, but shag is supposedly the poor man"s cigarette, since the poor man cannot afford real cigarettes. But if you put a high rate of tax on tobacco products to dissuade people from consuming a product which harms their health, and all Member States do that, you cannot tax the most harmful tobacco products at a lower rate. If smoking is harmful to health, it is also harmful to the health of the poorest people.</p>
<p class="contents">My group"s view is that there is no place here for cynical derogations. Cynical is exactly the word to describe those who favour the present system. So the Commission proposal and the Langen report do not go far enough. I very much hope that the Commission will shortly come up with a more radical reform of the taxation of tobacco products. If my group has anything to do with it, Parliament will make a start on that tomorrow.</p>

Because of this, we need to give the protection of public health special attention, imposing taxes on tobacco products at national level and introducing legislation on tobacco at Union level. Revenue from tobacco products will in future have to be increasingly steered in the direction of preventive public health measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Tobacco is not just a national or regional problem, but very much a global one. For example, the activities of American tobacco companies in Asia, where there is still no ban on tobacco advertising or legislation to protect public health, are positively scandalous. For example, there have been threats to move big sports events to countries where the interests of tobacco companies are viewed more sympathetically.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive now being discussed mainly contains technical amendments to Community legislation on taxation of tobacco products. In addition to the technical amendments, we also need to solve surveillance problems connected with the transportation of cigarettes. Organised criminal gangs smuggle cargoes of cigarettes to avoid paying duty, yet some Member States are against the introduction of effective surveillance systems. In my opinion, sanctions should be imposed on Member States in future if they fail to adopt modern and effective surveillance systems without delay within the framework of the taxation system that has now been proposed.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Holm </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I can only agree with what Mrs Matikainen‐Kallström said in her excellent speech and with her views on tobacco, which I entirely share. Tobacco and smoking cause harm. We must do everything we can to make poor wretches like me who smoke stop, and to discourage young people from smoking in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Greens would like the tax on tobacco, or rather the price of tobacco, to be as high as possible. However, the internal market makes that rather difficult. In Sweden, for example, tobacco prices are among the highest in the EU; a packet of tobacco in Sweden costs an arm and a leg. However, our overall tax is among the lowest in Europe. Consequently, Sweden does not currently comply with the minimum tax rate in the directive of 57 %. It is therefore essential for the Commission to review the problem of taxation, so as to allow individual countries to impose higher taxes. Sweden, after raising the tax on tobacco two years ago, was then forced to lower it again because of a dramatic increase in smuggling and tax evasion, which compelled us to lower prices again. This should not happen, but we must have higher taxes on tobacco in order to force us to smoke less.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Porto </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I do not intend to comment on Werner Langen's report, although I do congratulate him on it. I just want to express my regret that the Commission has not taken this opportunity to switch to an <span class="italic">ad valorem</span> tax on tobacco instead of the present system, which is largely specific.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said here back in 1992, at the time the first regulations were adopted, this means that some types of tobacco bear a heavier burden than others, resulting in a distortion of competition. In this particular case, this distortion works in favour of American tobacco, which is more expensive, so that specific taxation amounts to a smaller fiscal burden, thus disadvantaging European tobaccos, which are generally cheaper and therefore more heavily taxed in percentage terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The heavier tax burden on these cheaper European tobaccos amounts to a regressive form of taxation, as they represent a larger proportion of goods bought by people on lower incomes. It could be argued that this is conducive to the socially desirable objective of reducing total tobacco consumption, given that there are more poor smokers than rich ones. However, given that we should be equally concerned about the health of the poor and of the rich, it would be hard to justify a policy that benefited the health of the poor at the expensive of the rich. I cannot imagine what political philosophy could be used to justify this distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot understand, and this is the point of my speech, why the Commission has not taken this opportunity to adopt a purely <span class="italic">ad valorem</span> form of taxation. It cannot say that it is a question of administrative convenience, given that there are precedents for this kind of taxation and given that it is extremely easy to levy taxes of this kind on a very limited number of well‐organised producers.</p>

And now moves are afoot, in the form of Amendments Nos 2, 5 and 6, to make marketing even more difficult by adding 30 % to prices, which would further increase the incentive to engage in smuggling and line the pockets of those responsible for transit fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that arbitrary censorship of tobacco advertising is a disaster in terms of health policy. What we need in tobacco advertising is rational, explanatory, quality‐orientated information. If a blanket ban is imposed on advertising, there will be no means of advising consumers on their best course of action. I believe it quite simply represents a lost opportunity to educate smokers in the use of better‐quality tobacco as a health protection measure. This arbitrary censorship scheme simply must be scrapped. We must be given the opportunity to advertise in a way that focuses on health, and in a way that can prevent young people from taking up smoking at an excessively early age. Perhaps the focus should be on sheer enjoyment and on moderation, to combat chain‐smoking, and if some people smoke the odd cigarette for enjoyment, they should not be immediately subjected to social sanctions. Tobacco is a legal product, a highly taxed product, and I believe it is inappropriate to ban the advertising of such a product.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cresson, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Langen for his report and for the conclusions that he has drawn. In general, Mr Langen recognises the need to make some technical adjustments to Community legislation on the taxation of tobacco products. These changes were seen to be essential during the last review of the rates and structures of excise duty on tobacco products, in order for the provisions to be interpreted and applied in a more uniform manner in the Member States, and also in order that they may be easier to implement, so that the single market can function correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Having consulted national governments, firms and interest groups, the Commission did not feel it was appropriate to carry out a fundamental review of the existing structure, and in particular of the minimum rates applied to tobacco products.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments proposed by Mr Langen concerning the extension of the period of review of the rates and structures, the Commission can accept a period of four years instead of the five years envisaged in its draft proposal. The report will take into account the proper functioning of the single market, the real value of the rates of duty and the wider objectives of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments proposed, in order to include the recitals on fraud, health and the links between these elements and the price of manufactured tobacco, allow me to say that I do not see the need for such an approach in the directives covered by Article 99 of the Treaty. The directives are limited to establishing a minimum level of taxation for the products in question, while leaving the governments of the Member States to fix the rates at national level, as long as the minimum levels established in Directives 92/79/EEC and 92/80/EEC are respected. Subject to this provision, it is therefore to a large extent up to the Member States to decide on the level of taxation that they apply and to take into consideration factors such as health and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">As the assessment carried out in order to draw up the report on manufactured tobacco products did not reveal any justification for progressively aligning taxes on hand‐rolling tobacco with the existing taxes on cigarettes, the amendments concerning an increase in rates for hand‐rolling tobacco are unacceptable to the Commission. The hand‐rolling tobacco industry is less automated than the cigarette industry and therefore needs a more concentrated work‐force. In order to safeguard their livelihood and also to safeguard employment, the lower rate for hand‐rolling tobacco was deemed necessary. Once again, there is nothing to prevent Member States from fixing high national rates for this product if they consider this to be necessary for health reasons.</p>

She then ended by saying that tax on tobacco and tobacco products was so important for health. I really cannot follow that at all. She made reference to research carried out by Member States and professional organisations. I should like to hear from her what the interest groups to which she refers – for example health bodies and consumer organisations – have to say on this subject.</p>

If what Mr Metten has said is correct, it would have to be an amendment that affects cigarettes, because 99 % of the market is unaffected by the proposals that the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has tabled. They only affect one per cent, which is precisely the share of the market that is still in the hands of small and medium‐sized businesses. The cigarette industry is highly concentrated. Can you confirm, Commissioner, that the plans to increase tobacco duty which Mr Metten is advocating here would only affect small and medium‐sized businesses, which account for one per cent of total turnover, and that Mr Metten's health‐based arguments are therefore unfounded?</p>
