<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lulling </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, in 1993, the entry into force of the single market and the removal of border controls resulted in the withdrawal from VAT returns of statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, the reliability of which was guaranteed by the customs services. As we still have a need for statistics on trade in goods within the Community, Intrastat was established, and firms were obliged to supply the necessary information to enable this body to establish the statistics. Firms, and particularly SMEs, were of course not enchanted with the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 1997, the Commission presented us with two proposals to simplify the 1991 regulation, with the aim of reducing the obligations for firms, and particularly SMEs, in terms of tax returns, and to reduce costs for those liable to pay tax. Even during the first reading, it was clear that in the Council the Member States were not even prepared to support these proposals, even though they had been toned down in relation to the results of the first study carried out within the framework of the SLIM initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, at first reading we tabled amendments to limit the tax return burden, to remove non‐relevant information, for example means of transport and optional information, in order to limit the number of SMEs obliged to provided detailed statistical information. Their aim was also to simplify the use of combined nomenclature, while preserving a single nomenclature for intra‐Community trade and trade with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We pointed out that this was only a first step in the right direction, while awaiting a more fundamental simplification, especially as the reliability of the Intrastat statistics is unfortunately inversely proportional to the costs that are borne by the 450 000 firms that have to supply the data.</p>
<p class="contents">With the exception of one detail, we had the Commission"s blessing on the amendments that were unanimously adopted at first reading. However, the Council then forwarded to us a common position that further weakened the original Commission proposal, which had already been weakened in relation to the results of the SLIM studies, and which we wished to strengthen by means of our amendments. Moreover, that common position would have resulted in an increase in the tax return burden for firms. The Council even went so far as to simply refuse to adopt a common position on the proposal for a regulation concerning nomenclature.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of such a negative attitude from the Council, we refused to give in. We retained our amendments at second reading, and we went to a Conciliation Committee. We reached the following compromise: as there is no common position on nomenclature, we were able to obtain a declaration from the Council promising to consider the position on nomenclature, taking account of Parliament"s amendments and of the results of the discussions currently taking place within the framework of a second SLIM initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">We achieved this result because, in the Conciliation Committee, I was able to confront the Council delegation with the decisions of the Ecofin Council of 18 January 1999, which state, ironically, that the current Intrastat system holds more details than is necessary, that it should be simplified, that costs should be limited and that the 1991 regulations should be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought I must be dreaming when I read that, as the Council had presented us in July last year with a ‘decaffeinated" common position on the proposal to modify the 1991 regulation. In December 1998 we maintained our amendments against the common position, and then in January 1999, the Council discovered that there was a need to modify Regulation (EEC) No 330/91. Meanwhile, the Commission proposal had been on the table since 2 June 1997 and there had been two readings in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it that in the Council, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing? Is this an illustration of the obvious political malfunctioning of the Council? How is it possible that in January 1999 the Council can demand a much greater simplification of the Intrastat regulation, which it had refused in July 1998, forcing us to go to a Conciliation Committee? Make of it what you will! In any case, I am pleased to have persevered at second reading, and I also welcome the Commission declaration promising to submit a report to us on the Intrastat system.</p>
<p class="contents">If I had to estimate the cost of the work that has been done since 1997, it would certainly be inversely proportional to the results, which are even more meagre when compared to the ambitions of the first SLIM study and to our ambitions for reducing the burden on firms. However, at least the Council"s contradictions have enabled us to make a new start, which we hope is more promising than what we have had to go through on this issue over the last few years.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paasilinna </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the delegation to the Conciliation Committee for a very successfully drafted report. It is a most pleasurable opportunity to say this on a day like today, the penultimate day of this parliamentary term. I believe that through conciliation we have achieved a compromise, which indicates that both the codecision procedure works well and that Parliament has demonstrated its strength.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive which went to conciliation is important for small companies, and, hence, the issue of employment. In the European Union there are approximately 18 million SMEs, and almost 17 million unemployed. This comparison of figures already suggests that we must do our utmost to ensure that the SME sector is able to remove the burden of bureaucracy and complexity from its shoulders. By reducing the amount of data that has to be provided on statistics on trade, we are making an important difference to those SMEs which do not have the resources to produce and maintain complicated sets of statistics. The compromise that was reached in conciliation will ease the burden for SMEs, which hopefully will then mean that those companies can put this part of their expenditure and endeavour to better use, thus boosting employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union and Member States the role of labour‐intensive SMEs in particular has been considered central to improved levels of employment. If we can continue to simplify matters for them in the areas of thresholds and obstacles, that will be a good thing. The euro is an important factor for small companies, as it removes the need to exchange foreign currencies in the single market area. Small companies do not generally have the means or skills to monitor currency situations to keep them completely up‐to‐date on how exchange rates are behaving. This being the case, the single currency will be of great benefit to SMEs, lowering, as it will, the degree of risk they encounter in the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">During the conciliation process Parliament also had the opportunity to send a political message to the Commission on another matter that was being dealt with. This too demonstrates the strength of the codecision procedure. Now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has been in force for just under a week and the role of the codecision procedure is growing in importance, perhaps we have reason to congratulate ourselves, Parliament, and the triumph of democracy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Lulling for her very committed efforts on behalf of SMEs and other businesses. She rightly recognised that firms need less red tape so that they have more time for their customers, and that this also provides an opportunity to create new jobs. I would also like to thank Mr Paasilinna, who has always given this initiative his strongest support and who has shown us the way in this field. I would also very much like to thank the Commission, because the research we were promised as part of the SLIM‐Intrastat initiative, looking particularly at the issues of quality and the burden on the economy, is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this research is very important for us in Europe. We are always talking about relieving the burden of bureaucracy and supporting firms in order to create new jobs. This is a real opportunity to find a new approach. I think it is very important that we have decided to cut down on the number of people required to provide information, as well as reducing the amount of information to be given, although we do, of course, want to have an acceptable level of information. What we want, in other words, is a good cost‐benefit ratio, so that the exercise is a profitable one. In Austria we are shortly to hive off the Central Statistical Office, making it into an independent profit‐making operation. People using the data will have to pay for doing so, because if the data are worth anything, then there should be a price to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also stress that we have made great efforts to use a single nomenclature for internal and external trade, and we are reducing the number of sections from eight to six, which I think is very important. We need to have data that are manageable. They will not be broken down so finely, but they should still provide a clear overview of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also welcome the fact that the transport sector and supply conditions have been dropped. What we want is to be able to obtain really efficient data rapidly. They should be collected in computerised form as far as possible, and we should encourage firms to supply them voluntarily, using systems of incentives rather than fines. We must see to it that the most up‐to‐date statistical methods are used, such as random sampling, market research and opinion surveys. I think that this will bring us much closer to the people, and we will then be more readily accepted by businesses, have greater room for manoeuvre on the world market and thereby create new jobs.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> In the framework of the SLIM initiative, the Commission presented two proposals for a regulation on 30 May 1997 with the aim of simplifying the basic legislation on the Intrastat system. Their objective is to relieve the burden on those who have to provide statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first proposal, the number of compulsory variables to be provided in declarations was reduced, and in the second, the nomenclature of products used to classify traded goods was simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first proposal on reducing the number of variables covered, the conciliation procedure allowed us to reach a satisfactory result on the Commission"s initial proposal. This result was obtained through the combined efforts of our two institutions – Parliament and the Commission – and we are very pleased about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint text agreed in this way represents an important step in the work to relieve the burden on businesses, and particularly SMEs. To be specific, from 1 January 2001, small and medium‐sized enterprises will no longer have to provide five variables. However, the Member States will retain their option to request the ‘delivery terms", ‘mode of transport" and ‘statistical procedure" variables for businesses that are above a certain threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal on simplifying the nomenclature, the Commission notes with satisfaction that all the institutions acknowledge the importance of simplifying the combined nomenclature. Its importance is highlighted in the joint text through a specific recital to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission would like to point out that the Council is willing to examine the proposal for a regulation on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Commission is satisfied with these specific simplifications, which businesses will soon benefit from, and would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on her excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is only the first step. The Commission is committed to continuing with the SLIM/Intrastat initiative and the EDICOM actions for businesses, in accordance with the Council"s position on the need for information in the framework of economic and monetary union.</p>

I know that Friday should be a complete working day for all Members, but unfortunately absenteeism among Members is legendary on Friday mornings. I would like to point out that, in the ten years that I have once again been a Member of this Parliament – I was previously a Member from 1965 to 1974 – I have been present at all the Friday sittings, and if I am re‐elected on 13 June, I will show the same level of discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Things being as they are, I nevertheless regret that Parliament is setting a dangerous precedent by voting on a Friday morning on a third reading, something which in my opinion should be done by qualified majority, so that we can reach the heights of the powers that Parliament has worked so hard to achieve. I know that a simple majority is stipulated, but that is completely illogical. If we vote by qualified majority at second reading, there is all the more reason to do so at third reading. In this respect there is also a great deal of work to be done on our Rules of Procedure, and I do not think that we are doing ourselves any favours by setting this precedent tomorrow. I hope that this will not be the case for much longer. I know that these are only statistics, but it does cost the 450 000 firms more than EUR 500 million to supply the data, and what is at stake is just as important as any other conciliation report.</p>
