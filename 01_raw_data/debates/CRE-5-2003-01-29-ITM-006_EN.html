The Commission has responded with a hundred comments and answers and explanations in a 60 page document. We now report in the follow-up, in our comment on the Commission's response. We underline once again that the Commission under the Treaties has an obligation to make available to Parliament all the necessary information. It is on this basis that Parliament can examine and investigate all the transactions so that the discharge is not only a procedure, but rather a substantial assurance to the European public that Parliament supervises on their behalf and that a rigorous and thorough investigation is carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">In its work, Parliament relies heavily on the Court of Auditors' annual report and its special report. This forms an important basis for the issues that we raise and investigate. I believe that, in recent years, the Commission has tried very hard to supply Parliament and the European public with all the information necessary to produce a valid and fair assessment on how the budget is spent. In the on-going reform process, the Commission is moving in the direction of a system of control and accountability. This has, I believe, been said by the President of the Court of Auditors in this House. The Commission is moving towards a system of accountability which will compare with the highest standards of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">An important point made again in the follow-up to the report is that 80% of the budget is actually administered by the governments of the Member States, while the Commission has final responsibility. A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States. The biggest problem still existing, as identified in our discharge motion for resolution, is the fact that, in the administration of the budget for the year 2000, there was under-utilisation of resources in the order of 14%. Again, we have commented on the recurrence of the same problem in the 2001 budget. This of course is a failure in the budgetary procedure but various comments have been made by different people and we have asked for a simplification of the regulations. I believe, however, that what is necessary is a simplification of regional policy and the bringing about of economic and social cohesion. The cohesion fund and the structural funds will have to be tailored to a more simplified policy if we are to pursue an efficient regional policy, particularly in the enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a policy that is in transition but rather a policy that we will have for the foreseeable future, particularly with the imminent enlargement, and we must simplify the whole policy so that these funds can be spent. We also took note of the failure of the Commission to collect from the national governments money unduly paid and we note an outstanding amount of EUR 2.2 billion. We are dealing with viable, solvent democracies and while we have to note that the age profile has become lower – the debt is not as old as it used to be – nevertheless, there is no good reason why EUR 2.2 billion should be outstanding. The question has also been raised in our follow-up about the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor. We have to underline once again that this is the policy of the Parliament; the Committee on Budgetary Control has called for it, with the support of Parliament, on many occasions. The national governments do not pursue the obligations to investigate frauds and abuses in relation to European money with the same efficiency that they apply to their own national budgets. While that persists, we will persist with our call for the appointment of our own prosecutor, who can look after our own resources and be seen to do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, honourable Members, Mr McCartin, last November, I had the opportunity to present to you the Commission's report on the measures we took following Parliament's resolutions on discharge in respect of the 2000 Budget. Mr McCartin has just mentioned that it ran to sixty pages, a fact that I had forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">I could describe to you in detail the many action plans that the Commission has conceived, implemented or already brought to a conclusion in its spheres of activity, which are very wide-ranging. The Commission attaches the greatest importance to Parliament's resolution – which now exists in draft form – on this report, and I am glad that the present resolution acknowledges the Commission's efforts to improve its financial management, and the steps it has already taken. In general, the draft resolution encourages the Commission to press on with the efforts it has made to date. At this point, I would like particularly to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for his good cooperation with the Commission. I would also like to thank him for the speech he has just made, for the substantial amount of time and effort he has expended on the report and for the in-depth attention he has devoted to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now briefly set out again the main steps that the Commission has taken with a view to improving financial management. I would like to start by discussing the implementation of reforms. The Commission has introduced a range of new instruments – what is termed ‘activity-based management’,<span class="italic"> </span>APS, that is, annual political strategic planning, and the annual management plans. In 2002, the Directors-General, for the first time, submitted annual activity reports, which also specifically included financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable, at this juncture, to list all the measures, but, among the priorities for 2002, I would like to give a special mention to the adoption of the new Financial Regulation and the drafting and adoption of the implementation provisions, along with the new financial regulations for the European Development Fund and also for the agencies. The new Financial Regulation reinforces the Budget principles, something constantly urged by the Court of Auditors and, I believe, something essential in a Financial Regulation. It gives the authorising officers an enhanced role and, above all, gives greater responsibility to the individual actors in financial activities, with the rules for procurement and the award of grants being tightened up and made uniform. These are just some of the essential points.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority for action in 2002 was the closure of the technical assistance offices, which we had the opportunity to discuss at the last meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control. In order to make its internal financial management more efficient, the Commission has also, with the budgetary authority's support, introduced a wide range of measures to modernise and improve public services, and, in particular, submitted to the Council proposals for a new version of the Staff Regulations. In addition to that, decisions have been taken on administrative and disciplinary measures, and we have set up the Commission's Investigation and Disciplinary Office – IDOC for short.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of crucial importance to financial management is the Commission's restructuring of its external service. In order to better approximate programme planning to political priorities, we have drawn up strategy documents relating to countries and regions, and the management of the project cycle as a whole will from now on be the responsibility of a single body, EuropeAid. The Commission has also stepped up the so-called deconcentration of powers in the administration of external aid, transferring them to its delegations in order to guarantee more speedy and, above all, sounder implementation of financial aid.</p>
<p class="contents">A second complex issue that I would like to deal with is that of the Budget surpluses, which Mr McCartin has also mentioned. The discrepancy between the payment forecasts for 2001 and the payments actually made by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund resulted, in essence, from the programmes for the new planning period having completed their initial phases rather more slowly than had been expected. An additional factor was that the payment forecasts submitted to the Commission by the Member States are often – if I may put it diplomatically – very optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the Budget year 2002, the Commission had frequent occasion to remind the Member States of their obligations in this regard, in doing which it gave particular emphasis to the importance of estimates being as reliable as possible. Let me, furthermore, follow Mr McCartin in making brief reference to the simplification of the rules of the Structural Funds. One of last year's priorities was to make the utmost use of the opportunities for simplification without going through the entire decision-making process, in other words to have recourse to whatever was administratively feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">With the general simplification of regulations and procedures in mind, the Commission has had recourse to a range of horizontal and sector-related initiatives, and it will now examine more closely, in the course of an <span class="italic">ex ante </span>evaluation of the effects of proposed legislation, which regulatory instruments are the best suited to the achievement of political objectives. The Commission will also draw up a comprehensive report on the realisation of its objectives – broken down by policy area – and will forward it to the Council and to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently – just before Christmas – the Commission also adopted a communication on improving the recovery of financial incentives provided in error from the European Budget. A task force, set up by OLAF and the Agriculture Directorate-General, is now at work dealing with the issue, mentioned by Mr McCartin, of what one may term the claims backlogs in the area of agricultural policy. I would like to underline the importance of the establishment of the internal audit service, which will monitor the control systems as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by mentioning that, in the Commission's view, our two institutions' framework agreement on the forwarding of confidential information has proved its worth and has – in accordance with the requirement for transparency – made it possible to provide Parliament with confidential information when the latter has requested this.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, my fellow-Commissioner Neil Kinnock will be putting before the Commission his latest report on the state of play as regards reform. This report had been called for by Parliament, and I think that it, too, will be a sound basis for discussion in the current discharge procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under expenditure is one of the most important. There was a budget surplus of 14% in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The figure for 2001 was 16%. This situation should be prevented by improving the assessment of budgetary needs and the evaluation of running policies in order to optimise value for money for the European taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of under expenditure is most worrying in the case of Structural Funds, in view of their objectives and of the important needs they address. Most recipients find the Regulations too complicated. In my view, applying the Regulations in a more flexible way could prove a solution to this difficulty. After all, the Structural Funds have a direct impact on citizens. Commissioner Barnier has already made several statements along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has requested, we should receive regular reports on progress in this area. It is essential to improve management of the recovery of unduly paid funds in order to improve budgetary control. The fight against fraud must be strengthened too. OLAF should report regularly on its actions, and should cooperate more closely with national courts of auditors and with the budgetary control authorities of Member States in order to assist the Commission in its work.</p>
<p class="contents">We will support the amendment tabled by Mr Blak aimed at improving access to documents. This would facilitate the work of the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to review the main issues concerning the common agricultural policy that I raised in the discharge of the 2000 Budget, whilst reminding you, as required by Rule 9(1) of our Rules of Procedure, of the fact that I am an olive-grower. The high risk and even the practical impossibility of effectively monitoring the operation of the export refunds system was our overriding concern at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to note that, in his first annual report on the general activities of the European Union, the Director-General for agriculture has corroborated our viewpoint, in expressing his two main reservations about the Budget for this mechanism: firstly, that the Commission has reduced and simplified the system of refunds in the beef and veal sector and, secondly, that it is committed to gradually reducing the use of these mechanisms in line with negotiations at the World Trade Organisation. We feel bound, nevertheless, to regret the maintenance of export refunds for sugar for European countries from which we import sugar freely, because this seems clearly to be asking for further instances of the same roundabout fraud already detected in the field of butter.</p>
<p class="contents">We note the Commission’s intention to invest in the research and development of means to detect the falsification of oil, but we are unhappy that we are still spending absurdly high sums and imposing extremely expensive schemes on national and regional administrations, and also on oil producers, to monitor the number of olive trees, without any concern to prevent fraud, in total contrast with the lack of means to prevent and combat the large-scale fraud against the Community Budget, consumers and farmers that the falsification of oil represents. The same scenario or worse can be seen, incidentally, in the wine, dairy and most livestock product sectors. I still find it unacceptable that farmers who exceed their milk quotas are heavily fined and yet nothing is done to penalise dishonest companies and criminal networks that produce dairy products without milk.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must state that the Commission’s refusal to name companies who are given export refunds and other subsidies on the pretext that this would contravene the provisions on the protection of the individual is totally unacceptable. This is a concept of citizens’ rights that operates only in the interests of multinationals and large business concerns and which does not exist to protect consumers or even farmers, who are frequently the victims of a diabolical and destructive bureaucratic machine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to express my sincerest thanks for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The way the EU budget is implemented is still unsatisfactory. This is particularly true of the way the Structural Funds programmes are implemented, which does not meet the requirements of good administration any more than it does the expectations of the public. The situation only got worse from 2000 to 2001 and the trend continued into 2002. In 2000, EUR 6.5 billion in Structural Funds appropriations remained unspent, in 2001 the figure was 10.5 billion, and last year it was 8.1 billion. The amount in unpaid commitments in respect of the Structural Funds has grown to EUR 66.7 billion, which is the equivalent of the budget for two years. The situation is very alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been totally incapable of improving its administration: indeed, the situation is entirely beyond remedy. The EU’s structural policy has to be thoroughly reviewed; this programming period threatens to be a real catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">The review of staff regulations that began in 2000 and is still going on is one of the most important of the reforms. In the opinion of my group it is important that the staff regulations should support the key objectives of administrative reform: improved efficiency, clarification of staff responsibilities with increased accountability, and the downward delegation of power. It must be the obligation of every official to apply the whistle blowing procedure where necessary. On the other hand, everyone must also be accountable for his or her actions in the sense that people must face the consequences of making groundless personal accusations. The European Union must not become a place of espionage.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be a more natural and swifter way to claw back EU funds paid out for no good reason. The present system is unwieldy and arbitrary, as is shown in the report by Jan Mulder, which we are to discuss next. Unfortunately, the Member States and the Commission are often on opposite sides of the negotiating table, even though they should really be on the same side.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the practice initiated by Mr McCartin of providing yearly follow-up with regard to the reports on discharge is appropriate, because it brings a long-term quality to Parliament’s monitoring of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur is giving the European Commission a pat on the head instead of the urgent stimulus that is needed to drastically improve management of the EU budget. This report makes the European Parliament dependent on the goodwill of the Commission instead of championing the interests of the many tax payers who want to see value for their money.</p>
<p class="contents">I was not happy to see that the Commission is stating that most of the irregularities and fraud involving EU money take place in the Member States themselves. That may be so, but the Commission has the duty to manage the EU funds and is ultimately responsible for them. Virtually all special reports from the European Court of Auditors contain the comment that European regulations are too complex and too vague, objectives are not clearly defined and control systems are deficient. We must be able to approach the Commission on these issues. Compare this with the board of directors of a multinational denying responsibility for the efficiency of business activities that take place away from their head office. I have yet to encounter a shareholder who would accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the way the budget is managed by the Commission leaves much to be desired. The enormous structural budget surplus, a milk quota rule dating back to 1984 that is still not working properly, the uncertainty about the effectiveness of most of the structural measures, the deficient bookkeeping that is a source of problems including the claiming back of amounts from EU funds that have been paid out in error. I could easily fill up this list with other examples that show that the European Commission still has a great deal to do before there is any chance of receiving a positive Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first relates to the amendment tabled by Mr Blak and the second to an overview of the report we are currently debating.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning my first point, I fully support Mr Blak’s amendment. In my view it is in line with the spirit of the EC Treaty. In particular, it accords with Article 276 referred to in Recital A of the report, whereby the Commission will, on request, supply Parliament with all necessary information.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive nature of the report makes it difficult to explain why a real restriction has been created in regulating this right to access documents, even though the restriction relates only to confidential documents. I therefore support this amendment. I trust the good offices of the legal services and the relevant committee will re-establish the validity of Article 276 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion the report before us is excellent. I have already had the opportunity of assessing the document within the Committee on Budgetary Control. I should point out, as the Commissioner has already, that 2000 was a transitional year. Major reforms were drawn up during that year. These reforms are gradually being implemented and we will be able to assess their impact in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the three sections of the report, I would like to draw your attention to that concerning management. I wish to highlight the issue of under expenditure, in particular as this concerns the Structural Funds. I welcome Commissioner Barnier’s initiative to simplify the Regulations in this regard. The current Regulations are one of the causes of under expenditure. The latter is detrimental to citizens’ rights and to the image of the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, regarding the issue of the recovery of unduly paid funds, I would like to highlight that these are Community funds. The same principle applies to the procedure in which it is clear that Parliament wishes to be involved in the financial management process. Parliament therefore requires all necessary information.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the fight against fraud, I especially welcome the reference to the European Prosecutor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the great surpluses in the 2000 Budget year came to light, the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, was quoted as saying, on 30 May 2001: ‘Such a large surplus is an exception. It means that, in the 2001 Budget year, the Member States will be required to remit markedly fewer own resources to the European Union, 81 billion etcetera instead of 90.9 billion. I regard this as thoroughly good news for the Member States.’ End of quote.</p>
<p class="contents">We know, Commissioner, that this was not an exceptional occurrence. The problem with this Budget surplus – for that is what we call it – is that the surpluses get bigger the longer the period lasts, or so we have been able to establish so far. So there is something intrinsically wrong with the system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not good news for anybody if we are not in a position to establish the reality of Europe's Budget. I am not going to stand up in front of the taxpayers and say, ‘I stand for a Budget totalling EUR 90 billion, provided that only EUR 80 billion is actually spent!’ That is not good budgeting! It is not you alone that I blame, Commissioner. I know that you are doing all that you can. We too, as the budgetary authority, have to do something, as do the Member States, but I tell you this: no Parliament with any self-respect, and committed to Budget reality can sit by and watch these things happening. In future, we will have to adjust the amounts and figures actually spent against what was originally planned, or the other way around. In the long term, that is just not on. In the long term, our citizens will not stand for it. That is the crucial point about this discharge procedure for the year 2000. As I have said, things got worse rather than better in 2001. This is something on which we have to work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
