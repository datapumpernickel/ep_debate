In other words, approximately half the plans are still pending, but it is important to emphasise that the plans notified already represent over 60% of the emission rights approved by the Commission for the first trading period. The Member States which have notified their plans are Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The remaining Member States must of course notify their plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of these plans – in a preliminary form – are already undergoing public consultation in various Member States such as Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Several of these Member States have already made significant progress in the relevant consultation procedures and they are expected to notify their plans to the Commission within the next few weeks. The Commission attaches great importance to the remaining Member States submitting their plans for the second stage as quickly as possible. Letters have already been sent out drawing the attention of the Member States to their obligations. If there are further delays, the Commission will examine the possibility of starting infringement proceedings against the Member States which have delayed, on the basis of Article 226 of the Treaty. However, according to the information available to it, the Commission estimates that the last Member States will have notified their plans by the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already started to evaluate the national allocation plans notified and intends to take decisions on them in the autumn, in other words by the three-month deadline from completion of the plans laid down in the emissions trading directive. This will allow the Commission to take decisions on most of the emission rights market before Christmas and to complete the evaluation procedure by the spring of 2007. This will safeguard the smooth and timely start of the second stage of the European Union's trading mechanism in all the Member States for 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot, of course, decide on the merits of evaluations under way, but will use every political and legal means at its disposal in order to ensure that all the plans are in keeping with the Kyoto commitments and the confirmed data on emissions for 2005, in a bid to safeguard equal terms of competition for companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lack of transparency in most Member State processes to determine their first NAPs has resulted in legitimate questions and concerns on the validity of the data within the first set of plans.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first year, 2005, the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated in those 21 countries. That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market. Will you insist that the information and data sources used to set the targets in the second round of NAPs will be publicly available to allow independent verification and to ensure maximum benefit for the climate and fair competition across the single market? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are 12 criteria; two are very important. The first is whether the Member States are on track to achieve the curtailment target and how the allocations for the emissions trading system, together with other measures, will contribute to the achievement of that target. The second is the available publicly-known data regarding the emissions. For the second trading period, we have the advantage that we have the actual emissions for 2005, which are as described previously. So these two criteria will be very important in making the National Allocation Plans achieve the scarcity that is needed in the market in order to give companies and installations incentives to make the right investment in cutting down carbon dioxide emissions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Nordic countries, there are common electricity markets, and the price of emission allowances has been passed on directly to the cost of electricity in the Nordic Power Exchange. It has also been passed on to the cost of nuclear and hydro-electric energy, and has produced windfall profits for producers in these sectors.

<p class="contents">There are two ways to fight that. One is by auctioning some of the allowances instead of allocating them for free. That is a possibility for the second trading period. Countries can auction approximately 10% of allocations and the proceeds could be used either to promote innovation or to lessen the burden of taxes for labour, for example, or for other purposes.

<p class="contents">My second point is that enlargement of the Schengen area is a crucial political priority for the European Union and it will remain so. I can confirm the Commission’s full commitment and my personal commitment to achieving this goal as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Some technical problems have emerged in this first phase of the technical implementation of this very complex system which, as you know, will connect the central part here in Strasbourg to all Member States’ national systems. There are problems and delays due to some litigation. There were technical problems with the preparation of the Strasbourg site, but these problems have now been totally solved in close cooperation with the French authorities. A large majority of Member States have requested at least an extra three months in order to test the connections needed between the central system and the national systems.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that agreement on the legal basis has not yet been reached. We are working very hard. A few days ago there was a very fruitful trialogue to try to secure an agreement between the rapporteur, the Council Presidency and myself.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of national projects has been delayed in all Member States that have asked to join the Schengen area, except one. All the experts in all Member States, including the new ones, were and are perfectly aware of the current situation. That is why national experts have proposed that there should be a new timetable for the implementation of SIS II.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week the Council of Interior Ministers will probably approve a new timetable for SIS II. It will approve a proposal for a new timetable, which will be visible, pragmatic and realistic, and will also decide to establish a task force formed by national experts from the Member States to monitor continuously the national implementation of national systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Following that, there will be a concrete possibility to discuss a realistic timetable. On the one hand, it is really a political commitment, but on the other, it is extremely complex from a technical point of view. The delay has occurred not because of political problems but because of technical problems, and all the Member States have been made aware of them through their national experts cooperating in the Technical Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would remind the honourable Members that over a year ago it was the Commission itself that put this idea forward. In other words, why not look for an intermediate solution between Schengen 1 and Schengen 2? Such a solution would in fact be called Schengen 1+.</p>

Now, as you know, the idea has been put forward again by the Portuguese delegation. We shall reassess it, but everything depends on the added value it provides.</p>
<p class="contents">The next question is, ‘What is this added value?’ Schengen 2 will feature immediate, real-time connection through a central part in Strasbourg, a second part in Salzburg and the national systems, which will be connected with direct exchange of information in much shorter times and with much more secure personal data protection than is the case at the moment.</p>

For example, I can take the IT scale systems into consideration. I have already postponed the possibility of spending money until the end of 2007. Why not think about postponing it again, or try to have additional funding for this extra cost?

The Court of Justice decided, however, that there were no grounds for imposing the fine requested by the Commission. After examining the events in question, it did not have sufficient information to conclude that the Italian authorities were failing to meet their obligations. The Commission would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the Court of Justice also pointed out that under Law 2/2004, which does not rule out renewing the careers of former assistant teachers of foreign language under enhanced conditions, each of the universities in question might retrospectively renew the careers of these teachers. The Court of Justice nevertheless also held that there was still a need to determine whether or not the measures adopted following the lawful approval of the regulation were actually applied. The Commission services are currently analysing the substance and impact of this ruling, and the best way to proceed. One of the main questions that should be resolved in this regard is whether the acquired rights have been fully recognised and renewed, including the implementation of retrospective payments to those who are entitled to them, as declared by the Italian authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this perspective we are both formally and substantively involved in the trial in question. Accordingly, the Commission is responsible for resolving this matter and for examining whether the ruling has been applied in full, whether it has resulted in retrospective payment and whether careers have been renewed. This is what we have to do and this is the direction in which we are heading. How the proposed measures will turn out remains to be seen. In my view, the bottom line is that the legal framework of the EU and the European Community must be respected, and this is the way the Commission always works. It made its position on the matter very clear during the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The criteria used in the regulation under law 2/2004 on renewing the careers of teachers were also called into question. At the time, of course, the court decided or stated that it had no reasonable grounds on which to establish that the ruling had not yet been applied in full. It took into consideration the fact that the Italian universities had informed them that payments, or at least some of the payments, had been made. The court did not address the issue that it was the universities that had provided this information and not the assistant teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, the decision of the court is final, and the Commission must now examine the relevant facts and decide on what action to take next. It remains to be seen whether the next step is to reopen the process or some other course of action. I can only assure you that the amount of time the process has taken strikes me, personally, as extraordinarily long and I feel that one of the cornerstones, one of the vital components, of legal certainty is that satisfaction ultimately ensues within a reasonable amount of time. This does not mean immediately, because some cases are complicated, but within a time frame that can be considered appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dalia Grybauskaitė, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> The question you asked is very important for the Commission and all the European institutions. The proposal we got from the Council consists of two parts: one part relates directly to the 2007 budget and the other relates directly to the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013. I should like to elaborate on the consequences in your question for both elements of the proposal that we got from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the 2007 budget, the Council has reduced appropriations by EUR 56 million. That means that the Commission would not even be able to maintain the current level of staff, while the Council has approved 801 new posts for new members for enlargement. However, it refused to grant the corresponding appropriations for paying salaries for those positions. It would make <span class="italic">any</span> recruitment impossible, from either new or old Member States. It also will not allow the Commission to replace its staff who will retire during 2007. That means that the real labour force will be reduced by about 420 people. No recruitment will be taking place at all with this proposal for 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The question was also about agencies. For 2007 the Council also proposed to cut agencies’ appropriations by about EUR 29 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the proposal consists of reducing posts for the seven-year period. The Council’s proposal has two parts. Firstly, every second post becoming vacant would be deleted from each institution’s establishment plan. I have heard rumours that it is proposed for all three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Secondly, the Commission would have to delete 500 additional posts, justified by the Council by the concentration of programmes and new managerial approaches. For the Commission that could cost up to 2000 positions during the seven-year period; for other institutions, such as the Council and Parliament, about 200 positions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, in early September I signed the working paper with all the detailed technical explanations and financial figures about that proposal. If you like, we could provide you today with that package for your information, in order to study the question in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences only for the Commission will be a loss of close to 2000 posts, which means close to four DGs. It is also approximately half of the positions that have been given for enlargement during previous years. It does not take into account at all the fact that the Commission already started administrative reform on its own premises in 2002 and its ongoing reform. It also does not take into account that the European institutions are not national governments and the specific tasks which Parliament and Council perform are different. As an example, the European Commission, as a public civil service, is the cheapest public service in the world. In our budget all three institutions – the Council, Parliament and the Commission – only take up about 5% of the budget for administrative expenditures, while in most of our Member States they take up four or five times more.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot agree because the proposal does not take into account the geographical balance. We need to keep within the requests of the Council. It does not take into account linguistic diversity, which we also need to keep. None of these things is taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we evaluated this as an attempt to reopen the debate on the interinstitutional agreement, which we signed just four months ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s administrative practice continues to display the regrettable feature that payment orders for scientific projects arrive far too late. This is especially true when a researcher or scientist comes to Brussels on an invitation from the Commission, for example, to evaluate research and scientific projects. Researchers pay for their own travel and hotel costs, make their contribution, and may have to wait several months before the Commission pays the expenses and pays for the work done.

<p class="contents">Your question mainly relates to our manning budget, where we are asking to create a budgetary line which would enable the Commission, where duly justified, to write off items in suspense accounts, and to write off losses which inevitably accrue in an administration manager’s funds in accounts throughout 145 countries, sometimes with a weak banking sector and other political disturbances.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of this budget line reflects the Commission’s policy of administrative rigour and transparency, to clear up all <span class="italic">old</span> files, mostly relating to the years before 2000. That is mainly because we are now introducing a new accrual-based accounting system which allows us, and compels us, to be more transparent and more rigorous with our accounting system.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a new budgetary line was presented in the amended Budget 5, to the budget line 40, and lists the following five types of operations which we will be looking into. The first is adjustments to cover amounts deposited in accounts in banks outside the European Union which have gone bankrupt during the previous year. The second is cash differences in imprest accounts. The third is settlement on some long-standing operations carried out mainly by delegations and representations under the imprest arrangements abroad. The fourth is repayments of principal and/or late payment interest and whether they were set off, and clearance of non-recoverable amounts of VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year, the Commission will include this budgetary line in its PDB proposal, as it is now common practice to write off non-recoverable expenditure and not leave it in suspense accounts indefinitely, which was the practice in the past. The definition of a suspense account is that it is not just a bank account, but accounting records, in which the Commission’s annual financial statements are listed outside the EU budget accounts because they correspond to operations which are waiting to be regularised from an accounting point of view, but cannot be attributed by any specific EU budget line for various reasons explained above. There is therefore no link with the bank accounts mentioned in my answer of 2 July this year, where the accounts were opened or managed by staff other than the accounting officer, both inside and outside the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Court of Auditors’ 2005 annual report, this proposal also has no link whatever with that publication, other than the fact that the Court constantly presses the Commission to clear up these suspense accounts. It was presented in good time for the suspense account to be cleared up before the end of the present financial year. We did this with the amended budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the main types of operation in a number of accounts which you ask about in your question and the amounts of money involved, I can provide some examples today. For example, funds lost following bankruptcies amount to about EUR 1.3 million, concerning mainly EUR 1 million in Kazakhstan in 1996. Funds lost from burdens of the past, for example, amount presently to EUR 3.5 million from imprest accounts held outside the European Union and only EUR 100 000 from imprest accounts held by representations. This is due to many different circumstances where the supporting documents that are needed to justify otherwise regular expenditure cannot be traced, despite long searches. All these amounts relate to years before 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say that the creation of this budget line is not only part of the current process to modernise the Commission’s accounting system; it also reflects the Commission policy of administrative rigour and transparency to clear up all old files, which will become common practice from 2006, and we will do it every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the thorough inventory, I want to confirm that no bank accounts were found that have been unknown to the Commission at this stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The problem of the 'brain drain' in the new EU Member States</span></p>
<p class="contents">Internal borders and barriers in the EU are being removed and will have disappeared completely after a few years. Ever closer integration between new and old EU Member States is giving rise to a ‘brain drain’ – an exodus of minds and of qualified workers – that is steadily gathering pace. The new Member States are losing many of their most dynamic citizens, who obtained a good education and qualifications in their native countries, to the considerably wealthier old Member States. The EU would appear to be giving the new Member States support with one, visible hand, in the form of various funds, while taking it away with another, invisible hand by attracting its young specialists.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a solution to this problem would be to create a special EU fund to lessen the impact of the brain drain (following the example of the globalisation fund). Countries receiving qualified specialists would have to contribute most to this fund. The resources collected could be used to improve the education systems of the countries adversely affected by this phenomenon and to create new jobs in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission’s view of this or similar suggestions? Does the Commission agree that what is essentially a positive process – the creation of a single labour market – is at the same time causing a serious problem in the form of a brain drain, which needs to be resolved by joint EU efforts as well as by the efforts of all 25 Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> The Member's question is on the issue of the brain- or skills-drain from Member States that joined the Union on 1 May 2004. He suggests that the Commission should create a special new fund to reduce the impact of brain-drain.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Community law. After enlargement in 2004, despite the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers from eight new countries, the EU saw increased mobility from new Member States. However, in the report we published recently on the functioning of the transitional arrangements, the Commission pointed out that flows from the EU-10, the new Member States, had been fairly limited in relation to the overall working-age population and that they are balanced, at least in part, by mobility from the original 15.</p>
<p class="contents">The report shows that migration flows are driven by factors related to supply and demand conditions, both in sending and receiving countries. Moreover, and more importantly, as pointed out in the report, rather than seeking permanent employment in another country, a significant percentage of migrant workers stay in the receiving country for a limited period only. Consequently, migrant workers often return to their country of origin, which will subsequently profit from the accumulated experiences gained abroad, especially by highly skilled workers. In this respect, we can speak about the concept of brain-gain.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be noted that although the ‘old’ Member States attract talented people from the new Member States, the United States of America proves to be the most popular destination for tertiary students or educated people from the new Member States. The problem of brain-drain, insofar as it exists, seems more linked to the salary differential between the country of origin and destination countries than to the quality of the education systems in migrants’ countries of origin. The new Member States perform quite well under most indicators in the Education-Training 2010 programme, where we have benchmarks and very concrete objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to the issue lies in the good use of the significant opportunities that will be provided by the structural funds for the 2007 to 2013 period. The structural funds will bring a substantial contribution to the economies of new Member States and, if used well, should provide the means to ensure steady growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The progressive convergence of the new Member States’ economies with those of older Member States should reduce the existing salary differential and therefore eliminate a major reason for brain-drain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, rather than supporting the creation of a special fund or efforts to regulate migration, would therefore encourage new Member States to use the structural funds effectively. The European Social Fund, in particular, will continue to support a comprehensive approach to education and training in the programming period beginning in 2007, namely by supporting measures to develop employability and improve the labour-market relevance of initial and vocational education and training, with a view to encouraging innovation and as part of a knowledge-based economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we speak about the ‘brain drain’, it is not only the new Member States versus older Member States. The same happens in the Union versus most competitive partners in the world. When I was in France and Germany they talked about the brain drain to the United States. So either we are aware of the problems and the lack of competitiveness, the lack of value placed on knowledge or the lack of respect for knowledge in Europe, and improve conditions for intellectual property for patents on this continent for so many issues connected to innovation and the transfer of knowledge into real life, the real economy, production and services, or we will comment and lament later on, and maybe even more, because time is passing quickly and globalisation is really influencing our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">All our policies, programmes, strategies aim towards this goal. I do not want to anticipate developments in the Commission, but in a few weeks’ time we would like to propose, for example, the establishment of a European institute of technology. Either we create space for a European dimension in knowledge and the transfer of knowledge and we improve together or, as I said before, we will lose time and momentum. I do not want to discuss that at length now, maybe next time I shall say more. The Lahti Summit in October should deal with the ten points for improving innovation in Europe. The first two points are education and universities and an institute of technology, and then there are others.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that political awareness of the problem is there. If there is also the political will to deliver, we can find better answers and better situations in the future. We need to work towards that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Politically I think Europe is a synonym of openness. If that is true, then we usually tend to solve problems. If we close, if we isolate ourselves, then problems usually get even bigger in time. On internal decisions and the opening of the labour market, this is, of course, the right of Member States. The Commission has always argued in favour of openness or at least gradual opening rather than moratoria. The report on the second anniversary of enlargement showed that those that opened their markets benefited, which confirms that until now integration in Europe has proved to be a win-win situation. Of course it must be carried out under certain rules and criteria and, if that is the case, then benefits will continue to be gained by those who are more open.</p>
<p class="contents">On qualifications and integration, one of the important contributions will come this month from the Commission. Last night there was a debate in this House on a European qualifications framework, which should create the basic matrix for comparison and transfer of qualifications between different autonomous national qualification systems or qualification frameworks. In this sense the value of the qualifications will be higher because we will make them more readable and transferable and we will empower people to use them more properly. This is one of the most important legal and political answers in order to turn our people in the same Union into citizens more than tourists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many examples of how either we proceed together in order to release the potential which we have in our Member Sates and our universities in the new generation of students and researchers, or we are lost with the lack of growth, the lack of new and better jobs. Even in the programmes for which I am responsible, we do not stimulate or motivate third-country nationals to leave their home states, but rather to go back and build up their societies and economies in close partnership with European countries, European institutions or universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of lamenting how little we did to stop the brain drain and for the recuperation of European potential, we should focus on the credible implementation of our next generation of programmes. We want to have even more mobility combined, of course, with freedom. I am also from a new Member State, and I usually answer that instead of lamenting that more young people go out than come back, we need to create conditions which build or offer a truly European perspective back home in Slovakia, in Lithuania or Latvia. After two years of membership of the Union, it is becoming more and more evident that the Europeanisation of conditions and prospects for young people is there, but it is a process; it takes time. The much-quoted, miraculous examples of Ireland or Finland are just logical results of long-term strategic policies where education, training, knowledge and research are at the centre and remain at the centre.

On the contrary, it is commonly agreed that money spent on acquired language skills ensures a good return to the individual, his or her family, companies and society at large in terms of higher salaries, better jobs and increased business opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, more than 50% of European citizens stated that they are able to hold a conversation in one foreign language. That percentage is encouraging, although it is far from our objective of giving all European citizens the ability to communicate in at least two other languages in addition to their mother tongue. To pursue that objective, the Commission promotes language learning and linguistic diversity through its programmes for education and training as well as through many other exchange programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Lingua 1 action under the Socrates Programme is aimed at developing and disseminating innovative techniques and examples of good practice in language teaching. Furthermore, the European Label for innovative projects in language teaching and learning is awarded each year to the most innovative language learning projects in each Member State. The Commission is bound by its legal obligation to translate into all official languages Community legislation and the related documents that are necessary to enable citizens, companies and other stakeholders to enjoy their rights and comply with their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards other documents, they are translated in accordance with real needs, taking into account available capacity. That principle applies to all official languages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first annual report by the coordinator, Mr Davignon, published on 13 September, states that there may be delays in the implementation of the section in question. The completion of this section is made more difficult by the presence of protected areas and very built-up residential areas. On confirmation from the French authorities, it appears that the delays should be far more limited than the ones you have pointed out. While it is unlikely that we will be able to keep to the date of 2015, the date of 2020 for the entry into service of this infrastructure seems entirely realistic, and it might even be conceivable that the section will be completed before then.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework, the Commission wants to focus a significant proportion of the Community resources available on the 30 priority projects. Mr Guardans Cambó, in its amended proposal for a regulation laying down the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid, the Commission envisages paying special attention to projects concerned with the elimination of bottlenecks, with the cross-border sections and with the waterways, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I must insist, Mr President, Mr Guardans Cambó, that Parliament permit the swift adoption of this financial regulation, thanks to which we will be able more swiftly to put in place the funding and to speed up the implementation both of this priority project No 3 and of other projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States are not bound to transmit information relating to the management of complaints from air passengers or to the penalties imposed on airline operators.

<p class="contents">I should like to tell you, Mr Tarabella, that the Commission has recorded more than 5 500 letters linked to air passenger rights. These letters are handled carefully. They enable certain trends to be identified. This entire monitoring exercise will be used in the context of the infringement proceedings that the Commission will bring against Member States that do not fulfil their obligations to citizens and respect the rights of those citizens as air passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we can bring those proceedings, however, we must have enough data. During the 18 months of implementing this regulation, the Commission will have collected a critical mass of information and it will be in a position to act when the right moment comes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to you for your question because I, for my part, am really very anxious to ensure that these passenger rights now become a reality within the European area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the meantime, we have established a question-and-answer-type information document that will make it easier for the national control bodies to deal with the data on a daily basis. This document was distributed in July 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said to you, Mr Tarabella, thanks to this critical mass of information, I could actually propose, with the communication that I am going to present before Parliament in prospect, a number of improvements enabling us to ensure that the new law that we have created to benefit passengers is properly applied. I would say to you once again: the Directorate-General for Transport has handled 5 623 letters, which means that we can already identify certain trends.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, for example, that we were pleased to observe a sharp decline in the practice of overbooking.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, though: the events that took place this summer must also be taken into account. Once I truly have an overall view of things, I hope to be able to come before this Parliament and to explain to it both what improvements have been made and what remains for us to do to ensure that these new rules are applied effectively.</p>

I understand that they are the ones that have to tell passengers what their rights are, but in various instances, with Air France in particular, we are told that it is not up to the airline operator. What is the Commission doing to make sure that airline operators take their responsibilities seriously? I had to intervene on behalf of several passengers because they were told that they would not get overnight accommodation, for instance. I told them that was wrong and that the new law said that they were entitled to that compensation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You are quite right. It is not just a question of passengers having rights; it is a question of airline operators and the national authorities being able to really make the people concerned aware of those rights. Moreover, the study will be conducted in cooperation with airline operators, consumer and passenger associations, and the national authorities.</p>
