<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mann, Thomas </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, numerous academic studies and publications by employers' associations, organisations representing small and medium‐sized businesses, trade unions and public institutions have served as the basis for my report on jobs of the future in Europe. I am grateful to my colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights for their amendments, most of which I have incorporated into the report. In the brochures I have obtained, even the glossiest of them, I find only a catalogue of achievements. There are no visions or specific statements of intent for the next 10 to 15 years. Globalisation, fierce international competition and ever shorter lifespans for innovations and decisions are resulting in deep‐seated insecurity for everyone, from managers to part‐time staff.</p>
<p class="contents">The hearing organised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in which the Union of the Industries of the European Community (UNICE), the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and the European Union of Crafts and Small and Medium‐Sized Enterprises (UEAPME) took part, also made it clear that the current structural transformation is moving too fast to permit any long‐term forecasts. What are the trends that might influence the jobs of the future? First of all, as we enter the information and knowledge society, we shall need suitably qualified employees. They must have facts at their fingertips, they must keep educating themselves, even in their spare time, and they must be able to master technological equipment. Once they have amassed a wide range of knowledge, they will be able to move from one discipline to another, switching from the occupation for which they were initially trained to another occupation and repeating that process three or four times in the course of their working lives. They will have to be specialists and all‐rounders at the same time, and will have to acquire key skills such as in‐house communication, public relations, creativity and the skills of conflict resolution. As hierarchical structures dissolve and staff assume an increasing amount of responsibility, they must also be good team players. They must be multilingual and able to empathise with foreign cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">School curricula and training programmes in the Member States will have to be reformed so as to emphasise knowledge of applied technology, educational breadth, new career profiles and the mentality of lifelong learning. It is not only wrong to demand too much of people; it is also wrong to expect too little of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to achieve high employment potential, in addition to these multiskilled employees there will be an increase in the number of job opportunities which involve the performance of basic tasks. These are required in manufacturing and in labour‐intensive industries. Millions of people will obtain this type of work and will contribute to gains in productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I cannot share the euphoric vision in which the service sector appears as an indestructible generator of jobs, because not every job that is done without payment today can be transformed into external paid employment. Demand for services provided by regions and individuals will certainly increase. These include care services, from the training of carers and care management to care of the elderly, home care and health care in hospitals and nursing homes. Some services are business‐related, ranging from insurance to corporate services; others are distributive, such as transport and communications; household‐related services include retailing and catering, while other services relate to the social sector, covering areas such as employment and personal finance.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism will be a strong growth area, from travel agencies marketing products designed for specific target groups to rural and cultural tourism. To pave the way for new entrants to these jobs of the future in the Member States, the European Commission will need to launch initiatives but must, of course, respect the principle of subsidiarity at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there are good prospects in the fields of biopharmaceuticals and agricultural biotechnology, although public acceptance must be secured before these industries can take off. No such controversy, however, attaches to systematically applied environmental technology, in which we Europeans already lead the field. Considerable growth should be seen in research and development, which are the source of the innovative products and processes that enable companies to secure niches in the world market. The TIME industries – telecommunications, information technology, the media and electronics – will be among the beneficiaries of the changing employment structure as networking and decentralisation take hold.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are three priorities with regard to sustainable jobs in the European Union. First of all, European support programmes – and this, Mr Flynn, is addressed to the European Commission – must be maintained in the long term without any reduction in their volume. These include start‐up programmes, schemes designed to enhance the competitiveness of SMEs and measures whereby women, who are still a disadvantaged group, can upgrade their qualifications and enjoy real equality of opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the flexibility that is required for the jobs of the future demands a reorganisation of the work process. There is a need for more company agreements to be concluded, providing for such things as part‐time arrangements designed to enable parents to reconcile their occupational and family responsibilities, as well as proper social protection and childcare facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, instead of merely considering how to share out the existing workload among more people, the Member States must launch education and training campaigns. The current presidency of the Council would do well to give up the idea of an EU‐wide alliance for work, which is still a nebulous concept, and replace it with a far more meaningful and, what is more, an achievable alliance for the future. Millions of people, especially those who are marginalised and unemployed as well as young, experienced and women employees, are waiting for this ambitious step towards a new dawn.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Weiler </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not understand your last comment at all, Mr Mann. There is absolutely nothing contradictory in the fact that the alliance for work which the German Federal Government is pursuing nationally, and which it is pursuing at European level during its presidency, is a useful contribution to employment growth. So I am quite amazed by your comment because, as you know, we support your report in principle. We also support your proposals on the environmental orientation of future economic activity and on the sabbatical year, and we hope that your group will not succeed in watering down the content of your report.</p>
<p class="contents">We see your report as a tile in the mosaic of the parliamentary quest for more employment, as part of the continuous process that we have been pursuing in Parliament for the past four years through the employment policy we initiated, through the Amsterdam employment summit and through the Luxembourg guidelines, despite some governments having dropped the occasional spanner into the works. I also think you were right to include in your report the Commission's critical assessment of the national action plans, because there is little point in our being unwilling to learn from past mistakes. But I am pleased, and I take the liberty of stating it here, that the priorities of the German Presidency will be the fight against youth unemployment and female unemployment. This was not such a matter of course in Germany as you have implied.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the proposals contained in your report regarding the various means of creating sustainable jobs, and particularly the two main avenues. The first of these is the redistribution of existing work. That is hardly a new proposal, but we should not underestimate it in the context of a democratic society which enables mothers to hold down a job and which allows fathers to fulfil other social responsibilities besides their paid employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the second avenue of strengthening growth potential and improving basic conditions also requires special support. By this, of course, I mean support for new business activities, for the tertiary sector, care services and, needless to say, for our great hope for the future, the SMEs. By basic conditions I do not mean the supply‐side policies that some countries have been pursuing, but the conditions for a modern system of education and vocational training. I was also pleased to hear Mrs Edelgard Bulmahn, the German Federal Minister of Education and Research, emphasising to our committee that many Member States – including Germany, unfortunately – have education systems that are not Europe‐friendly, not to mention their systems of further education, which are essentially at odds with the objectives we always proclaim in connection with lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect is undoubtedly the acquisition of key skills, team skills and holistic thinking; we agree on that, and you know that I laid particular stress on the need for the men of our society to learn this kind of team skill. I also thank Mrs Bulmahn for her pledge that Germany for one would be doubling its education and research budget over the next five years. That, of course, is a signal by which we shall judge her. We all know that the transfer of knowledge between the academic world and industry, in terms of real exploitable discoveries, is far too slow and that in many Member States it falls far short of what is required. Our best bet in the initial stages, of course, is to support small and medium‐sized businesses, which are the most powerful generators of new employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention one other target group that is often neglected in this debate, namely the foreigners who live with us in our EU Member States and whose enterprising spirit has done a great deal to provide additional employment. Let me say here that I consider it a scandal that in my home state of Hesse, foreigners are currently being subjected to an unacceptable campaign of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the lack of emphasis on what women can do in small and medium‐sized businesses. Their innovative capacity and their creativity are simply not able to come to the fore in the real world. I believe the European Union should provide special support for enterprising women who want to start up in business.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pronk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Mann for his report. I think he has made a good attempt to focus attention on a number of new sectors in which jobs can be created. He mentioned small businesses. He also mentioned the need to learn. ‘Learn, learn, learn" is the title I would like to give his report, because we can only create enough jobs if we have a population capable of meeting the challenge of the new technologies. I think that is a most important point to make, and his report makes it.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the PPE Group of course support this report most warmly, but it is naturally something of a compromise. I think Mrs Weiler is right in calling it a mosaic. I have to say that some of the pieces added to the mosaic are worth rather less than others. The bits added by the rapporteur himself are rather better than those put in later, and that is a danger.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was learning German, I had a little book entitled <span class="italic">Schwere Wörter</span> – difficult words ‐the differences between German and Dutch. What we are getting at the moment from the German Government are <span class="italic">schöne Wörter</span> – fine words. No new deeds. At most it is going as far as the previous government went, but no further. Absolutely nothing new is being done in real terms. But the language used is splendid. Old ideas are being dressed up in splendid new words. But we are interested in deeds, in action. I think it is important that the rapporteur has emphasised the need for action, for real and new jobs here and not various kinds of redistribution and other solutions, and not the fine words of the Federal Chancellor. What we need is action, and it is on this that we shall ultimately be judged.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindqvist </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, jobs are the Achilles" heel of the EU. The economy and competition have dominated cooperation in the EU for far too long. EMU has become a kind of mantra for the Member States which has pushed them into fighting inflation, meeting the convergence criteria, reducing their budgets and cutting back public spending, at the expense of creating new jobs. From a European perspective, these things are important, but the approach is too narrow and one‐sided. EMU is actually making it more difficult to increase the number of jobs in the future. I believe that peace, employment and the environment are the only areas by which our European citizens set great store.</p>
<p class="contents">The sections of the Amsterdam Treaty devoted to employment are commendable. The approach should be based on intergovernmental cooperation, with objectives and guidelines set at European level and the possibility of coordinating national efforts. A good way for countries to do this would be by adopting sound ideas from other countries, for example variable taxation, shorter working hours and time off for study or training.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise the fact that transport, the environment and energy are the sectors of the future. I should for example like to see the EU, together with the Member States, making a substantial investment to ensure that, over the next ten years, petrol is replaced by environmentally friendly fuels, creating a large pool of environmentally friendly jobs in the process. There is a market for vehicles powered by ethanol, methanol, electricity and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Last summer, I visited a company in central Sweden: a small paper mill with 300 employees. I asked the managing director what his biggest problems were in terms of the workforce. I was anticipating that they would be pay, taxes and EU rules, but he told me that above all people wanted to know about schools, childcare, medical facilities and communications. Basic public services are absolutely crucial when creating new jobs in many places, not least the northern part of Europe. The Liberal Group supports this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Crowley </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to welcome, very warmly, the report by my colleague, Thomas Mann, because it looks to the future and that is what we are talking about. Not trying out failed systems of the past, not trying out failed mechanisms of the past, but dealing with the reality of what we are presented with. Despite the risks and the dangers which new advances and new technologies present, they also offer us a wonderful new opportunity to correct some of the errors of the past, to be more socially cohesive within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of mention has been made within the report and by colleagues speaking here tonight, and I am sure the Commissioner will also touch on it, about the importance of lifelong learning and education. There is a very old saying ‘Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed him for life". By investing more of our resources into giving real education and real training to our people then we can guarantee that they will benefit from the huge explosion in job creation opportunities which will be presented.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are dangers relating not just to individual actions taken by Member States but also to the question of tax harmonisation, about increasing taxation. That is the biggest disincentive to investment which will hit job opportunities. No longer can we have a huge state sector which will automatically take the overflow from the unemployed and give them meaningless jobs. People now demand that they must have a meaningful role to play in life, with dignity. If that requires them working part‐time, so be it. If it requires bringing more women back into the workplace, so be it. Nobody should be denied the opportunity to ensure that they can play their full role in life. But likewise, nobody should be forced, out of necessity, out of poverty, to take up a job opportunity that is not suitable for them. Let us focus on education, let us work together for the common good.</p>

An employment pact, rather than an alliance for goodness, beauty, truth or other intangible values, seems to me to be the proper step for us to take at this time. There is much in Mr Mann's report that we are able to endorse, and we are opposed to any attempt by the PPE to emasculate it, but there are also a few points in it which are rather unclear. So that we can have these points clarified, I shall try to present them systematically.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two possible sets of measures. Additional demand for work can be created. This can be achieved by means of an employment‐oriented economic policy, by restructuring society and the tax system in line with environmental objectives, and by developing the tertiary sector to create social tasks which are necessary but which the market does not perform. The second set of measures is designed to cut back the available volume of work. This can be achieved by redistributing the workload, reducing working hours, introducing part‐time work, reorganising the work process, cutting the supply of work to employees by granting individual and collective rights to leave of absence and by granting sabbatical leave, which Mr Mann had in his report but which his group now wishes to delete. This training measure has the dual effect of improving the quality of human resources after the sabbatical year and drastically reducing the available labour pool during it. These measures can be taken, and we can close the labour gap in the European Union: 27 to 34 million, the Commission has calculated. To do this, however, we must consciously address the problem, and for that we need a very substantive employment pact, not just a finely worded document. We are in agreement on that.</p>

It is a report which has not confined itself to simply expressing our concerns or to obtaining the unanimous approval of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (our concerns necessarily involve opposing exclusions from the current development model), but has put forward certain solutions which have already been mentioned such as work‐sharing. However, we all know that work‐sharing is an approach that produces immediate but inadequate results given the scale of the problem. We therefore have to find new ways of tackling this problem by recognising that we need to establish companies rooted in the people which, as has already been said, can help to solve the problems of the elderly, of community services and of the environment and which can be recognised and compensated in tax terms. Companies involving the people and rooted in the people have a new role which must be welcomed and encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the social security systems are now playing a role which they are unable to fulfil and for which they were not created. Never, since the post‐war years, have so many depended so much on these systems, either totally or partially, and they cannot withstand the pressure. Therefore, only employment can produce appropriate, reliable and genuine social integration. Jobs must be created and this means achieving agreement and cooperation on investment, because jobs which appear only in social statistics, which have no social quality, which have no future and which are inappropriate forms of social interaction between people are surely not the European social model which we want to build. Therefore, it is not with jobs ‘for statistics" that we will solve the problems, nor can quick fixes of training and work help us to tackle this mosaic which has to be sorted out.</p>
<p class="contents">We look to the Commission, knowing that, with the White Paper, we have overcome the obstacle of indifference. It is time to act!</p>

<p class="contents">In any event, be that as it may, I think this report is particularly important for two reasons. The first reason is that we are in a period of very rapid developments. We are in the age of globalisation, biotechnology, the information society, and it is essential and important for the European Parliament to look at the issue we are considering today, jobs for the future. The second reason is unemployment, which is the scourge of the working population in the European Union in particular, and that is therefore yet another reason to consider how to deal with the developments that are coming and which are before us.</p>
<p class="contents">In a free economy, it is clear that the state cannot foresee exactly what is going to happen. It can, however, do two things. Firstly, it can support flexible, up‐to‐date and effective systems for the training and retraining of working people so as to keep pace with developments; and, secondly, it can put emphasis on language education, which also encourages the mobility of working people, especially in the context of the common market.</p>
<p class="contents">Above and beyond that, it is clear that the sectors to which attention should be turned, even in an indicative way, can be identified. And here, quite rightly I think, the report points out that, firstly, one such sector is information technology and the electronics industry; a second sector, and one of particular interest to my own country, is tourism, agri‐tourism and more generally the leisure industry. Thirdly, emphasis should be placed on the tertiary sector, the provision of services. It is clear that this sector will grow at the expense of the secondary sector; and, of course, a fourth sector comprises small and medium‐sized enterprises, which are much more flexible and can create many jobs, as has been demonstrated.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Heinisch </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to raise three points. A major problem group throughout the European labour market of the future will consist not only of young people and adults without any training qualifications at all, but also those whose training qualifications are outdated or irrelevant. Vocational training and further education systems must be adapted ever more rapidly to changing employment structures. Joint efforts by the Member States to introduce innovations in this sector seem to hold the greatest promise. Leonardo II in particular will offer excellent opportunities for cooperation in education and training, and it is imperative that these opportunities should be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the people of Europe have hitherto made little use of the single European job market. A mere 2 % have been living and working for any length of time in a Member State other than their own. Jobseekers are still too frequently unaware of employment opportunities beyond their national borders, and obstacles to the mobility of trainees and labour have still not been removed. Initiatives such as EURES and Citizens First are steps in the right direction, but are not yet the complete answer. It is up to Parliament, the Commission and the Council to launch new initiatives. One particularly useful development has been the introduction of the Europass Training document, which guarantees the transparency of vocational qualifications acquired abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, additional employment opportunities can be created in Europe if new businesses are set up on the basis of innovative technology, new marketing potential or new service functions. This, however, depends on young people in particular being able to take full advantage of these assets. Even during initial training and then in the course of lifelong learning, entrepreneurship and knowledge of business practices must be imparted and encouraged. At the same time, however, it is also necessary to eliminate excessive legal regulation, financial obstacles and information gaps. The availability of venture capital, for example, is a key factor here. Finally, may I again express my very sincere thanks to Thomas Mann for his excellent report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago, the unemployment rate dipped below 10 % for the first time in several years. That is encouraging, but let us not rest on our laurels. In particular, it would seem important to highlight positive trends and future job markets. Thomas Mann's excellent report is especially valuable in this sense. He quite rightly states that employers have an obligation to ensure the continuous training of their employees. The point here is that the ability of staff to apply the latest specialised knowledge will primarily serve the interests of their employer. That is why lifelong learning must be at the forefront as the prime instrument with which we can increase the level of employment throughout the Union, because only consumers can create jobs. For this reason, it is essential to supply products and services that will actually be bought.</p>
<p class="contents">Care should also be taken to ensure that when a company changes hands there is a possibility of securing the jobs of the existing staff and subsequently expanding the workforce. The report also refers to the fear that technological change could result in more redundancies than new jobs. We must work resolutely and systematically to allay those fears. The information society, for example, is the most dynamic economic sector in the European Union. It already accounts for 5 % of our total GDP, is growing faster than every other sector and is creating more jobs too. More than four million people are already employed by companies in the field of information and communications technology. More than 300 000 new jobs were created in this area of the information society between 1995 and 1997. But this potential has not been exhausted by any means. There are still about 500 000 vacancies for ICT specialists. Opportunities abound. All we have to do is take them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schiedermeier </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as the last speaker on this item, let me examine the problem under a slightly different light. What are jobs with a future? The crucial thing is not the type of work that will be done, but rather whether jobs will still be available in the future. The way I see it, some of the jobs of the future already exist. And so what I should like to analyse is why these jobs of the present have a future. That is not even a difficult task. The management team or, in smaller businesses, the manager, must be quick to recognise market openings for their products and services and must adjust their range rapidly to keep up with customer demand. To that end they require employees who are well trained, highly motivated and always prepared to undergo further training. Such workforces do not grow on trees. They need to be well treated, well informed and well paid. Greater flexibility is more essential than ever today, but it must be a two‐way flexibility that benefits not only the company but its employees too.</p>
<p class="contents">Modern workday patterns must not be detrimental to employees, as the latest example from the Volkswagen works in Wolfsburg illustrates. Duties at work must not exclude anyone from his or her own family or from society. National governments must play their part with a balanced taxation system, including tax relief where necessary, and must not capitulate under pressure, as in the case of your new government's DEM 630 legislation, Mrs Weiler. So much for my basic analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Inadequate school education, a lack of vocational training, an absence of further education and insufficient skills prevent many people from obtaining employment. Discrimination against the older age groups and against disabled people must henceforth be prohibited by law. We in Europe should learn from one another in this field. The rapporteur, Thomas Mann, has made many good proposals. The latest technological developments and in particular the service sector offer opportunities for the creation of secure, sustainable employment in which women and men would enjoy real equality. I am all for defending the welfare state in the market economies of Europe, but I reject any attempt to spoonfeed people, because that could prevent the creation of jobs with a future.</p>

Thank you Mr Mann. It follows on, of course, from the Commission's employment rates report of 1998 which identified the constraints on Europe's employment performance and the sectors where employment is lagging behind in Europe. I welcome many aspects of the report and, for example, that the resolution identifies the high road for Europe. We should expand our capacity to provide high quality products and services which are at the forefront of technological change and which lead to high quality jobs. The emphasis is given to the potential which exists to increase employment and services; the need to reform education and training systems and to allow for lifelong learning; the emphasis that needs to be given to women in employment policy and the importance of targeting small and medium sized enterprises in employment policy; the call for involvement of the social partners in the formulation of training policy and the calls for greater links between industry and sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Commission is called upon to act on a number of points in this resolution and I would like to make the following brief comments, if I may. In Paragraph 21 the resolution mentions the Philoxenia programme. This is a tourism programme which was proposed by the Commission in 1996 but which has still not been approved by the Council. Let me clarify that the Commission has not withdrawn the proposal and has no intention of doing so. I believe that the German Presidency may discuss it.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Paragraph 24, within the framework of the Employment and Labour Market Committee, the Commission has launched a series of peer reviews which aim at identifying good practice in employment policies in the Member States. The results of this peer review will be included in the 1999 joint employment report. Lessons drawn from this review will be used in the drafting of the employment guidelines. I would like to make the point, however, that specific policies to be carried out in each Member State are normally best determined at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">In Paragraphs 32 and 33 I welcome that the Parliament recognises women as a special target group. Women's unemployment is higher than that of men and the level of employment is also much lower. Community action in favour of employment of women already exists, of course, both in the Community initiative NOW and in the mainstream European Social Fund, Objective 3. But more can be done and more has been proposed in the reform of a social fund which is now being negotiated. The new fund will include specific action for women to allow them to fully exploit new job opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards working time, dealt with in Paragraph 16, the formulation given by the Parliament in its resolution embodying Parliament's proposal to the Luxembourg job summit, adopted in October 1997, reflects what should be the position at European level. It is stated, and I quote ‘that Member States need to address the issue of promoting flexibility on the labour market with regard to working hours, working time and working patterns, such as career breaks and sabbaticals, etc, through a non‐legislative, non‐compulsory process based on social dialogue at the level of the individual enterprises". I would like to say to Mr Mann that he is right when he says that portfolio jobs will be the order of the future, three and four changes in a lifetime. That can only be accomplished, Mr Mann, by emphasis on lifelong learning, by saying what Mr Crowley said, that we have to have a different situation for education and training so that everybody can participate in the labour market.<br />I would like to say to you, Mrs Weiler, that it is my understanding that there will be a much strengthened German national action plan. That is my understanding, having been to Bonn and spoken to the German government on this particular issue. They are focusing extremely highly on the question of young unemployed people and the question of women in the labour market. The key point in so far as the strengthening of the German plan, is going to be that they are putting up the money, the millions and billions of deutschmarks, to satisfy the implementation of the guidelines. That is what we want to see from the implementation in every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I understand very well, Mr Pronk, what you are saying about new services and the interesting thing about it is, of course, that there is a huge gap. But it is not in agriculture or manufacturing or the public sector. It is in the services sector, the communal services, the business services, distribution of services and the whole question of leisure. It is there that we have fallen behind the United States and we have to make up that difference because our employment rate has been falling for the past 25 years. But it cannot happen, Mr Lindqvist, unless there is a huge resource put into child care and the means to bring all of the resources of the labour market to bear and that includes giving much more attention to women.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to you, Mrs Heinisch, that the question of mobility is a key element here, in so far as the European labour market is concerned. We do not have a good record here but we are putting in place in the EURES network, a system that is making it possible for people to move more easily around the Union and hopefully bring about a situation where that mobility can be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, half a million jobs are vacant this evening in the European Union in the information society and in technology. Your are quite right, Mr Rübig, half a million jobs. But the industry tells me that in five years it will be 1.2 million vacancies in Europe that we cannot fill. I say that the only way that we can come to grips with this is to change, Mrs Weiler, and reform the education and training systems so that the technology that is here today, which will be obsolete in ten years time, is matched up by an educational system, Mr Crowley, that will allow everybody to particpate and everybody to have a chance to work in this Union.</p>
