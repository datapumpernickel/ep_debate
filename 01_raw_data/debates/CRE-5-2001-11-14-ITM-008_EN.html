The purpose of my statement is to update you on the crisis and inform you of the initiatives that the Council has taken and will take further. I will therefore concentrate on the question of Afghanistan, which lies at the heart of the current crisis, after which I will also discuss the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Afghanistan, when the Council found itself faced with an emergency situation it reacted with determination and clarity. At its meetings of 21 September and 19 October, the European Council defined the framework of the European Union's action, which comprises two main elements. The first is solidarity with the United States and support for the actions taken as part of its legitimate defence and in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1368, on the understanding that these actions must be targeted and endeavour to spare the civilian population. The second is to contribute to the anti-terrorist coalition formed under the aegis of the United Nations. In late September, the troika visited Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt, where it had in fact met the Arab League leaders. Recently, it visited countries in Central Asia. The EU-Russia Summit of 3 October and the European Conference of 20 October were an opportunity to discuss the action to be taken at international level. The November meeting of the General Assembly will offer a further opportunity to reinforce this coalition.</p>
<p class="contents">In concrete terms, the European Union's strategy towards Afghanistan follows five broad lines: attaching priority to emergency humanitarian aid, the central role of the UN, the quest for a just and lasting internal political settlement, the importance of a reconstruction plan for the country and, lastly, the need to give the stabilisation plan a regional dimension. It should be noted that the General Affairs Council of 17 October in Luxembourg and the informal summit of 19 October in Ghent clearly approved these five strategy lines.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to emergency humanitarian aid, to date we have mobilised some EUR 320 million to deal with the crisis of the refugees and displaced people and with the effects of the famine. The main difficulty is access to the people in need, which requires full cooperation from Afghanistan's neighbouring states. The presidency has taken various steps to that end. With regard to the release and distribution of the aid, there is close cooperation between the Member States' cooperation agencies, ECHO and the various international humanitarian organisations, such as the HCR, the World Food Programme, the ICRC and the many NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second strategy line is the central role of the UN. The European Union recognises the United Nations as the sole body with the international legitimacy to seek an internal political solution. The United Nations will also have a determining role to play in the implementation of a reconstruction plan for the country. The European Union therefore supports the UN Secretary-General and his representative for Afghanistan in their efforts. It is also most interested in the plan that has just been submitted by Mr Brahimi, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative. The Council is coordinating its efforts with a view to deciding how best it can contribute to the implementation of this plan.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of an internal political settlement, the European Union believes it is important for the future Afghan authorities to be elected by the Afghans, for them to be representative of the ethnic groups on the ground and for them to respect and promote human rights, humanitarian rights and the rule of law in general; finally, they must refuse to cooperate in any way with terrorism and maintain harmonious relations with neighbouring states, thereby contributing to general stabilisation. For the time being, the European Union prefers not to openly advocate any one solution over another, leaving this to the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and to the Afghans themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the reconstruction plan, in the light of internal political developments in Afghanistan, the European Union believes it is urgently necessary to draw up a reconstruction plan for the country. It wishes to be involved, together with many other actors, including the donor countries and international organisations. It also believes that this will be a long-term undertaking that will require a long-term commitment by those participating in the plan.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to regional strategy, the European Union believes there can be no lasting peace in Afghanistan unless a regional approach is taken. In other words, Afghanistan's neighbours, together with certain other powers in the region, must be convinced that peace in Afghanistan will also be to their advantage. Legitimate account must also be taken of these states' security concerns, so as to avoid any further repetition of the foreign interference that has so often undermined Afghanistan and fuelled its internal conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union regards the following countries and international organisations as having an essential role to play in any regional strategy with regard to the Afghan question: Pakistan, Iran, India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, China, Russia and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we cannot discuss the latest developments. Events have speeded up over the last few days with the capture of Mazar-I-Sharif and Kabul. These events show that the Taliban regime and the terrorist networks are gradually losing control of Afghanistan. They represent another step towards achieving the international coalition's objectives, namely to root out the terrorist networks.</p>
<p class="contents">During these crucial hours for Afghanistan's future, Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the European Council, reiterated the Council's position yesterday, namely that there will be no stability in Afghanistan until a government can be established that is stable, legitimate, democratic and representative of all ethnic groups. This government will also have to adhere fully to the principles of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">He also pointed out that the United Nations must play a key role in helping the Afghans to form a government. The European Union intends to support the United Nations' plans to that end and strongly urges the Northern Alliance to contribute unreservedly to these efforts. Moreover, the EU is prepared to help Afghanistan draw up and implement a vast reconstruction plan, a vital guarantee of a return to peace. This project in no way affects the priority given to emergency humanitarian aid, which the Afghan people now need more urgently than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the President-in-Office of the European Council stressed the regional dimension of the Afghan issue. While the Afghans must, of course, themselves decide who will govern in the future, at the same time, all the other countries in the region will have to feel reassured by this new Afghan government. It is with this in mind that the President of the European Council, accompanied by the President of the Commission, will be visiting India and Pakistan on 23 and 24 November.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Middle East, the European Union continues to be deeply concerned by the situation there. The violence and lack of trust between the different parties have prevented a resumption of the political dialogue that should begin with the implementation of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell report recommendations and should conclude with a just and lasting solution to the conflict, based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principles set out in Madrid and Oslo.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of its strategy of relay diplomacy, the European Union, whether in the form of representatives of the Member States or of the Council, is always present on the ground. Thanks largely to the activities of Mr Solana, the High Representative, Mr Moratinos, the Special Envoy, and several European ministers, after many false starts, the Peres-Arafat meeting finally took place on 26 September. Unfortunately, the Israelis and the Palestinians did not succeed in this renewed attempt to call a ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euromed Conference held in Brussels on 5 and 6 November was an opportunity for a wide-ranging exchange of views on the question of the stability and security of the Mediterranean region. It allowed the participants, amongst other things, to take a further step towards resuming a high-level dialogue that could, eventually, restore the trust that would be needed before negotiations on the final status could resume.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the European Council and the President-in-Office of the Council will be heading for the Middle East again this week. They will be accompanied by the President of the Commission and by Mr Solana, the High Representative, whose important role is acknowledged by all the parties involved. This mission, which comes under the mandate the informal Council of Ghent entrusted to the Belgian Presidency, will offer an opportunity to remind the parties, once again, of the European Union's clear position on the goals the final negotiations must seek to achieve. These are, for the Palestinians, the constitution of a viable and democratic State and an end to the occupation of their territory; for the Israelis, the right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will also point out that the quest for a global and lasting peace in the region means taking due account of the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of the conflict, which must be resolved on the basis of the same principles.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, as you can see, up to this point the European Union has not stinted its efforts to seek a rapprochement between the various points of view in the Middle East and it will continue along this track for as long as is necessary. Furthermore, the European Union continues to keep a very close watch over the development of the situation in Afghanistan and throughout the Central Asian region. As a member of the anti-terrorist coalition, it will continue its action to combat all forms of support for international terrorism.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mrs Durant, ladies and gentlemen, as you know the situation in Afghanistan is changing very quickly. Every hour brings its fresh share of dramatic news. The military strategy against the Taliban has proved successful. Yet it is important to emphasise that despite the encouraging developments of recent days, the task is far from completed. The military campaign has not yet achieved all its objectives and we have always made it clear that we regard humanitarian and diplomatic issues as vitally important.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of what has happened, we will have to redouble our efforts in this regard. Moreover, even greater efforts will have to be made to establish a broad-based government for the Afghan people. As Mrs Durant emphasised, we strongly support the process conducted by the United Nations, under the aegis of Ambassador Brahimi. Furthermore, we must exploit the new military situation and intensify our humanitarian efforts. The Commission is playing an active role on both these fronts. Last week, Commissioner Patten met Mr Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, and this week he has held talks with Ambassador Brahimi in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will cooperate closely with the World Bank and the other parties involved with a view to evaluating the needs and contributing to the reconstruction work in Afghanistan. The Commission does not propose to speculate at this moment on the exact amounts of money involved. First of all the international community will have to assess urgent needs and, in consultation with the Afghan people, define exactly what is needed. Meanwhile, we are trying to ensure that the EUR 52 million in aid allocated under the ECHO programme for 2001 and the EUR 22.5 million earmarked in 2001 for displaced persons will indeed reach those who need it. In addition, thanks to the World Food Programme, we are now providing EUR 23.5 million in food aid, that is, about 36 300 tonnes, and we are granting the NGOs EUR 4.5 million for supplying the population with food, seeds and tools, that is, a total of EUR 100 million in aid this year. Furthermore, we have already decided, at the very least, to maintain these levels in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission has spared no effort since the events of 11 September. As you also know, in the space of a few days we presented new measures to combat terrorism in Europe and, in particular, proposed a common definition of acts of terrorism, a European arrest warrant to replace the cumbersome extradition system now in force between the Member States, more stringent rules on money laundering and, lastly, legislative provisions to ensure that the assets of an individual or an organisation can be quickly frozen throughout Europe as soon as they are identified as a potential source of finance for terrorism. Moreover, the Commission hastened to take measures to improve aviation security, ranging from access to the cockpit to luggage checks. At the same time, the European ministers jointly decided that the Member States should try to protect the airlines from the worst consequences of 11 September, for instance, by giving them insurance cover against acts of terrorism, something the commercial insurance companies were no longer offering, while avoiding a war of subsidies, which would distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also distributing massive humanitarian aid both within and outside Afghanistan. The Union and its Member States have already mobilised EUR 310 million to alleviate the sufferings of the Afghan people. This effort, which only the United States has surpassed, has largely gone unheeded, but it has already saved lives. Furthermore, the ECHO humanitarian aid office has been remarkably diligent in acting on its undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the aegis of President Romano Prodi, the Commission is also involved in crucial diplomatic efforts; Mrs Durant has already described Mr Prodi's itinerary over the coming days and weeks. This clearly shows that Europeans want to take a balanced, international diplomatic approach. As you know, in the days immediately after the attacks, Mr Chris Patten, accompanied by Mr Louis Michel, the Belgian Foreign Minister representing the Belgian Presidency of the EU Council, and Mr Solana, travelled to Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Wherever they went, the message they heard was the same: mankind as a whole must unite in the fight against terrorism. They discussed the need for closer cooperation within the region. The Union has already taken an important trade decision by improving the access of Pakistani exports to Europe and we hope we will soon be able to conclude a free-trade agreement with the six Gulf Cooperation Council states. Furthermore, we will be putting forward proposals on the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran. We will also play our full part in the efforts to relaunch the peace process in the Middle East, not only by giving financial support to the Palestinian Authority, which is beset by enormous difficulties, but also by trying to ensure the implementation of the Mitchell report that the European Union co-signed. As Mrs Durant pointed out, this week Mr Peres and Mr Arafat both attended the Euro-Mediterranean Conference held in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, the European Union is pursuing a common foreign policy, but this is not a single policy. Each country, each institution, draws on its own assets and pools its own resources for the sake of the common cause. The action the individual Member States decide to take underpins the common effort, and vice versa. The fact that the Member States take independent measures, especially in times of crisis, is not a sign of failure on the part of the Union. It illustrates the very nature of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me tell you, on behalf of the Commission, that we are all aware that the events of 11 September have changed the parameters and we have recognised that the attacks on New York and Washington were attacks not only on the United States but also on every free and open society. The threat is a common threat, which is why it needs a concerted response. The European Union, and the European Commission in particular, are making their full contribution to this common objective and we intend to continue along these lines.</p>

Thankfully, it was not an act of terrorism, although it was a truly horrific incident. However, Monday's fears show that terrorism is affecting our lives and that we cannot simply continue with ‘business as usual’. We must therefore make it clear that we regard terrorism as an enormous challenge, an intellectual, political, economic and, indeed, a military challenge. I welcome your comments, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. They tie in precisely with the keywords which I have written in my notes: we must dismantle the terrorist networks. This is the task now being undertaken in Afghanistan. We have all seen the pictures, which show the joy on people's faces in Kabul but also the dead bodies, obviously the victims of massacres. We therefore appeal to the Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmed Shah Massoud, a responsible leader whom we welcomed here in April, to conduct itself in Afghanistan and in Kabul in a way which demonstrates that it is a good representative, also for human dignity and a better future for this suffering country.</p>
<p class="contents">What we now need, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council on this point, is action from the United Nations. I welcome the fact that our American friends are involving the United Nations in this way. However, what we also need, and the European Union must play a key role here, is an alliance, a coalition for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. We must not repeat the mistake of the 1980s and 1990s, when we left Afghanistan to fend for itself. We must give Afghanistan our help.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's role throughout this conflict, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has been rather pathetic. Of course, the military issues are primarily national issues. We are not yet at the point where we, Europeans, can genuinely take on a joint role. However, I am extremely embarrassed by the conduct of some of the European Union countries over recent weeks. First of all, there was a tripartite meeting during the informal summit in Ghent, and then there was the meeting in London. I must say that I found this embarrassing. We do not have any self-appointed chiefs within the European Union; we have a European Union with a Council Presidency and a Commission. In London, the representatives, even the President-in-Office of the Council, invited themselves, and I found that especially embarrassing. Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and the Belgian Presidency attended the meeting in London; Greece, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark did not. I would have expected the Belgian Presidency, which I hold in high esteem, especially the Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, to protest about this meeting, as it should have been the presidency's task to invite Member States to a meeting of this kind instead of having to request an invitation to go to London. I hope that different procedures will be adopted in future and that this kind of division within the European Union will not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have to learn from our mistakes. I hope that we will learn from these mistakes as well. From our group's point of view, it is essential that we act jointly, not only at the level of intergovernmental cooperation. We want joint action from Europe, and we expect resolute and courageous action from the Council Presidency in this context too. We will support the Council Presidency if it responds in this way, and we will also support the Commission. Mr Busquin, I call upon the Commission, its President and all its members: please make Europe's voice heard! The Commission must get involved; it must state its opinion, and it must not simply accept what we have witnessed in recent weeks and months. We have a chance if we take this resolute stance, and I can say on behalf of our group that we will be resolute in our support for the Council Presidency and the Commission if the shared interests of the European Union are stated clearly. We call on you to take this action. If you do so, you can be sure of our support.</p>

And we need a common will: that of the coalition, whose framework or basis is the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The news over recent days confirms that hope is beginning to come to Afghanistan, and we must state one thing very clearly: the primary victims and hostages of the aggressive fundamentalism of terrorism have been the Afghans, and particularly, the Afghan women, because it is they who have suffered most from this situation. This is demonstrated by the television pictures we are seeing of women, and men, but particularly women, who can now move around with their faces exposed. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have the obligation, through the United Nations, to seek a political solution to the Afghan situation, firstly, and to the whole complex problem of Central Asia. The European Union must continue to cooperate in terms of humanitarian aid and cooperate with the UNHCR in order to deal with the problem of the refugees and displaced persons, and also so that, under the auspices of the United Nations, there is a plan for stability and future democracy in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must continue to intensify our action, so that the European Union can respond to terrorism. Police cooperation is improving. Just yesterday, eleven people from Bin Laden’s network in Spain were arrested in my country, and this is happening every day in other countries of the Union. In general, we are guaranteeing the rights of people who want to fight our democratic and pluralist system, and this is to our credit, but it causes problems. And in Parliament we are trying to move ahead quickly, together with the Commission, to create a common anti-terrorist policy. We must continue in that vein.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we note that we lack the capacity to act jointly in a military sense. Up to a point, we have compensated for that lack by means of other policies, but that does not justify this vacuum in the security and defence policy. Rather than looking back to see who was at the meeting in Ghent, or, bringing to mind that old film, ‘Guess who’s coming to dinner’, working out who was in London and who was not, what the European Parliament has to say to the Council and the Commission is that we want the security and defence policy to be included in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take this opportunity to say to the Commissioner that my group, and, I believe, the whole of Parliament, hopes that the Commission, using its powers as guardian of the Treaties, and also its powers of initiative, will take a clear approach in relation to Laeken and the Convention by raising these issues. We will support them in that and, in this way, we will be able to overcome the current situation: updating our security and defence policy, updating the Petersberg tasks and stating it jointly. That must be our response.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a final comment, Madam President, on an absolutely essential point which we were able to raise in the Euro-Mediterranean forum, which followed the forum held by the Council, where we were able to speak with our colleagues, parliamentarians from both sides of the Mediterranean. We heard voices – Arab, Israeli and European – agreeing that we have to continue working, and the European Union is playing a central role for the first time, in order to create an Israeli State with secure borders together with a Palestinian State which also has secure borders. This is the only possible basis for a stable solution in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in Parliament, must therefore decisively support the work of our representatives, both here and in the Middle East.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, the war in Afghanistan is clearly now producing military dividends, as has been seen in the past 48 hours in the extraordinary scale and speed of the collapse of the Taliban, although they still remain potentially very powerful in large parts of the country and the terrorists they have been succouring remain hidden from view.</p>
<p class="contents">However there are aspects of the war and not just the terrorist aspect which have been kept hidden and one group I should like to mention – to which, Madam President, you paid tribute on Monday – is the journalists who paid the ultimate price to tell us the story. We know so little about modern war and we are so excluded by the powers-that-be that without the commitment and professionalism of journalists we would know nothing. We need to reiterate that debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">What we know from the comparative success in Mazar-i-Sharif and now in Kabul, and even reports of the front line extending to Kandahar, is that new challenges are presenting themselves. The international coalition – particularly the United States and not least its President – has assumed that the Northern Alliance is in some ways biddable, that it will do certain things and not others. So we were told with some certainty that it would not take Kabul. But it is there. It seems to me that it is not quite so biddable as many in the coalition suggested or hoped. It makes all the more urgent the diplomatic initiative to generate respect for the rule of law and a stable governmental process, even if not yet a stable government. It becomes more urgent because new freedoms are emerging even as I speak, as we can see in the television pictures from Kabul. But we also hear of new fears, because Afghanistan has a brutal history and the brutality was not just the work of the Taliban. So there is a great need for urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge is the humanitarian one, which preceded the war but has been compounded by it. Now that there is a larger swathe of territory not subject to Taliban control, we must <span class="italic">visibly</span> and urgently assess what needs to be done and be present on the ground. Our support for the humanitarian effort needs to be translated into practical action. The Commissioner spoke of extraordinary amounts of money, which I think he said were largely unrecognised. Unfortunately Europe's contribution is often unremarked in these situations, and we have to have a visible presence on the ground and show our solidarity, not just in the military campaign but also in the humanitarian effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two final comments. One concerns the Middle East. I salute the quiet but effective diplomacy of Mr Solana and his colleagues, the Belgian Presidency, the Commission and others, because, while America has been looking in another direction, we have managed to de-escalate the worst of the tensions, a necessary prelude to the Mitchell process which is the path to a viable peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues have referred to the European security and defence policy. My group is strongly in favour of it and welcomed the moves in that direction. We thought that was what ESDP was, until we discovered recently at Downing Street that it is European security and dining policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I should like to hear your comments on the European security and dining policy, which runs counter to the concept of a European security and defence policy that is for all and not just for some.</p>

It is extremely difficult to question the military course of affairs because the situation is so extremely fluid. I should nevertheless like to ask one question in this connection, namely with regard to an element which, in my view, will remain high-priority for the foreseeable future. It concerns the idea of sending a UN peace-keeping force to Kabul to ensure that the situation there does not get out of hand. Has the Council discussed in any way or at any time the fact that European countries, or the Union perhaps as a whole, would make a contribution to the UN peace-keeping force, or does the Council hold the view that it would be best if this UN peace-keeping force were to comprise representatives from Muslim countries only? In other words, is future involvement by the EU provided for in this UN peace-keeping force?</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the humanitarian aspect. It is clear that there are still many needs and it is also evident that the invasion of large parts of Afghanistan by the Northern Alliance enhances the prospect of granting this aid. Does the Commission know whether at the moment, or over the next few days, all aid which the Commission wishes to grant is being delivered promptly and adequately, or are there still obstacles? If so, what are they?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to touch upon the political and diplomatic dimension. My group fears that the politicians will be trampled underfoot by the military. The fact of the matter is that the military conquests have preceded the political ones. My group is concerned that finding a political solution could be frustrated or perhaps even made impossible if the Northern Alliance continues to advance southwards. I know that the European Union and the EU Member States, alongside UN representative Mr Brahimi, are involved in finding what you refer to as a stable government. What is the EU’s specific involvement at the moment, and in the next few days, in finding this political solution which, in my view, takes priority over anything else? This might well be higher on the list of priorities than a military solution. If no political solution is found, any military invasion could well be in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a comment on London. I am not so much concerned about the fact that countries that make military contributions, and that want to discuss this, meet in London. What does worry me is the fact that the agenda of London also featured the Middle East policy. I would ask you, among others, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether Middle East policy is drafted in London or in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does us all good to read the sense of liberation on the faces of the Afghans and the rout of some of the most obscurantist and cruel oppressors the world has seen.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us however, without further ado, take a good look at all the aspects of the situation today, to make sure that our hopes are not soon overshadowed by a new nightmare.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the fighting is, alas, not yet at an end. The Taliban have regrouped in southern Afghanistan and near the border with Pakistan, where they will go to any lengths to try to save, at whatever price, the remnants of their power and capacity to inflict harm. It would be a disaster if they managed to gain support for their deadly cause from Pashtun groupings, who might feel rejected by the new leaders of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the various rival factions that make up the Northern Alliance, we must beware of idealising them. The way women are treated in some of the provinces under its control gives real cause for concern. Furthermore, its past conduct, only five years ago, and the disturbing information we have received from Mazar-i-Sharif unfortunately suggest that there is a risk that sooner or later they will embark on a bloody settling of scores in the reconquered territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience shows that what were once effective aids to military action can turn into serious obstacles to a political solution. From the outset, the political issue has been the determining factor.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must look at the distress of the Afghan people, exhausted by five years of terror, months of drought and misery, followed by five weeks of intensive bombing. The UN estimates that seven and a half million people are at risk of famine in this devastated country. In fact, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN Special Representative, has repeatedly called for a rapid end to the war for this very reason.</p>
<p class="contents">What the country does need, however, is emergency aid and development aid on a large scale. For let us not forget that international opinion was mobilised specifically in order to neutralise the terrorist networks, to cut off the sources, mainly financial, that feed them and also to destroy the social and political breeding ground on which they thrive. To date, we have certainly not achieved this just and ambitious aim and any failure to find a political solution to the Afghan problem would only take us further from attaining it.</p>
<p class="contents">This explains the role that an international player such as the European Union, and particularly the UN, must fulfil through its Member States, as well as within the framework of our relations with the American leaders and with the countries of the region. This will enable a political solution to be found that comes from all sectors of Afghan society and from Afghanis who, until now have been the chief victims of the Taliban, must now be among the agents of change. It is high time this martyred population was offered stability, dignity and peace.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a taboo which I, or rather we, intend to confront: women’s participation, the substantial participation of women in the provisional government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Secretary General hopes for an ethnically balanced transitional government. The Council, in the person of Mrs Durant, has told us she hopes for a fair and lasting composition. But what justice are we talking about? What balance are we talking about? Millions of Afghan women have not only been the primary victims but have also been the major architects of non-violent opposition all these years throughout the world. You know them: they are the women from Negar and RAWA; they have been here in the European Parliament; they were the ones who ran the country before the Taliban. They made up 40 per cent of the medical staff, 50 per cent of the teachers, 70 per cent of the administration, while the men were off making war. Yet around the negotiating table I only see men with beards, some longer, some shorter, but I have not seen any of those fantastic women we have met any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, I know very well that I will be greeted with smiles and grins everywhere. I know very well how I felt when faced by those smiles in ’97 and ’98, when this Parliament and the Commission were, to my knowledge, the only institutions that supported the campaign <span class="italic">‘A flower for the women of Kabul’</span> in 1997. This courage of ours – of yours, ladies and gentlemen – I believe should continue. Now, enough of the gossip, the discrimination, the exclamations of ‘women, poor things’! No, enough of that! We want Afghan women to take on conspicuous political responsibility in the reconstruction of their country in the transitional government.</p>
<p class="contents">I know this will not be enough; I know public opinion needs to be mobilised. Therefore on 24 November we are promoting a day of fasting throughout the world, a world satyagraha, precisely so that women can at last form a part of this provisional government.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope this proposal of ours will not be received with the usual derision. Often, those who concern themselves seriously with human rights have much greater vision, application and objectivity than those who always believe they know it all and think that the world today can go on simply with the traditional <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>. Things are not like that. The human side, people are the architects of their futures. What future can there be, however, without half of the population? Therefore: 24 November, world satyagraha day, so that women can form part of this provisional government.</p>

All that Massoud asked of the international community and the European Union was to exercise effective diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to stop it from interfering in any way in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan. He was counting on his awareness of the Afghan people's exasperation with the Taliban when he predicted that it would rebel, including in the largely Pashtun southern territories. He assured us that he had set up an Alliance network throughout the country that would guarantee the establishment of a broad-based government of national unity. The speed of events over the past 48 hours has surprised only those of our learned experts who, without ever having been on the ground, professed that the anti-Taliban Alliance was made up only of a bunch of warlords who were just as barbaric as the Taliban themselves, and even more dangerous because inspired only by a hunger for power that would inevitably trigger new quarrels among themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Echoing the anxiety shown in Islamabad, these same experts, totally certain they are right, are still spreading the word via the media that the Northern Alliance represents only a very small percentage of the opinion of the Afghan people, who are supposedly still attached to the peace that only the Taliban have managed to bring them. The jubilant popular demonstrations in Kabul, the rebellion now underway in Kandahar itself, the signs of the return of thousands of refugees suffice to show that these prophets of doom were misled. The Members of this Chamber who had the intelligence to listen to Massoud will certainly rejoice.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the situation remains politically fragile. It is up to the international community, and within it the European Union, to help establish this united government, which the former king, Zahir Shah, is willing to support.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we must also give the Afghan people all the material aid it needs to recover from a disastrous humanitarian situation, in which, as Mr Wurtz said, we fear for the survival of 1.5 million Afghans who are at risk of famine and for the health of more than 6 million who are now at risk of serious malnutrition. We hoped that the Council and the Commission would be prepared to give undertakings along these lines without delay. I thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for confirming this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The end of the Taliban dictatorship opens the door to a process of democratic reconstruction, which, however, is still far from a foregone conclusion. We will probably see Islamist guerrilla warfare on the Algerian model, against which massive bombing is pointless and will have to be halted.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must adopt a strong and clear stance for, as Mrs Emma Bonino and Mr Francis Wurtz said, Afghan women must not be sacrificed in the process of political reconstruction. The participation of women is the key to the lasting reconstruction of Afghanistan. They will have to be present as from the first negotiations and will have to participate in a new government as from the first day. That is the only solution that can guarantee the protection and respect for the rights of women and all human rights. The European Union could not endorse a proposed government that did not take account of this crucial dimension. The integration of women is also a first step towards democracy. Unfortunately, this democracy cannot accommodate warlords who have proved guilty of repeated human rights abuses, a wide range of acts of violence and who, whatever side they are on, are more concerned with defending their ethnic group than with the future of their country. We must put an end to the reign of impunity. The Afghans must be represented by a mixed, democratic government that represents all the ethnic groups and respects human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, recent events have demonstrated to the world that the military strategy being pursued by the American government in Afghanistan is working. The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan is a legitimate objective. The Taliban is harbouring Osama bin Laden, an international terrorist who has committed heinous acts of terror, not only this year, but in recent years too. Harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The fall of key strategic cities in Afghanistan this week will certainly help in the process of eroding the power of the Taliban. But much work remains to be done if the Taliban are to be defeated in the near future. They are a military force to be reckoned with and they have extensive military experience. I hope that the Taliban regime can be defeated and replaced by a broader alliance of political groupings in Afghanistan. This is not going to be an easy task, but it must be vigorously pursued as a military option.</p>
<p class="contents">Under UN Resolution 1373 it is incumbent on us all to ensure that those involved in perpetrating such vile acts of terrorism in America last September are brought to justice. We too must prevent further terrorist attacks, and this can only be achieved if the international community continues to work closely together.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue which clearly needs to be addressed in the context of the war in Afghanistan relates to the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people. The international community, under the auspices of the United Nations and through the European Union, must bring forward a visible and viable strategy to guarantee that humanitarian supplies are delivered to the Afghan people. A visible humanitarian strategy must be an absolute priority if the Afghan people are going to be able to live through a very cold winter. There must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need. This can only be carried out with the involvement of the international community and key non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In time the United Nations and the European Union should be given positive roles as new political structures develop in Afghanistan. We must all play our part in guaranteeing that international terrorism is defeated. Clearly, a multi-faceted approach is needed if we are to guarantee that the roots of international terrorism are tackled head-on.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is very important that we reiterate the message that the war against terrorism is not a battle against Islam. There are millions of Muslims living within the Union who are fully integrated within our societies and who contribute positively to the development of the European Union. The European Union as a political entity is a friend, and will always be a friend, to the Muslim people. We must reaffirm this message at every opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it has been shown that the strategy pursued in Afghanistan by the coalition against terrorism is the right one. It has also been shown that this is not merely a matter of hunting down terrorists, but also liberating a nation from a government which is far from popular among its own people. This has been shown quite clearly, and I think we should say so in all frankness in order to make it clear in this way that we have nothing against an Islamic people; on the contrary, we want to work with it to build a future in freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this also means, and this is borne out by Afghanistan's history, that we should work together with its own government and respect its decisions, and that it is not our task to involve ourselves in the details. I think this is also extremely important if the task of creating a government of reconciliation in Afghanistan is to be mastered successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, the European Union must take an active role with its conflict prevention and civilian crisis management capacities and help organise the reconstruction of the country on this basis, as long as this is what the parties involved want.</p>
<p class="contents">In more general terms, the events of recent weeks have shown that in the areas where the European Union functions effectively, it can make a significant contribution. I do not believe that the coalition against terrorism would have operated as effectively in the Middle East without the European Union and the visits by its troika.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must acknowledge that in the military field, where we are particularly weak, we have continued to rely heavily on bilateralism and directed solutions. I think it is clear that in all areas of security and defence policy, we must move more resolutely towards a community approach. It must become clear that even the larger Member States, which think they still have a role to play, actually had no influence on all the strategies which have been enforced. We must therefore accept that we will only have a role to play if we act jointly, if we achieve our common goal of establishing a 60 000-strong rapid deployment force by 2003, and if we underpin our conflict prevention and crisis management capacities credibly with this third component.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that this must, to a substantial extent, be discussed in the light of Laeken and in the context of the post-Nice process. Time and again, when we are active in the foreign policy field, we see the extent to which our inadequate structures prevent us from bringing our full weight to bear. I am thinking in particular of the frequent organisational chaos in the Balkans and the competition not only between Solana and Patten but also between the parallel structures which were established and which, as experience has shown, work against and not with each other. These structures must be rationalised, perhaps in the hands of the Commission with their own legitimation via the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, these are the lessons we have learned from the last two months, and we should call on the governments in our countries to respond appropriately. I believe it is necessary, in the interests of the future viability of our nations, to cultivate this community method to a greater extent in future in the field of foreign and security policy too.</p>

Since Mr McMillan-Scott is not here, we could possibly steal half a minute of his time.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to say that, unfortunately, the objective of the fight against international terrorism has not been achieved with the fall of Kabul nor will it be by a possible fall of Kandahar soon. We must, of course, focus on many other criteria. Of major importance are, naturally, the tracking down of terrorist cells in, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, Europe, the freezing of financial sources of international terrorism and the whole discussion, also in our society, around the question as to what groups are, in fact, active in our society and how we can call a halt to their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, a large number of conditions must also be created in Afghanistan in order to be able to remove this kind of breeding ground for international terrorism. A multi-ethnic government is logical, but we must also manage to find a special solution for Kabul, of course. Peace must be established with the countries around Afghanistan to ensure that an area of stability and peace is created. The refugees must be able to return home and a massive amount of money must be invested in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Finally, we must ensure that a government is put in place that respects human rights. That is a total package.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes can be found indirectly in the Middle East. Although that is not the case, that argument <span class="italic">is</span> being used by Bin Laden. I therefore believe that the Middle East peace process needs an extra boost and I also wonder whether the time has come to do this now. I would direct this question to the President-in-Office of the Council, if she happens to be listening. I would especially ask you whether you, together with the Commission, could not ensure that a UN resolution on a Palestinian state could now be laid down at long last? Has the time not come for pushing for breakthroughs on this score, as we did years ago with Israel? I also wonder whether an evaluation is not needed of the role of Saudi-Arabia in the funding of all possible institutions in western Europe which one would be right to question? The position of Syria has already been mentioned. As our President has already pointed out, I also believe it is useful and necessary to help the young Assad to play the far more positive role which we had all expected of him, but which, through all kinds of circumstances, he was unable to fulfil. As, however, Syria plays a crucial role, a great deal more needs to be done there.</p>
<p class="contents">If we as the EU want to play a part, also in the peace process as a whole, we must be careful what action we undertake, for example, in connection with the arms sales or the supply of goods for dual use to Iran. Israel is monitoring the proceedings with great concern, and I believe that these kinds of signals are of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, nearly everyone has already said it, and I am not about to repeat it, but it is unacceptable for the European Union to continue to send out a disintegrated picture. We must show a united front and act at Community level in terms of external, peace and security policy. If we still fail to get the message, how can we then expect to play a role on the world stage? I therefore make a dramatic appeal, also to the presidency, to make huge strides forward on this score. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I know that Europe has two obligations towards Afghanistan. Together with the UN, we must press for a political settlement of the conflict, aimed, as Guy Verhofstadt said, at the establishment of a stable, legitimate and democratic government that is very broadly representative of all the ethnic groups and abides by the principles of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I believe we also have a second duty towards Afghanistan, an urgent duty. We know that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is a tragedy. It is the result of the combined effect of a war that has been devastating this country for 23 years and the drought that has plagued it for the past three years. We know that seven million people were dependent on humanitarian aid even before the military operations began. We also know that up to 100 000 children may die this winter unless adequate supplies reach them in the coming weeks. That is why we call on Europe to take urgent, large-scale measures in face of this humanitarian tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of what we hope will become a process of permanent consultation between the European Union, the United States, Afghanistan's neighbouring states, the specialist UN agencies and the NGOs working in Afghanistan, we call, as you, Madam President, have also done on several occasions, for the creation of safe humanitarian corridors through which emergency food aid and shelter for the displaced Afghans can be brought in. This is not only an urgent requirement; it is quite simply the duty of the peoples of the European Union, whom we represent here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Durant,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, I will reply or, at least, try to give some kind of reply to the comments made during this debate, which is all the more interesting because it is being held at a moment when we have very high hopes while at the same time having little idea of what the outcome will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first take you back to the famous meeting in London that several of you mentioned and remind you that this meeting was certainly not arranged at the presidency's initiative. The presidency is responsible for inviting and chairing the meetings of the Fifteen. The Ghent meeting, by contrast, was convened for military reasons or, in other words, those who wished to meet in Ghent cited military reasons. In regard to the London meeting, let me also point out that the presidency was invited to that meeting but as I said, the meeting was not held at its initiative. Once he had been invited, Mr Verhofstadt, the President of the European Council, naturally contacted his various colleagues immediately to ascertain their individual positions. He was strongly encouraged to go to London and at the COREPER meeting the following day, he immediately undertook to report back on everything that would be said in London and chose to be accompanied by Mr Solana, since he felt that these issues were indeed most important and related to security.</p>
<p class="contents">So these are a few facts about the context of this meeting in London. Allow me to repeat that the European Union obviously plays a diplomatic and political role but also a humanitarian one – and I am saying this not just by the way but as a definite statement. I declared in my introductory statement, as Mr Busquin also declared on behalf of the Commission, that we attach great importance to humanitarian questions, not only at the level of words or financial resources, but also and above all at the level of deeds. We are making sure that we take action here. You may be certain that the presidency of the Council and the Commission are determined to make very concrete, specific and urgent progress in terms of responding to the situation and endeavouring to do so very visibly. It is indeed important, over and above the action to be taken, for people to know and see that the European Union wants to play and will play a role in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Poettering that Europe must speak with one voice. I can assure you that the Presidency of the Council has done its utmost to ensure this, in particular at the London meeting. It was a meeting we did not convene but prior to which the presidency was asked to consult the other Member States and to attend together with Mr Solana.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I have to say on London, Ghent and these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Lagendijk's question about, amongst other things, the United Nations force and the post-Taliban regime, the Council has not yet discussed the participation of the European Union as such in a United Nations force and has not, therefore, determined its position at this stage. Therefore I cannot give it. Conversely, regarding the stabilisation of the post-Taliban regime, I think that will necessarily require consultation with the countries of the region under the aegis of the United Nations and therefore of the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are discussing this post-Taliban regime, which we all hope will be stable, multi-ethnic and democratic, while also knowing that the road will be a difficult one, let me put particular emphasis on a question which I and the Presidency of the Council feel very strongly about, namely the gender question. We must indeed aim at a representation and a government that are more democratic, stable, etc. But we must also take the gender question into consideration. Neither I nor the Presidency of the Council would find it comprehensible if Afghan women, who were the first victims of the Taliban regime and who suffered a great many deprivations, especially of their rights, while taking on huge responsibilities, were excluded from the formation of this government and its future activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think nearly all the speakers pointed out that we very much need to adopt a more integrated European stance on common security. We need to act as a community. The Belgian Presidency is convinced of this and I really hope this question will be on the agenda of the Laeken Summit. Recent events have made it abundantly clear that we have to move forward together, in a more harmonious manner and as a community.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the replies I wanted to make to this debate, which, I believe, has highlighted some extremely useful and important principles for the days, weeks and months ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Durant pointed out, the question of humanitarian aid is of course paramount. As many speakers have also shown, it is a priority at a time when winter is approaching and the people are in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only confirm our resolve to release the funds that have been allocated. Let me repeat that the amount for 2001 is EUR 100 million, channelled via the World Food Organisation and the non-governmental organisations. This being said, if we agree about the creation of safety corridors, I think it is then up to us to ensure, via the ECHO instrument, that the aid is delivered as effectively as possible. That, at least, is the Commission's resolve. I can only confirm it.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission, in consultation with the international community and the Afghan people, including, of course, Afghan women, is assessing the reconstruction needs, as indeed it also did in Serbia, where that process was regarded as a model of speed and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, at diplomatic level, Mr Prodi and Mr Patten, in particular, are quite ready to respond to the requests the Presidency of the European Union will no doubt be making to them in the next few days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
