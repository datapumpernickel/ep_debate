<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rothley (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I must, and can, be brief. This week we are able, for the first time, to adopt a European Union legislative act which has been drawn up on the initiative of the European Parliament and on which, thank God, the Commission and the Council have cooperated positively. It is about improved protection for accident victims in the European Union. This directive resolves a large number of the problems which usually arise when people are involved in an accident in another country.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, however, and before looking back, I wish to take a look into the future. Commissioner Bolkestein, a draft fifth directive already exists. I have drawn it up and it will soon be put before Parliament. I very much hope that we will also be able to cooperate closely on this issue. The fifth directive is therefore already in the pipeline. At the beginning of June – this is also part of our glance into the future – we will be holding a conference at the Academy of European Law in Trier on another important issue, the reform of personal injury, and this may give rise to a further parliamentary initiative. As you can see, we wish this debate on improved protection for accident victims to gain a certain momentum. I would be very grateful to you in particular, Commissioner, if we could achieve this together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be grateful to you because you made an important contribution – and this is where I start to look back – to the debate on the fourth directive. You see there was the major problem of deciding whether this directive ought to apply when the accident had taken place in a Member State of the European Union. I have never understood why the Commission initially fought against this so stubbornly; its stance could not be justified from a logical, political or legal point of view. Then, thankfully, when we discussed this in Parliament at the end of last year, you prepared the ground for us to make this possible. This directive will now apply in all countries which are members of the green card system, meaning that approximately 90% of all accidents in which Europeans might be involved will be covered. And while I am on the subject of figures, we are talking about approximately 500 000 accidents a year in the European Union alone – not counting third countries – where we will be able to settle claims much more easily in the future. In the past there was the problem that people had to cope with a foreign language, foreign laws and so on. Sometimes the process dragged on for ages. When I look at the petitions which have been sent to the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions because claims arising from traffic accidents in another country have taken years and years to settle, I am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very decisive step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we cannot in any way change either the law which has to be applied or the legal jurisdiction, but by now proposing a system whereby each insurer has a claims representative in every other country, we will probably be able, as far as the accident victim is concerned, satisfactorily to settle the claims arising from 90% of all traffic accidents which take place in another country. That is a very big step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">When we debated this, some questions were still open. I did, and I would just mention this point, rather regret the fact that the compensation bodies – and these were, after all, the Commission’s idea – were gradually watered down during the political consultation process. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, we did find a solution which is satisfactory, but in three to four years’ time we will review what this directive has achieved and, if necessary, propose improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say that thanks to your intervening, Commissioner, important progress has been made on this directive, and I should specifically like to thank you for that. You overcame resistance from within your own Commission. This was a great achievement and we thank you very much for it. I hope that, where the protection of accident victims and its improvement is concerned, we will also enjoy fruitful cooperation in the future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bigliardo (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Rothley for his work, for this measure will put an end to a series of worrying and embarrassing situations which have arisen in our Community. The joint draft adopted by the Conciliation Committee certainly represents great progress for our Community. Nevertheless, although I will vote for the motion, I have to say that I am very perplexed by the response I have received from the Commission to my question on an issue which is not completely related to the question of accidents which take place abroad but which nevertheless concerns the insurance sector, a sector in which, as far as I am concerned, in Italy, truly unimaginable events occur, which leads me to suspect that Parliament’s inspection system is, indeed, defunct. </p>
<p class="contents">I tabled a question to the Commission, calling upon them to do something about the genuinely appalling issue of those insurance companies which set high premiums and then do not pay citizens from certain parts of the Community what they are entitled to. A conference, sponsored by the 'Automobile Club d’Italia', was held in Naples and attended by leading lawyers, because insurance companies, as was also the case in the past, are making Italian citizens pay different premiums according to where they live, claiming that they have to recoup their costs in the areas where there are a greater number of accidents. So I wonder, and I put the question to Parliament, whether this could be an example of blatant discrimination among the citizens of a single State and among citizens of the European Community. Although it is true that in certain areas a decidedly larger number of accidents is recorded, it is also true that, when people belong to the same state and the same Community, events are shared by citizens who live in the same district, the same area, the same country and the same Community. With regard to the payment of premiums, absolutely incredible, unbelievable things happen: in a town such as Alexandria, for example, premiums are less than half the level of those in a town such as Naples or Catania. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I feel that, like Parliament, in addition to developing this type of measure, such as that presented in the Rothley report, we should endeavour to take further steps to avoid blatant discrimination against citizens of the same country, and also extend an invitation to the insurance companies: while it is mandatory to be insured, it is also mandatory for the insurance companies to insure the citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">In certain regions of Italy, the fact is that insurance companies refuse to insure the Italian citizens, which is an extremely serious offence. In this regard, I would like to repeat the question I tabled, to which the Commission replied that the European Parliament has no competence in this sector. Nevertheless, although we are competent when it comes to regulating the matter, as the Rothley report is doing in relations between the different Member States, I feel that we ought to challenge the insurance companies to avoid blatant discrimination, to set the same premiums for all, to pay claimants what they are actually entitled to and to ensure that this sector is improved, or adapted in some way to the changing requirements of our society. </p>
<p class="contents">In making these statements, I would like to declare that I particularly support this report and, once again, I thank Mr Rothley and the Commission for their endeavours on behalf of our citizens. I urge them to take action to resolve this matter as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Rothley was extremely kind in thanking the Commission for what it has done. The Commission has perhaps been constructive in the formulation of this fourth motor insurance directive. However, as Mr Rothley said, it was in response to an initiative from the European Parliament. The Commission is duly thankful to him for that initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say that the Commission welcomes the adoption of this fourth motor insurance directive by Parliament. As Mr Rothley pointed out, every year there are more than 500 000 car accidents involving vehicles from different Member States. However, the current system of compensation for people involved in an accident outside their home country does not work satisfactorily. The new directive will provide for improved information, easier procedures and quicker settlement of claims, and these are things which concern the citizens of all our Member States most directly. This is also a measure which will bring the European Union closer to the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have just said, the Commission's proposal was a response to a parliamentary resolution in which Parliament made use of its new powers under Article 192 of the Treaty on European Union. I should again like to thank Parliament explicitly and, of course, Mr Rothley, but also the competent committee and its chairperson, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, for the constructive discussions in the first and second readings of the directive and the subsequent negotiations in the course of informal trialogues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rothley has announced a fifth directive. He said that there will shortly be a conference in Trier on that directive and he has asked the Commission to help steer it through its legislative process. Perhaps it is a bit early to discuss the fifth directive now but I should like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Rothley that in any further legislative work in which this Parliament would like to engage, the Commission will take the same constructive attitude as it took with the fourth directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Bigliardo draws attention to the fact that the premia for motor vehicle insurance in Italy vary from region to region, according to the number of accidents. He objects to that differentiation in premia according to the frequency of accidents in the various parts of Italy and he would like the Commission to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell Mr Bigliardo that this is a matter which does not concern this directive. Strictly speaking, I could end my response there but his comments deserve a fuller answer. Therefore, I should like to say that if the situation had been that motor insurance premia were different for Italian citizens as compared with French or German citizens living in Italy, the Commission would be able to object. You cannot ask French or German citizens living in Italy to pay a different premium from Italian citizens. That is a clear case of discrimination. But that is not the case. The premia differ according to the number of accidents in each region and are therefore the same for Italians and non-Italians. They relate to the different areas of Italy. I do not think that the Commission can intervene on that point. It is a matter of how insurance companies calculate their premia, and if there are objective reasons for charging a higher premium for a particular region then the Commission is powerless. If Mr Bigliardo would like to substantiate his claim in more detail, I should be pleased to receive his letter and answer it. But if he would like a straightforward answer now, then it has to be that the Commission cannot intervene.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
