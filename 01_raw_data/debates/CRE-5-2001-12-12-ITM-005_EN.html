<p class="contents">I am pleased to announce that the Council has kept to this deadline. It took the decision to modify its own internal regulations on 29 November this year. This decision was published in the <span class="italic">Official Journal</span> of 30 November and came into force on 3 December, that is to say the same day when the regulation I referred to came into effect. It brings the provisions of the internal acts of the Council on access to documents together into a single instrument. It also contains new provisions on the implementation of the regulation. In accordance with Article 2 of the decision, certain other acts have been repealed. These are as follows. Firstly, the Council decision of 20 December 1993 on public access to Council documents, last modified by a decision of 14 August 2000. Secondly, a Council decision of 6 December 1999 concerning improving information on Council work and the public register of Council documents. Lastly, the Council decision of 9 April this year on the public communication of certain categories of Council documents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process concerning the right to access to documents that started with the Treaty of Amsterdam is being cast in a legal framework in this way. However, a number of further provisions still need to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions amongst the institutions about the establishment of an interinstitutional committee that will examine what the best practices are, handle any disputes and discuss future developments relating to public access to documents in accordance with Article 15 of the regulation, are still ongoing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is of the opinion that this committee must be put together at the level of the secretaries-general of the three institutions concerned, and it must be able to submit questions of a general or political nature or relating to matters of principle to the chairmen of the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the recent informal political trialogue between the Presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 28 November, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, formulated an interesting proposal as a solution to the problem of the level of representation within this interinstitutional committee. Her proposal was to allow this committee to meet at secretary-general level by way of an authorisation – <span class="italic">par délégation</span> in French – from their political bosses. I find this concept very interesting, and I told my fellow Presidents of Parliament and the Commission at the time that I would put this idea to the Council bodies for evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">May I just explain what it is about, because this discussion between the Council and Parliament on the matter of the level at which discussions should take place seems rather parochial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is worried that the presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission would have to act as a kind of appeal court, as it were, if it were to be decided at Secretary-General level that access to a document cannot be granted. We believe that this is not the kind of role that these presidents should play. They must not become a kind of appeal court; on the contrary, they must focus on broad issues, general questions, principles and the like. And that is what concerns us. It is not about the fact that the Council does not want this interinstitutional committee; it is about making sure that we do not create a court of appeal that is approached quasi-systematically, because we do not think that that will be to anyone’s benefit. There are other bodies that can be enlisted for this purpose, and this is therefore at the heart of the discussion. I thought that the suggestion by Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, offered a way out. For if the secretaries-general of the three institutions meet on the basis of an authority from their presidents, they will then have a mandate and in specific cases will then have to take decisions themselves concerning access to a document.</p>
<p class="contents">I am telling you this to clearly explain where the problem lies as far as the Council is concerned. I hope that my fellow Council members will also find Mrs de Palacio’s procedure positive and that we will be able to solve the problem in this way and get the interinstitutional committee off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Regulation gives 3 June 2002 as the last date by which the document registers must be operational.</p>
<p class="contents">How far have we got in this regard? As you know, the Council’s document register has been available to the public since 1 January 1999. This register contains all the documents that have been put before the Council or the preparatory bodies and which either serve as the basis for consultations, or have a definite influence on the decision-making process, or give an indication of the situation in certain files.</p>
<p class="contents">In November of this year, this register contained references to more than 250 000 Council documents in all our official languages, and it provides access to the contents of more than 50 000 documents. The register therefore seems to be an effective and reliable instrument with which the institutions’ documents can be identified and queried. Since the register has been operational, there has understandably been a significant increase in the demand for documents, most of which have in fact been available in the register. The number of consultations of the register is continuing to increase. In 1999, more than 70 000 hits resulting in about 600 000 requests were registered – and by this we mean screens consulted or clicked on. In 2000 the number of hits and requests increased to 160 000 and 1 260 000 respectively. This trend is continuing, and we have already had 130 000 visits and more than 1 million screens consulted in the first six months of 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In accordance with Article 9(7) of the regulation, the Commission and the Council must inform Parliament of sensitive documents. In this regard, the Council remains ready to conclude negotiations with Parliament on an inter-institutional agreement on common security and defence policy. This could be followed by other agreements, particularly on justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given this situation, Parliament should re-examine its position on its application to annul the Council security regulation. It should also adopt measures on the protection of documents classified as sensitive, in compliance with its own Rules of Procedure as recently modified. This would provide some assurance that these sensitive documents would be kept confidential within Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This brought to an end some quite considerable work by Mrs Maij-Weggen, and also, if I may say so, by Mr Cashman.</p>
<p class="contents">A week ago, and a few days after the Council, the Commission adopted a decision amending its own Rules of Procedure. Prior to this, on 28 November, we held a discussion to ensure the regulation is applied with the greatest transparency. It is true that we needed a few extra days for this. This is why the definitive decision of the Commission was only taken on 5 December. This prompted a number of questions, and your President raised the issue with us. I would like to reassure you in no uncertain terms that, in practice, these few days of delay had no repercussions for citizens. The Commission has in fact been implementing the regulation of 30 May since 3 December. Accordingly, we have a central point of access to the Secretariat-General of the Commission. We have a postal address, an e-mail address and a fax number available for people to use. It is also possible to consult the Commission’s website. In addition, there is the new access guide produced by ourselves, which you have discussed, Minister. This will be available on the website from next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, as far as we are concerned, all the practical measures necessary for the implementation of the regulation are in place. In fact, the Commission services have already started processing applications to access the new database established in accordance with the regulation. Article 18 of the regulation provides not only for the amendment of the Rules of Procedure, but also for the amendment of other existing provisions. Therefore, the appropriate services of the Commission have checked whether the 1983 regulation on opening historical archives to the public was in accordance with the regulation on access to documents. Some changes were needed. The Commission will shortly put to the Council and Parliament a proposal to change the regulation on historical archives.</p>
<p class="contents">The third consideration also concerns Article 18 of the regulation of 30 May. The Commission’s services have drawn up a list of the rules which are to be found throughout Community law which concern access to documents or information within existing Community legislation. This work has allowed us to identify almost fifty provisions that the Commission will examine in the light of the new regulation. All provisions that do not comply with the new rules on access to documents will either be modified or repealed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point I wanted to make today concerns how the regulation can be applied to agencies. Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, I understand that this is one of your concerns, which you have rightly raised. The matter is included in the joint declaration adopted along with the regulation. Work is under way on this issue too. Since adopting the new regulation, the Commission has provided the agencies with information on it and had invited them to re-examine their own rules on access in the light of the regulation. The existing instruments of incorporation of the agencies will be modified. An additional clause will be included in the instruments of incorporation of new agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s services have drawn up a guide to inform citizens of their rights under the regulation. In the first instance, this guide will be available on the Commission’s website in a few days’ time. However, in the near future, we plan to develop a common citizens’ guide on all three institutions. I hope this will happen soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have outlined all the work that the Commission has undertaken to implement this regulation on access to documents. This work will of course be followed up by an interinstitutional committee. The committee will be set up shortly and will establish a firm foundation for our cooperation in implementing this new regulation. Minister, I was pleased to hear you refer to the compromise proposal made by my colleague Mrs Loyola de Palacio on 28 November in the three-way discussion. She put it forward because a solution has to be found. I would like to thank you Minister for having noted that Mrs de Palacio put forward this compromise proposal with due regard for Parliament’s concern that political authority should play its full part in the interinstitutional committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to apply the regulation, each institution has worked independently to modify their own Rules of Procedure when they judged it appropriate. For its part, the Commission will continue to respect this independence. The Commission hopes to respect the spirit and the letter of this new regulation, which, we believe, represents a real step forward in terms of transparency and democracy within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was agreed at the time that the practical implementation had to be ready by 3 December, and that applied to all three institutions – the Council, the Commission and Parliament. The registers were to be ready by 3 June 2002, and today is 12 December. Where are we now, one week on from 3 December? Parliament approved its revised Rules of Procedure on 13 November, and Parliament’s Bureau saw to its implementation on 28 November. So as far as we are concerned, everything is in order. However, as Parliament we feel partly responsible for what the Commission and the Council do, and that is why we have opened this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First the Council: the Council adapted its Rules of Procedure to the regulation on 29 November and published them on 3 December – just in time, in other words. Two comments: firstly an earlier comment about the Solana decisions. It is not entirely clear from the Rules of Procedure whether or not the Solana decisions have been overruled by the regulation. Can Mrs Neyts please once again give us a very clear answer on this? And then a comment about Article 12, Paragraph 5, of the Council Decision, which states that notes, letters and suchlike relating to legislation and addressed to the Coreper, for example, are indeed covered by the regulation. However, Article 6 states that if Member States make comments about European legislation with regard to the Council or the Coreper in individual notes or letters, these do not have to be published. It seems to me that this is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, letters from a municipality to the national government always have to be published, and it seems to me that this should also be the case for Member States in respect of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">And then the Commission; the Commission implemented an amendment to the Rules of Procedure on 28 November and approved it on 5 December. Now, I am not quibbling over the two days’ delay, but I do have a few comments to make. The first is that the Commission has decentralised the implementation of the regulation. Is that wise? However, I have now heard Mr Barnier say that there will be one PO box and one e-mail address after all. So why is that not spelled out clearly in the Rules of Procedure? I cannot find it. My second comment is about the following problem: why hasn’t the Commission produced a clear definition of the term ‘document’, as Parliament and the Council have done? My third point is Article 8 of the Commission Decision. Why is it so vague about the author of the document? Is his name not allowed to be known if he is an official? After all, he puts his signature to it in this position, so I believe that this should fall under openness.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also not entirely clear what will happen with the agencies. The Commissioner has said something about that, but has the Commission initiated anything in this area? And then the security rules. Nothing has been published about these either. Why have the Council’s security rules been published and not the Commission’s? And now to my last comment, and I would like to pick up on Mrs Neyts’ point. I do not know whether it is wise to have an interinstitutional committee on a non-political level. Do you have to do this on an official level? I am very hesitant about that. I think that more consultation is needed on this point; at least we have stated in our Rules of Procedure that one of our Vice-Presidents would have to be responsible for it and Parliament would have to back this pronouncement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cashman (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first of all let me remind both the Council and Commission that the purpose of the regulation is: "to give the fullest possible effect to the right of public access to documents and to lay down the general principles and limits on such access". When looking at the Council and Commission decisions, I see an attempt to rewrite the regulation, in particular references to it in Article 9 of the Commission decision – documents which do not reflect opinions or individual opinions will not be made available. The same applies to Article 11 of the Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind both the Council and Commission that a restriction on access to documents can only refer to the exemptions listed in Article 4 and Article 9, which in turn relate back to Article 4. Equally, in the Commission's proposals, third country nationals are denied the right of complaint to the European Ombudsman – again, a violation of the spirit of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Under delegated powers the Commission believes it will not make legislative papers available until adoption of the final text. I would remind the House and the Commission that 90% of some 5 000 legislative acts adopted every year in the Union are under delegated powers. The Council has widened access to some of its internal documents, but maintains confidentiality on Member State demands on national delegations and national positions. Why is it that six months after the regulation entered into force, no information campaign has been launched by the institutions? Why? When are we going to have the Commission's proposals on amending secondary legislation? Has the Commission adopted security rules? If so, can it publish them according to the regulations? When will Parliament adopt its own security rules? I am extremely worried that if someone were now to approach and gain access via either the Commission's decision or the Council's decision we would see a violation of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to echo Mrs Maij-Weggen's very important point. It is not acceptable that we should have secretaries-general representing politicians in this interinstitutional committee. Politicians must be accountable and responsible for their decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I would like to ask that this committee for interinstitutional cooperation finally be established, in order that genuine transparency can be brought into effect as required by this Regulation. I also share the view of Mr Cashman that Parliament cannot approve the secretaries-general carrying on discussions of these matters in the name of the politicians, since transparency is, as a basic question of democracy, a highly political matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we must also look at what will be our future challenges once (hopefully) all these open questions with regard to this Regulation are resolved. This has been an important first step, but we still have lots of new challenges. I would like to mention some of these.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, what threatens to become an even larger problem is the matter which Mr Watson, Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, mentioned in a seminar yesterday: this anti-terrorist activity and the questions of the third pillar are leading towards an intolerable situation, since the Council continues to enact these anti-terrorism laws behind tightly closed doors, and the Parliament has virtually zero influence in these matters. In my opinion we must meet this challenge; questions of the third pillar must be properly brought within the sphere of public access to documents. Otherwise, there will be no democratic responsibility of any kind as far as these matters are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to mention a problem which relates to the protection of personal data. In my view we have a genuine problem here as well. Certainly we must protect personal data, but we cannot approve a situation where (for example) the names and personal details of representatives of industry who are taking part in Commission negotiations can be kept secret in the name of data protection. No, this idea is erroneous; and in these matters we must be careful to operate on the side of transparency, and so we certainly have our work cut out for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, we are unable to obtain what ought to be available to elected representatives in all parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 December, the regulation on public access to documents came into force. We were right there with a renewed request to scrutinise the documentation, but the officials discovered that there was nothing to be made available on the basis of the new rules, either. We have asked for a complete list of committees and working parties and the members of these. We have asked for details of the enlargement negotiations and to see the declarations and statements associated with current laws. When we debated the regulation on public access to documents, Parliament’s rapporteurs expected us to be able to obtain that type of information in the future. I should therefore like to ask our rapporteurs if they will be involved in taking proceedings against the Commission if our renewed request for access to documents also fails in the end to produce a satisfactory answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, most people say they believe in open and transparent government. I am quite sure the Commission and the Council are genuine in what they say. I congratulate them on the progress made so far but none of us should deceive ourselves into thinking that we do not need a lot more work before Europe is truly open and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to use my time to cite just one example – a petition to the European Parliament from various names at Lloyds of London. The petition claims that the United Kingdom Government has not properly applied the EU insurance directives. As a result of the petition the Commission very properly submitted, over a year ago, questions to the United Kingdom Government. That is when secrecy and cover-up begin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has allowed members of the Committee on Petitions – but only members – to see the actual questionnaire, and then only under extremely stringent conditions. Why not reveal the questions to the public, why not to the petitioners? The Commission would show it is doing its job. As for the answers, they are top secret. Nobody is allowed to know them – neither the Members of Parliament nor the petitioners – nobody. The UK Government says it is an informal communication and that it does not reveal informal communications. The Commission says that under the Framework Agreement it is not allowed to reveal the answers because there may be legal proceedings. The British Government does not have a leg to stand on. If this is not a formal communication, I would like to know what is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may have some argument, but I would remind the Commissioner of the Zwartveld judgement. In 1990 the Commission refused access to documents because it claimed there might be legal proceedings. The ECJ insisted that the documents were presented.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would say to the Commissioner this afternoon – you have made some progress but I can give you this example to show that a great deal of progress is still needed in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had a nice compromise, the best result we could have achieved this spring, a reasonable improvement on the Commission’s original proposals and the existing Rules of Procedure. We have essentially brought together the best practices of our Member States to form a new European standard. What we now have to do is to implement it, of course, and we must do all we can to really make it a success. As the European Parliament, we naturally want to keep a very close eye on how this will be done in practice, and my colleagues Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen have put forward a series of in-depth questions and comments which I wholeheartedly support.</p>
<p class="contents">We attach a great deal of importance to the annual report which will be issued about the implementation of the public access regulation and it is very significant for us that we have heard the Council’s and the Commission’s explanation here today. When I hear the comments about the institutional tale of the Secretaries-General, I am of the same opinion as my colleagues; namely that it sounds as if we are putting it on an official institutional level instead of on a political one. If you say general and policy criteria, then I would rather speak on a political level. The 3 December deadline came around very quickly, of course, and we ourselves were only ready in November.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to put our money where our mouth is. But then I look at the Council and I notice that the documents relating to the Justice and Home Affairs Council have not yet been released, or that not all documents have been included in the register. Then things start getting tricky again, because then I think: let’s make giving access to our citizens our number one priority, otherwise it sounds as if we are being contemptuous.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two specific questions for the Commission and the Council in addition to my colleagues’ questions. How many sensitive documents have been included in the register so far? How are the Commission and the Council informing citizens about the possibilities offered by the Act on the public nature of Government, apart from the guide which Commissioner Barnier announced?</p>
<p class="contents">The Act on the public nature of Government is to be evaluated in 2004. If it then turns out that the regulation does not guarantee sufficient public access, it will be our duty as Parliament to make sure that it does, because we must never lose sight of the fact that the picture that our citizens have of us sitting working in little closed rooms must never be accurate.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation is a fantastic way of doing this differently, but we will have to ensure that it is not just a series of fine words and that it can actually be implemented in practice. I am greatly looking forward to hearing the answers, particularly to my colleagues’ critical questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Petitions, and to follow on from what Mr Perry has already said, I should point out that this is not the first time the Commission has refused to divulge the contents of documents and other records which we need to see if we are to draw the right conclusions and make the right decisions in cases where European citizens have taken recourse to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This refusal on the part of the Commission infringes, in my view, the principle of transparency and hampers the Committee on Petitions in its work. The main excuse for the Commission's refusal is that the information and documents requested would disclose sensitive personal data. The merits of this contention are contested both by the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman. To give you an example, the Commission refuses to give us the names of the representatives of a professional organisation whom it consulted and who, it appeared, influenced its decision. We deny that this is how personal data is protected and are worried that a possibly less than transparent deal is being hushed up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry also referred to the Lloyd´s affair. I have to tell you that this hush-up conceals bankrupt companies, a great deal of human misery and several suicides, which is why the report by the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Gemelli, which Plenary adopted today, calls for the powers and efficiency of the Committee on Petitions to be enhanced so that petitioners can obtain justice promptly and avert irreparable damage, for example to the environment or cultural monuments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the committee on an institutional level is concerned, I would reiterate that the Council has no objections at all to this committee starting work; the only question is whether it will be beneficial for the presidents to meet and take the decisions? If it is a question of general principles, I do in fact believe that it will have to be the presidents who do this, although this is only my personal point of view. The solution I have outlined does in fact provide for this. The only thing that I personally do not regard as a favourable development is the situation where the presidents would become a kind of court of appeal, as it were, if a common decision not to permit access to a certain document or a certain type of document has been taken at the highest official level. I think that the result will be like a game of ping-pong right up to the highest official level. I would, however, like to emphasise that the political level is of course always accessible and politically responsible for what the official level decides, including what the highest official level decides. I do not understand the distinction that some of you are making, as if the official level should by definition not be responsible and the political level should be to the greatest possible degree. This is not the case; this is not my philosophy; it may be yours, but I do not share it. I think that we must take another clear look at these things.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been pointed out that there are a number of Council documents relating to justice and home affairs that have not yet been included in the Register. That is right. We are waiting for the Rules of Procedure on guaranteeing the security of documents, which your Parliament has yet to vote on. Until such time as this has been done, we find it particularly difficult to make highly sensitive documents accessible, even to your worthy institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In general, I am not surprised at the expressions of impatience and vigilance, and at the calls for further action directed at the Commission. Mrs Maij-Weggen, you reminded us, although I had already done so, that the Commission arrived at its decision after several days extra delay, which we really needed. As you can imagine, I took part in all these debates within the College to assess the implications of this new system, this new instrument for the internal organisation of the Commission. However, I have assured you, very candidly, that these extra days we required in no way prevented the system from coming into operation on 3 December. Ladies and gentlemen, there have indeed been results since 3 December, as I said to Mr Bonde, who asked me about this. Since then, we have already received quite a number of inquiries. These have been processed by the Commission’s services, according to the new procedures. Mrs Maij-Weggen, the register you mentioned will come into operation in June, on 3 June next year. You also remarked that there is some uncertainty over the author of the report, as did Mr Cashman. We refer to the author of the document in Article 8 of our text. We have not gone into further details on this as, naturally, the author’s description depends on the nature of the document. Documents may be written by an institution, another public authority, a natural person, a civil servant or a private company. I would therefore like to explain that the precise description of the author depends of course on the nature of the document. However, this register will indeed come into operation on 3 June next year, we are working to meet this deadline. Mrs Maij-Weggen, I would also like to say that the Secretariat-General has a centralised management structure. As I said a few minutes ago, we have, for instance, an e-mail address, a postal address and a fax number that can be used. We can therefore reply to people if they write to any specific Directorate-General. If a problem arises, the Secretariat-General acts as arbitrator. However, we have a central main address and the Directorates-General can reply. Of course, the decision is taken in the first instance by the Directorate-General which produced the document.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the definition of the document, a subject you are all concerned with. Mrs Maij-Weggen, as I said when I spoke a few minutes ago, we did indeed restrict ourselves to reading the text of the regulation which gives a broad and neutral definition. This was the wish of the Community legislator and we did not want to limit the scope of our own Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the security rules, which you and Mr Cashman also mentioned, I can confirm that these rules, adopted at the end of November, will be published very shortly. Publication is only being delayed by legal and language issues. I would like to ask for your understanding on this matter. However, the security rules will be published very shortly. In any case, in the light of what you both said on this matter, we will further increase the speed of work towards publication.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cashman, you also referred to the need for a publicity campaign. I promise you we will ensure that information on this new regulation, the arrangements entailed and the new provisions available to citizens is disseminated as widely as possible. Unless I am very much mistaken, the three European institutions decided not to hold a publicity campaign on this regulation at the forum of the inter-institutional technical working party. However, we will publicise the existence of this citizens’ guide thorough our website and all our documents. The citizens’ guide will be available online in the near future. We will henceforth promote this transparency and openness as endorsed or extended by this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hautala, you mentioned the issue of the inter-institutional committee, as did Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, I cannot elaborate further on what I have already said, though I do appreciate Parliament’s concern over a sense of political responsibility. Mrs de Palacio’s compromise proposal endeavours to go as far as possible towards meeting Parliament’s wishes. I think you understand this. To sum up, I told Mr Bonde that we have had results. We are receiving our first inquiries and we are processing them according to the new regulation. Mr Perry and Mr van den Berg bear out this concern for vigilance. I believe that this regulation can bring about real progress. Maybe other regulations will go further. We will see the effects of change as we go along. I promise that the Commission is wholeheartedly committed to implementing this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the need for transparency and democracy as far as citizens are concerned. The regulation is an initial response to this. We must also respond in other ways. This is also one of the issues of institutional reform and the Laeken Declaration. It is also the subject of the open debate that will be possible within the framework of the convention and the forthcoming reform in 2004. In my opinion there is still much to be done to increase transparency and democracy and to ensure citizens are more closely involved in the decisions we take.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, Mr Marinos asked me a question on the ability of the Committee on Petitions to access documents. Access is of course possible, though we must respect the protection of personal data. The documents of third parties can be accessed but they remain protected by Article 4 of the regulation, which must be adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Cashman asked me a question on the significant issue of the Ombudsman. I would like to respond to this. Although I know that you are aware of this, I would like to confirm that the Treaty and the very statute of the Ombudsman means that complaints from third-country citizens living outside the Union cannot be dealt with. This is all I wanted to say to you. Thank you again for your contributions and your vigilance. Your reactions came as no surprise to me. We shall henceforth take them into account when implementing this regulation in a specific and operational manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is this the way in which the principle of transparency is to be applied, for two days ago it was impossible to discover which regulations you had adopted on access to documents. It is reminiscent of Orwell’s <span class="italic">Animal Farm</span>, where some are more equal than others. Despite searching, I have been unable to obtain access to your decision. This is not the way that transparency should function, with its taking more than a week to obtain information.</p>
