<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fabra Vallés,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Court of Auditors</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, on 15 November 2004, I presented the European Court of Auditors' Annual Report for 2003 to the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">I was able on that occasion to provide a detailed account of the findings and conclusions contained in our report. Today I should like to focus my presentation on the Court's findings in three areas: the statement of assurance, budgetary management and the process of reform of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Chapter 1 of the Court's Report contains the Statement of Assurance – the DAS – which is published in the Official Journal together with the Community's consolidated accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the previous financial year, the Statement of Assurance is based on four pillars, which are the result of changes in the methodology employed by the Court in order to make the results of its work more solid. The four pillars are the following: firstly, the quality of the EU institutions' and the Member States' control systems; secondly, an examination of a sample of commitments and payments for each area of expenditure; thirdly, the annual declarations of the Directors-General of the Commission; and, fourthly, examining the work of other auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this auditing work, the Court believes that the consolidated annual accounts for 2003 presented by the Commission were drawn up in accordance with the Financial Regulation. The accounts accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure for the financial year, and the financial situation of the Union, the sole exception being the recording of the transactions relating to the sundry debtors item.</p>
<p class="contents">As in previous years, the Court points out that, in 2003, the Commission's accounting system was unable to guarantee that all of its assets had been correctly recorded. The plan which the Commission adopted in 2002 to modernise its accounts is due to take effect in 2005. In the Court's view, the full implementation of all of the new rules and accounting plans will require a considerable effort on the part of the bodies whose accounts are to be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the legality and regularity of the transactions and as far as revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure are concerned, the Court believes that the underlying transactions are legal and regular.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other Chapters of the budget, the Court's observations concern general shortcomings in the supervisory systems and controls for the management of EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Chapter on agriculture, payments were again affected by material errors. In the field of structural measures, weaknesses in the Member States' management and control systems have persisted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Chapters on internal policies, external actions and pre-accession expenditure, errors affecting the legality and regularity of the transactions have also been detected.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, and in spite of the considerable efforts made by the European Institutions in recent years, the European Court of Auditors recommends that a greater effort should be made as regards the management and control systems in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court stresses once again that the areas of shared, indirect or decentralised management are the ones where most errors continue to appear and that it is in these areas that a greater effort needs to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Court Opinion No 2/2004 on the single audit model, to which I shall refer later in greater detail, is a concrete proposal to improve the control systems which could in turn help to improve the management of EU funds in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now refer to the comments on budgetary management. The total payments budget in the financial year 2003 was EUR 98 000 million; payments amounting to EUR 90 500 million were made, that is, an increase of approximately 6% when compared with the financial year 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget surplus fell considerably, from EUR 15 000 million in 2001 to EUR 7 000 million in 2002 and EUR 5 500 million in 2003. Despite this improvement, the Court believes that the budget surplus is still high and is indicative of systematic problems which must be resolved by improving the budget estimate.</p>
<p class="contents">The main cause of the surplus is still the difference between estimated and actual expenditure. The Court points out that it would not be realistic to expect the budget to be implemented in full given that 80% of the EU budget is managed on a joint or decentralised basis and depends on the Member States for implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in the financial year 2003 the rate of implementation for payments was 92%, which is a considerable improvement when compared with the figure of 86% for the previous financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the budgetary management of the European Development Funds, we note that efforts have been made, with the revised form of the report on financial management, to improve the quality of information about the management for the financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made a considerable effort to reduce the volume of outstanding commitments. Furthermore, the implementation of payments has been affected by a shortfall in financial resources: EUR 270 million. In order to round off its report, the Commission should ensure that it reflects the costs of managing the European Development Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end my presentation with a few words about the state of the administrative reform launched by the Commission in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In February 2004 the Commission published a report on the degree of implementation of the actions proposed in the White Paper on reform. The Court of Auditors recognises that the Commission has made progress with the new control framework but believes that the results are still not satisfactory as regards the implementation of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Court's view, in the case of eight of the actions that had theoretically been completed by the end of 2003, including those relating to the minimum standards for internal control or the internal audit capability within each Directorate-General, the degree of implementation is still not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Court feels that in spite of the progress made the implementation of the Commission's internal control standards still cannot be considered sufficient to provide reasonable assurances as to the legality and regularity of the transactions. The Court urges the Commission to complete the task of implementing the new internal control system, especially in the areas of shared management, risk analysis and debt recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it should not be forgotten that the Commission's reform is based on the principle of responsible management, the rendering of accounts and the evaluation of results. To this end, in the financial year 2003 the European Commission presented, for the first time, an analysis of the reliability of its supervisory and control systems with regard to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. In this way, the Commission assumed management responsibility for the EU budget, as required by Article 274 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reports that it is still unable to make an unconditional declaration in one key area of its management, the Structural Funds, a situation confirmed by the Court of Auditors' observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas of management, the Commission relies on the declarations of the Directors-General, 21 of which contained reservations. These reservations limit the guarantees offered by the Directors-General in their declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court also believes that the Commission's efforts and the progress it is making will not be sufficient unless they are also accompanied by an improvement in the audits of EU funds which are carried out by the various authorities responsible for managing the funds at national level. The European Court of Auditors addressed this theme in its Opinion No 2/2004, published last April, on the feasibility of introducing a single audit model, to which I referred at the beginning of my speech. This Opinion was delivered at the request of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the single audit model is to develop, within the European Union, an efficient and effective internal control framework guaranteeing the reliability of the findings and enabling them to be used by all parties taking part in control activities. This is a field in which the European institutions and the Member States, in cooperation with the national audit institutions, can work together very closely to develop a legal framework for improving the audit of EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude my speech, I should like to depart from our agenda if I may. As you are aware, my term as President of the Court ends in January 2005. I will therefore have completed the three-year period which began with the presentation in the COCOBU of the Court’s work programme for 2002. During these three years, I have worked to promote and maintain the best possible working relationship with the European Parliament, principally through cooperation with its Committee on Budgetary Control. We have promoted more effective communication, exchanges of information and greater cooperation between our institutions. I believe that the overall result is positive and that every day the Court provides the Parliament with independent and professional assistance of ever-higher quality. This can only be achieved if the independence and roles of our respective institutions are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Court has undertaken an internal reform of its organisation and structure in order to make the institution more effective in the performance of its duties and to make a Court of 25 Members more flexible and efficient. The aim of this reform, which is a direct consequence of enlargement and of the Treaty of Nice, has been to ensure that the Court operates effectively within its legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Court has worked with the Audit Institutions of the new Member States to prepare them for their important role in providing liaison for the Court's audits in their respective States. These and other technical and human-resources measures will help us to continue to improve our work in an enlarged Europe. Today I believe that we can celebrate the achievement of these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This concludes my presentation. Many thanks, ladies and gentlemen, for your kind attention. <span class="italic">Molt agrït </span>[Thank you very much]<span class="italic">.</span></p>

Let me first of all thank Mr Fabra Vallés for his speech and say once more that I am very satisfied with the fair and balanced manner in which the Court of Auditors has presented its annual report. I would like to assure the Court and this Parliament that the Commission will give its full attention to the findings and recommendations of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, let me address what I believe to be the most essential political aspect of the whole process. This essential political question has to do with the negative background to the positive statement of assurance, the so-called DAS. This stems from the fact that for the tenth year running, the Court of Auditors has felt unable to issue a fully positive statement of assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">This so-called anniversary was greatly relished by the Euro-sceptic press – and some politicians – who used the negative statement of assurance to present distorted and disproportionate claims about the handling of EU funds in general. The situation stayed relatively quiet this year, but only because the Eurosceptic press was too busy dealing with the delay in the investiture of the Barroso Commission. However, regardless of how distorted the information may be, and the measures we may take to state our case, year after year this negative perception continues to affect public opinion, referenda, and pan-European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This inevitably provokes the questions: ‘Who is to blame for the fact that the European Court of Auditors’ statements of assurance have been negative for a whole decade?’ and ‘What should we do about it?’</p>
<p class="contents">If we asked the Commission whose fault it was, their simple answer would be to put the blame on the Member States for poor implementation of the payment system, and on the methodology applied.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to ask the Council, it would be easy for them to blame the Commission, who, under Article 274 of the Treaty, clearly hold responsibility for the implementation of the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If we asked the Court of Auditors, they would emphasise their limited human resources and the magnitude of the task. From time to time, they do acknowledge the progress made by the Commission, but since the Treaty does not give them much room for manoeuvre in their approach, the result is a negative statement of assurance. But what, ladies and gentlemen, would the answer of the European Parliament be? On the one hand, Parliament wanted to approve the budget, but on the other hand, the impression has been left that it has taken the negative statement of assurance into account. It is difficult to achieve a balance in such a situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Mr Fazakas is Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control this year, and that Mr Wynn is the discharge rapporteur, with whom we agree on the seriousness of the situation. This means that we can afford to be ambitious. We should all aim higher than just the discharge of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">All four institutions should work together to formulate a joint plan of action for achieving a positive statement of assurance in the near future. This question needs to be resolved, and the Commission is prepared do its part.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly comment on the discussions in the Committee on Budgetary Control. I welcome the timing, format and approach chosen by Parliament this year. In the committee discussions held since last week, substantial questions have been raised attempting to clarify certain essential unresolved issues. In my opinion, this type of approach will enable us to improve the quality of our dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I was glad to see that one of the key issues considered by the committee was the question of how we might achieve a positive statement of assurance on the payments side in the future. A positive statement of assurance should mean that the discharge authority is sufficiently confident that the supervisory and control authorities are aware of expenditure, and that they minimise the risk of irregularities at a reasonable administrative cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite what the Treaty states, the Commission is not in a position to achieve this on its own. We need greater coordination of auditing and budgetary control processes by the Commission, the Member States and the Court of Auditors. The minimisation of risks requires much more effective supervision and control measures, which in turn means filling in the gaps in the audit, and the elimination of any overlaps.</p>
<p class="contents">For payments by Member States, for instance, this means that the Member States would have to issue credible audit certificates that the Commission, which has overall responsibility, can rely on.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the Member States have not been particularly keen to take on this extra responsibility. And perhaps we have failed to motivate Member States sufficiently to take more than a seasonal interest in budgetary discharge issues.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Court of Auditors presented its report to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council last week, my main message to the council was that the discharge is not simply a bilateral affair between the Commission and Parliament. We should try to find more ways and opportunities to remind the Member States of this. Hopefully Parliament and the debate today will help to make progress on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Commission, we will play our part in this. For us, one of the most important challenges is the accounting system. In this regard, I would like to stress that the Commission has made good progress in modernising the accounting system and converting to the accrual accounting method. When the new system is in place in 2005, the Commission will be far ahead of most public administrations in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Fabra Vallés, members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I have not used the time allotted to me to list all the measures taken by the Commission that have been welcomed in the Court of Auditors’ report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me simply note that we are of course pleased with the positive statement of assurance that the Court of Auditors has given on the reliability of the accounts. We are pleased that the improvements in this year’s presentation of the accounts have been acknowledged. And we certainly appreciate the unconditional positive statement of assurance that the Court of Auditors has given in respect to its own resources, commitment appropriations and administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I have the opportunity to return the compliment: the fact that the European Union’s financial management has significantly improved on all levels, guaranteeing EU citizens greatly improved cost-effectiveness, is to a large extent due to the Court of Auditors’ reports. I would like to thank Mr Fabra Vallés most sincerely for the invaluable contribution of the Court. The 2003 budget discharge procedure has begun. I want to conclude by repeating that all institutions have both an interest and a responsibility in taking an active part in the process ahead. My colleagues and I in the Commission are keen to discuss with you how we can attain the best result, and the best way to assess it. I believe this is in all our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that this year’s report points to improvements in the use of the EU budget and there have been steps forward in strengthening financial control. However, as the Commissioner mentioned, we feel increasingly frustrated about the negative statement of assurance. The report also points to continued shortcomings, particularly in the case of agriculture and structural measures, where EU money is spent jointly or directly by the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a new Member State, I am particularly shocked to learn that a significant amount of money that is allocated to different Member States is regularly left unused. This should send a clear message to national public administrations, particularly in the new Member States, that unless they put their house in order they seriously risk being unable to absorb EU funds, which is certainly not good news.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the new financial perspectives, the continued mismatch between amounts that are budgeted and amounts that are actually spent should also tell us that we can hardly expect to increase the EU budget and increase funding allocations if we are unable to use the money that we already have.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE<span class="bold"> </span>Group will definitely continue to press for a use of the EU budget that is efficient, effective and respectful of the highest standards of integrity. We want taxpayers to feel that their money is being put to good use by the European Union and most importantly that they are getting good value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I feel that we are on the right track but we still have a long way to go. I call on the new Commissioner, whom I congratulate on his appointment, to lead the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 2003 Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors was presented at this session. This is one of the most important functions of the European Parliament, and it marked the beginning of the discharge procedure. President Fabra Vallés offered a comprehensive evaluation for the fiscal year 2003. I would like to express our appreciation for the Court of Auditors’ fair, professional and balanced report.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, our committee introduced the reform of the discharge procedure this year. The complicated, impersonal written queries have been replaced by oral hearings of the commissioners, thus creating open, vibrant and meaningful floors for discussion. A fruitful dialogue has developed between Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors. I would like to thank the Commission’s, and especially Mr Sim Kallas’ positive attitude and cooperative approach. In conclusion, the integration of the European Court of Auditors in the discharge procedure and the emphasis on the role of the rapporteur was overall well-received, as Mr Terence Wynn will talk about later in detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, I should like to wish Commissioner Kallas much success in his new role; I hope for his sake that the European Court of Auditors will be issuing a positive Statement of Assurance at the end of this term.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections will be fresh in most of our minds, and as Commissioner Kallas pointed out in his introduction, one of the main criticisms we always heard was that after ten years, the Commission still has not managed to obtain a positive Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors. That is grist to the eurosceptics’ mill. We must devote every effort to getting that Statement. However, the Court of Auditors should indicate more clearly what exactly the Commission has to do in order for it to be supplied. What are the criteria? Every year, I read that things are improving, but I never know by how much. What are the concrete measures that should be taken? Parliament has made a few suggestions in the past, including an increase in the financial corrections. What exactly was the impact of this? Did the Court of Auditors ever analyse it?</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, we specified in the resolution that if it were to transpire that money in a certain sector was still being used inappropriately, the Commission would have to suspend payment of advances. In the Commission’s response to the Court of Auditors’ remarks, it is stated that this is actually done on a regular basis. What was the precise impact of this? Was it useful? And how do things stand as regards cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and the national courts of auditors? Do national courts of auditors apply the same criteria for the Statement of Assurance as does the European Court of Auditors? Is it not possible for a Member State, at the end of each budget year, to sign a statement that all spending is <span class="italic">bona fide</span>? If that subsequently does not appear to be the case, can the Commission not penalise that country for having taken us for a ride? Those are all concrete measures that could be taken. Could the Court of Auditors analyse this in more detail? I do believe it is important for us to know what we are working towards.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we held a debate on the new financial perspectives. Most countries say that they need more money than the 1% demanded by some Member States. How is this justifiable if it appears, year after year, that the money is not spent properly? The arguments in favour of receiving more money do then tend to lose some of their potency, and so I think that the European Court of Auditors has its work cut out.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also surprised to read about item 0.6 of the General Introduction to the Annual Report 2003. It states that the increase in outstanding commitments has never been as high. By the end of 2003, the commitments amounted to five years’ worth of payments. That is incredibly high. In other words, we could go on for five years without entering into any new commitments. Am I wrong in thinking that this five-year period simply continues to run?</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that a great deal needs to be done. It is unacceptable for us not to have a Statement of Assurance over a period of two or three years. The Commission must set clear criteria, which the European Court of Auditors must verify, while also indicating to what extent the self-imposed goals have been achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have always had a good working relationship and I wanted to say that here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to welcome Commissioner Kallas. I gather that this is his first debate in the plenary and I should like to give him a pat on the back straight away by way of encouragement. I am delighted that Commissioner Kallas has read the letter by the Committee on Budgetary Control and by individual Members, including Mr Bonde and Mr Van Buitenen, and has, as requested, deferred the dismissal of Martha Andreasen for a while, in order to set aside some time for listening and seeing whether that dismissal is really justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fabra Vallés, I listened with great interest to your contribution and, like Mr Mulder and many other Members of this House, I have to say that we get the same story every year. Errors are being made on a massive scale, as we also noticed following the reading of the OLAF report which was published last week. I think that there is, overall, a problem in the follow-up and in that respect, I should like to ask the Court of Auditors specifically to pinpoint legislation and regulations that promote fraud. It may be that the Court of Auditors, in conjunction with Parliament, will have to draw up a timeframe for changing legislation of that kind. The Commission should then respond to these kinds of questions as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I note that the Council is not present, and in my view, it is a disgrace that, year upon year, one of the two branches of the budgetary authority fails to assess and properly monitor the discharge procedure. Similarly, the documents relating to the discharge that we receive from the Council are always embarrassingly insubstantial and do not in fact amount to much. I would therefore like to propose that the Council be asked, from now on, when the Court of Auditors has criticisms to make with regard to aspects of policy areas, to have the individual specialist councils respond to them, so that we can ensure that the discharge procedure of giving discharge by mutual agreement runs more adequately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Little has changed: accounts are not signed off and something like 94% of the data are deemed unacceptable, either unsafe or riddled with error. More than half the Commission’s directors-general signed their declarations with reservations. This is the EU saying ‘I have not got a clue’. It all sounds too familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, so it should. This has been happening for ten long years. In my country any company that submitted one set of unsafe accounts would be dealt with very firmly, but the EU has got away with it – as I have said – for no less than ten years. The great tragedy is that this decade-long saga of corruption and mismanagement is funded by the poor old taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no greater testimony to the impotence of this institution than the fact that such a scandal has been allowed to go on for so long. Yet Marta Andreasen was sacked for telling the truth and Parliament adopted a resolution requiring the Secretary-General and President of the Committee of the Regions to present their apologies to an internal auditor for the harassment that he had endured, but this was not forthcoming. It goes on and on.</p>
<p class="contents">This report attempts to shift the blame for the unholy mess on to the Member States, but we should be under no illusions about where the blame really lies. The European Commission is the exclusive custodian of the monies paid into the European Union by the Member States and it alone holds the power to withhold payments if it observes any form of wrongdoing. Instead the Commission has simply sat on its hands and looked the other way for ten long years.</p>
<p class="contents">But of course it is not only in this place that people should hold their heads in shame. Mr Blair and his colleagues back in Britain should be holding their heads for continuing to pour taxpayers’ money into the European Union at the rate of GBP 1.5 million per hour when they know full well what a mess the whole thing is. The British Government has an obligation to spend taxpayers’ money wisely. It is singularly failing in this operation.</p>

As Conservatives we believe that this is a deplorable state of affairs and share the views of those who wanted to see the flaws in the financial system fully corrected by now. I suspect that in previous years there has been a lack of real priority, even though a Commission was dismissed as a result of some of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mr Kallas, our new Commissioner, in his first appearance. If I remember correctly, he said at his hearing that he will make sure there is zero tolerance in cases of mismanagement and fraud. It is not enough simply to pay lip service to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the previous two speakers, who are here simply to be destructive and critical, we as Conservatives would like to see three priorities over the next five years. The first relates to the accounting system. We have to recognise that significant failings have occurred, but, as the Commissioner and the President of the Court have said, we have a new system coming in. We welcome this important step but we will be monitoring it very carefully to see exactly what it is going to deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the question of whistleblowers, we have often received information – for example in the case of Eurostat – but the information was not followed up. We must have a system that allows people to come forward and say exactly what is going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Last and most important is the question of shared management. I and others thank the President of the Court for his excellent work, because he has focused on the real problem that the European Union faces. It is not so much a question of fraud and corruption but of being able to know where the monies go: whether it is audit certificates from the Member States or whether it happens to be an internal control system, as the President has suggested. We need to be able to ensure that in future we have a positive assessment of the statement of assurance – the DAS. We also need to ensure that we bring the Member States into the system and make the national administrations responsible, so that European monies are fully and properly accounted for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court has changed its methodology – it has moved to the four-pillar system – and the Commission has had the Kinnock reforms, but I still remain convinced that, even from 1 January next year with the new financial regulations and the new accounting systems, we will still not see a positive DAS because of the way things are organised. I would like to address one comment to Mr Titford. In your own country the Department of Social Security has failed to get clearance of its accounts for the last 14 years. The American federal budget has failed to get any clearance of its accounts for the last six years. This is not a unique organisation and it would have helped, Mr Titford, if you had actually taken part in the hearings we held – all six of them. At least Mr Mote turned up on some occasions and put some questions, but then again Mr Mote is an independent UK Independent, not a UK Independent as Mr Titford is.</p>
<p class="contents">But anyway, back to my script. What we have is the Commission saying that it uses the clearance of accounts because that is what it says in the financial regulation. That is how it controls such things as agricultural expenditure. So its attitude is that they can recover the funds – why does the Court of Auditors not include that in the DAS? A point worth making is that when the clearance of accounts is used the money is actually recovered from the Member States. It is not recovered from the farmers or receiving organisations, which means that national taxpayers foot the bill for any irregularities or fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the Court says that to recover is good, but we should have a system where you do not need to recover. The system should be better. Well that is quite understandable. So the Commission then says: yes, but to do what the Court actually wants will cost so much money that it simply will not be cost-effective. That I can also understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be looking at a variety of conclusions from the Committee on Budgetary Control’s six hearings with the Commissioners and the Court. It is obvious to anyone that one of the main problems is that of shared management. As one of the Members of the Court said in the hearings, it is not a problem of control, it is not a problem of audit, it is a problem of management. So I am beginning to think that we need a system which makes the authorising bodies in the Member States responsible for giving assurance on legality and regularity.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems strange that in a shared management system only half of the partnership needs to be responsible. That will mean changes to legislation and it will mean the cooperation of the Council and the Member States. From the Court’s point of view I have yet to be convinced that two of the four pillars as mentioned by Mr Fabra Vallés are reliable.</p>
<p class="contents">I have real concerns about the amount of transactions inspected and I also question the extent to which other auditors’ work is used. We need a regular activity report on the work done with national audits to be sure that the four pillars give a transparent DAS. There will also be the perennial request from Parliament that the Court should sectionalise its DAS so that the budgetary authority knows exactly where the problems lie.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a situation that sees a set of rules from the Court that can never be met by the Commission within reasonable costs no matter what it does, compared with the benefits to be gained. I am not trying to bend the rules, I am trying to make them fit. I am asking the Court to try to establish a set of rules that can be played by. Imagine Barcelona playing Manchester United in the European Cup Final. There is a crowd of 70 000 and all eyes are on the pitch and on the players. The whole of Europe is looking at this. On comes the referee, he walks to the centre spot and he places at the feet of Wayne Rooney not a football, but a rugby ball. As the players try to point out the problems that they may have with an oval ball, he says never mind the ball, get on with the game!</p>
<p class="contents">That, quite frankly, is the attitude that the Court has towards efforts to change the system. It is never mind the ball, get on with the game. However, let us be clear: this analogy does not mean that the Commission or the Member States should be seen as the elites of public administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a final point. Thankfully I am on the temporary committee for the new financial perspectives. We should not agree a new financial perspective until we have resolved this problem of reliability and accountability from the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial statements show weaknesses in the EU’s administration. There are problems in particular with structural measures. Last year a total of EUR 8.3 billion remained unspent. In the middle of the year, payments were reduced by EUR 5 billion, but all the same the statements still show a figure of EUR 3.1 billion for under-utilisation. All in all, the total for unused budgeted payment appropriations for the period 2000-2003 is EUR 34 billion. The consequence of this is that outstanding commitments have grown to EUR 69.3 billion, which means that to pay the arrears we will need the equivalent of appropriations for two years in full.</p>
<p class="contents">The administration of structural policy warrants a thorough re-evaluation when the new regulations are drafted. Another problem is illicit payments paid out of agricultural expenditure, which between 1971 and last year amounted to EUR 3.1 billion. In future we should embark upon a system where unwarranted payments can be directly withheld from aid paid to a Member State the following year and the amount clawed back can remain in that Member State’s account.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial statements and annual auditors’ report that have now been presented are the first to be based on the new Financial Regulation. They are therefore very important for the future. The statement of assurance contained in the report once again gives cause for concern. For the tenth time in succession now the statement is less than wholesome and it does not give any assurance that the Commission’s expenditure with regard to payments is altogether legal and proper. This makes it hard to control the situation. If the Commission has not gone about its business totally legally and properly, the basic assumption should be that it ought to resign. It should have resigned in every one of the last ten years. Legality and proper conduct are the basis of all administration. Only Mr Santer’s Commission resigned, however, and the reasons for that were more political than legal.</p>
<p class="contents">Any assessment of discharge should be based on what is right, as seen from the human point of view. The question arises as to whether the accounts and administration have been attended to in the same way a careful man would attend to his own finances. The nature of the errors made is also a decisive factor. Is it a question here of a difference of opinion regarding interpretation, carelessness, a clear administrative error or intentional fraud? The statement of assurance gives no clear answer regarding the nature of the errors. Something will have to be done about improving administration and auditing work in the future. That is why I agree with the rapporteur for the discharge, Mr Wynn, when he calls for the system to be improved. Yesterday Mr Nicolaï, representing the country to hold the Presidency, also agreed with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As all of us in this House can see, it is however in itself a scandal that this is now the tenth time that the Court of Auditors has not been able to deliver a Statement of Assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that it is not, of course, the Court of Auditors’ job to try to discover fraud and other crimes. That is OLAF’s task and, moreover, there are plenty of such scandals throughout the range of EU activities. Members of the European Parliament and EU officials talk openly of scandals that have never been made public knowledge or given rise to legal action, despite the fact that many people are well aware of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We find that the Court of Auditors cannot approve transactions concerning agricultural policy, structural policy, aid and pre-accession aid. These are far and away the dominant transactions in terms of sums of money, meaning that by far the largest portion of these payments cannot be monitored by citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means that the EU should not go in for paying out money to countries and organisations whose task it then is to spend the money according to the wishes of the EU authorities. It will probably never be possible to monitor such an arrangement. There really are no reasons for carrying on these activities that cannot be supervised in areas such as agriculture, structural policy and aid.</p>
<p class="contents">There are reasons for helping poor EU countries, but such help should be given by means of non-earmarked transfers. Aid to non-EU countries should not be channelled via EU authorities but via UN bodies or else be given directly by the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As an institution, a Court of Auditors ought always to be one of the public’s closest allies. Consider the way the Court of Auditors works these days, and ask yourself whether it can at all be guaranteed that it will be. What has been going on over the past few years? Even now, I remember the massive headlines that the Court of Auditors’ report prompted in 1992. Today, though, people say it is all ‘just the same old thing again’.</p>
<p class="contents">Does our making appointments to 25 important positions within the Court of Auditors represent progress for it or for the European Union, and, if so, what qualitative improvements are there going to be? What I expect of you, Mr Fabra Vallés, is that you now think about what you are doing in the light of what has been said so far, and then I expect us to get stuck in to this debate on matters of principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I go into the report in more detail, though, I have two political comments to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have commented on agricultural policy. I will not deny that things may go wrong from time to time where payments are concerned, but it could never be the intention that the industry should suffer when the Commission or a Member State fails to do things properly and according to the rules. The way it is implemented can never be a reason for re-opening an attack on European agricultural policy with its high standards on food safety, the environment and animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to home in on one specific point in the report, namely the EU’s animal disease policy. The Court of Auditors is right in saying that the abolition of the non-vaccination policy in the early 90s was based on assumptions. Those assumptions have changed dramatically. The number of slaughterhouses has fallen drastically and the number of cattle transported has grown exponentially. As far back as 1998, the FAO warned the Commission of the implications of this and of the possible spread of animal diseases. I notice that the Commission has done virtually nothing with these warnings. Under pressure from the interim FMD committee, legislation in the field of FMD was changed to some extent, but still not in compliance with the recommendations of the FAO or the OIE – the International Office for infectious animal diseases. This is where a far more dynamic approach on the part of the Commission really would do justice to the Court of Auditors’ report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three things that the Commission should tackle. First of all, it needs to ensure that the non-vaccination policy is reviewed and that vaccination becomes the norm, which is also laid down worldwide in line with the OIE’s requirements. Secondly, it has to be implemented in a uniform way in each Member State. Thirdly, the whole to-do about European regulations, including with regard to the payment of slaughter premiums, should never again stand in the way of this policy’s implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their reports in the past have been more feeble than this one, which I regard as an important and good one, particularly as we are about to negotiate a Financial Perspective. The Commission bears a great deal of responsibility in this respect. It is simply not on that we should end up getting stick from the finance ministers of those very countries that are not implementing the Structural Funds, when we have been shovelling over EUR 100 billion in that direction in particular. This, Commissioner, is where we have to change the objectives for the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is the case when we see, yet again, where the major shortcomings and the frauds are to be found. Here I am thinking of the whole area of export refunds for agricultural produce. The ball is now in the Commission’s court. For as long as we have policies like this in the European Union, we will carry on seeing headlines slating European policy. The lesson this report can teach us is that these policies need to be abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point to which I would like to draw attention is the fact that we set up pre-accession aid for the ten new Member States. Until these countries acceded, we were seeing 15% of it taken up. Today I have heard from the Commissioner with responsibility for SAPARD that funds are flowing out of it at a marvellous rate, even though it is an instrument for use before accession rather than after it. There will be more enlargements; indeed, they are already imminent. Let us learn a lesson from this one. This is the Commission’s responsibility, and this is where things can be speeded up a bit. If they are, this report will turn out to be a great success. The people at the Court of Auditors are not historians, nor are we in this House. We want to draw positive conclusions from the points of criticism made by the Court of Auditors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Each year, the European Parliament and the Member States take note of these factors, and nothing changes. Nothing changes because Europe has become a huge bureaucratic machine in which no one is really responsible any longer, a conclusion also reached through the analysis in the Independent Experts’ Report that led to the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, OLAF has neither the means nor the will to monitor proper use of Community funds, and the Member States tend to protect nationals of theirs who are suspected of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it is time that the Member States, which are the main contributors to the Community Budget, monitored the funds appropriated to them and checked that they were being properly administered, severely penalising offenders including those guilty of fraud. Otherwise, we shall receive the same report from the Court of Auditors every year, denouncing the same evils, but to absolutely no practical effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the Second World War, Churchill, when talking about Eastern Europe, made the comment on the Eastern European countries – exactly those who have just rejoined Europe – that they had been swallowed by The Soviet Union and after the meal comes the digestion period. Let me reconsider this thought of digestion, namely the so-called pre-accession funds, that allow these states to participate in European processes as soon and as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me point out that the Court of Auditors’ report is very sincere regarding pre-accession funds. Its examination method is clear, and therefore indicative of the future as well, as it can be used to examine the same funds in later years. Its observations are correct, and as my colleague, Mr Bösch said, the pre-accession funds provided very little if any help at all to the ten new Member States. For example, three years after the establishment of the Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development, 14.8% of the funds had been allocated. The report also observed that the authorities of the candidate countries overcomplicated conditions for these funds. In conclusion, the Court of Auditors are helping political decision-making and the feedback process with its report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as a new Member of Parliament, I must express my disappointment and consternation, because this year once again – and listening to the honourable Members who have been here much longer, their disappointment is even greater – the presentation of the annual report is a frustrating exercise; all the efforts and progress made by the various institutions, and ultimately by the Commission at the request of the European Parliament, are still not enough to achieve a positive statement of assurance. There have been more reservations than progress, and the citizens are still receiving bad news about irregularities and unsatisfactory situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that ten years is a long time, enough time, and that at this time when we are beginning the negotiation of new financial perspectives, in an enlarged Europe of 25, which is soon to be 27, it is extremely urgent that we reach a compromise amongst the institutions, so that shared responsibilities can finally be clarified and we can thereby prevent the increasing danger of renationalisation, those sirens’ songs from people who, discouraged by the annual bad news about the accounts, believe the solution is to reduce the Union’s budgets and return to less Community formulae, with less solidarity and less cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it unacceptable, ladies and gentlemen, to see Eurosceptics and renationalisers exploiting the report of the Court of Auditors and our inability to achieve a positive statement of assurance to attack the very heart of the European Union, its economic and social cohesion and its future policies. I would, therefore, appeal to the Commission – to Mr Kallas, who on this first day has shown great will – and to the Court of Auditors – to Mr Fabra Vallés, with his experience – to ensure that we find an innovative route, a firm institutional commitment with the European Parliament – naturally – which leads us to a positive statement which provides the European citizens with the guarantee that their contribution to European integration is properly planned and properly spent and contributes to the added value we all seek. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a new MEP, I have to say that the report made very exciting reading. Even though the language of the Court of Auditors is polite, the criticism is devastating. I am amazed that the inadequacies were so great, and I think that ten years without a positive auditors’ report is unambiguous in its implications.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the most notable inadequacies probably lie in what is most fundamental, specifically the accounting system. We cannot accept anything less than that these problems be tackled without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like right now, however, to focus upon something really quite different. In recent days, two important issues have been debated here in plenary: this auditors’ report and the issue of the EU’s financial perspectives. I think it is high time that these two issues were linked together.</p>
<p class="contents">The auditors’ report contains important and fundamental criticism of which account must be taken in planning for the future. Having read the report, it is obvious that, in many areas, the EU does not have the opportunity to spend allocated money in a sensible way; yet, despite this, most people appear to argue in favour of more money. In the same way, the Court of Auditors shows that limited use is made of EU money in many areas; nonetheless, it is in precisely those areas that many wish to invest more money.</p>
<p class="contents">In those areas in which there is a great need for reforms and in which there are many problems, the latter are not solved through our appropriating more money. For precisely that reason, I should really like to address not merely the Commission but, specifically, the Members of this House and others, and call upon all those who wish seriously to debate the issue of the financial perspectives, or the EU’s economic future, actually to read this auditors’ report and to take its contents very seriously indeed. There is a very great deal that is of fundamental importance in the report and that will pass the EU by if no account is taken of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is indeed the most worrying aspect of this situation, all the more so given that the most significant case that we debated in this House during the last legislature was that of <span class="italic">Italburro</span>, which began in October 1999 when OLAF was alerted by the Italian police to fraud, the cost of which to the Community budget was put by the Italian police at EUR 100 million.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with the greatest surprise that I heard this newly installed Commission say in November 2004 that there was no firm allegation of any loss to the Community budget. This is utterly incredible and demonstrates the seriousness of this unresolved problem of large-scale fraud in the large-scale food industry in Europe, as I have said countless times in this House. It is this problem, more than any minor formal irregularity, to which I should like to draw the attention of this House, of the Commission and, especially, of Mr Kallas, who is attending this debate with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court indicates that nearly 95% of the EU budget has serious problems with regard to accountability and effective spending. Two years ago Marta Andreasen, the Commission’s chief accountant, raised many problems regarding the EU’s accounts. Instead of listening to her and acting on her advice, the Commission briefed against her, suspended her from her job and then, two weeks before the old Commission retired, fired her.</p>
<p class="contents">People in Europe are sceptical about many EU issues but their biggest worry is the fact that the European Union is unable to have properly signed-off, audited accounts. This situation cannot continue, because it will bring the European Union into more and more disrepute. It is imperative that the new Commission act immediately to restore the confidence of the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of Parliament’s Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I now wish to focus on the Court’s special report on the 2001 crisis. The Court’s report points out the UK Government’s many failures during FMD. There were no provisions to handle a serious outbreak of disease and there were no proper financial controls to manage the outbreak. The Court also identified many major problems over animal movements. The three-day delay by the government in banning animal movements allowed the disease to spread rapidly, resulting in double the number of animals being slaughtered. The lack of financial control by the UK Government resulted in the EU Commission disqualifying nearly two thirds of Britain’s claim and some GBP 948 million of emergency EU funds. This has led to the UK taxpayer losing some GBP 600 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors’ special report on foot and mouth has highlighted yet again the need for a full public inquiry to be held in the United Kingdom into the FMD outbreak of 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
