<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stockton (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the case of the Reverend Raymond Owen raises a number of interesting, not to say esoteric, points. Members may feel that whether a priest is employed by his or her church or by God is a question that must have been decided decades, if not centuries, ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing this report, I took informal advice from leading churchmen, but have only received a formal submission from the Archbishop's Council of the Church of England on 4 November 2002. Not surprisingly, there are certain parts of the report with which they do not agree. I will come back to them shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the fundamental questions of principle thrown up by this case include whether members of the clergy should enjoy the same rights as other citizens. As I have made clear in the report, while Directive 2000/78/EC establishes a general framework, I accept that certain types of worker must be dependent on definitions in national legislation and implementation. I also accept that Directive 91/533/EEC, while applying to clergy in some Member States, does not apply in the UK, and that the various directives are vague and imprecise in their reference to workers, employees and the working population. Who falls into which category is frequently left to be defined by national law. Members may be interested to note that while our staff and assistants are clearly employees, we are not covered by any of these definitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the report accept and include those of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is the committee with the competence and expertise on most of the issues raised by the petitioner. I have to say that my opinions, and those of my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation, are somewhat at odds with some of the conclusions reached but after exchanges of views, however, it was clear that the report faithfully reflects the consensus of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The submission presented by the petitioner highlighted prima facie evidence of shortcomings in the Church of England's procedures. In fairness, I must tell the House that since the committee adopted the report, the Church of England has pointed out that the decision taken was not to terminate Reverend Owen's tenure of office. Rather, it was a decision not to grant an extension beyond the 18-month extension allowed in Section 20 of the 1983 Pastoral Measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should remind the House that as the Church of England is an established church, its rules and regulations form part of the canon of the law in England, although not in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is clearly not the role of either the committee or this House to adjudicate in questions of fact. Equally, it is accepted that the Petitions Committee is not a judicial body and nor should it exercise or try to exercise a quasi-judicial function.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is clear that the directives in the area of employment, and in particular the aforementioned Directive 91/533/EEC, are confusing and even inconsistent. Accordingly, the report calls for a review to clarify this position. In parenthesis, this only serves to underline the wisdom of the former Conservative government in opting out of the Social Chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, while we accept that where protection is afforded to workers by European legislation, it should extend as widely as possible. It would be quite wrong for the European Union to try to impose a monolithic structure that would not allow for diversity in cultural, religious and social customs in Member States. This is a sentiment that I am sure will be heartily endorsed, not just in Lambeth Palace, but also in the Vatican.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore it is my sincere hope that, as pointed out in paragraph 12 of the report, the Commission works with Member States to find the means of securing for workers with distinct constitutional status all the employment rights consistent with their national policies as soon as possible to avoid further such confusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Petitions and the members of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for their excellent work and analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">As reported by the Earl of Stockton, Reverend Owen alleges that his fundamental rights have not been respected and that European directives have either been breached or incorrectly applied by the United Kingdom authorities. In his petition, he refers in particular to the fact that he has been discriminated against, contrary to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and contrary to Articles 48(2) and 112 of the Treaty of Rome. He furthermore claims that Council Directive 91/533/EEC concerning information on individual employment conditions has not been properly incorporated into UK law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have been dealing with this issue for more than one and a half years and a lot of legal and other work has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned in the Commission Communication of 13 December 2001 on the case, and in my letter of 11 January 2002 to honourable Members Ford, Cashman and Hughes, the Commission could not identify any breach of European law, nor any failure by the British Government to transpose properly the relevant European legislation into UK law.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe I need to add anything to what I have already communicated in my letter, but I will attempt to explain and analyse some of the aspects of the directives and the articles of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Council Directive 91/533/EEC applies to every paid employee having a contract or employment relationship defined by the law in force in a Member State. It does not, however, provide an EU definition of an employee, which is left to national employment legislation. The United Kingdom confirmed that members of the clergy, in respect of their core duties as clergymen, are officeholders and not employees under UK employment law. As clergy are not employees for the purpose of the scope of this directive, it was not necessary to specifically cover or specifically exclude them.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of discrimination, Article 13 of the EC Treaty allows the Community to take action but has no direct effect. It does not, therefore, grant individuals any rights which can be enforced by national courts or the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishes a general principle of prohibition of any direct or indirect discrimination. However, the directive does not need to be transposed by Member States until 2 December 2003 so we cannot apply it to this case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 48(2) of the Treaty of Rome (now Article 39(2)) refers to the treatment of workers of different nationalities within a Member State, and not to differences in labour law and employment rights between countries. It is therefore not obvious that Article 39 is relevant in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 118 of the Treaty of Rome (now Art. 137), which I suppose the Reverend had in mind as regards the harmonisation of working conditions, gives the Community a number of competences in the social field, including the issue of working conditions. On the basis of these considerations I cannot identify any breach of European law nor any failure by the British Government to transpose the relevant European legislation. I hope that this clarifies the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament is therefore grateful for his petition since it draws attention to a problem with the law.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Earl of Stockton has already pointed out, because directives use a variety of terms to identify the range of working people they cover, and because that range is often left to be determined by national law, certain groups may fail to benefit from the protection they afford. It is of course accepted that there can be some differences, both in the extent of employment rights, and in the means of redress in the event of breach. This is particularly so where those involved have a particular constitutional status. Members of this or any other parliament would not, for example, be expected to be able to appeal to an industrial tribunal against the decision of the electorate not to return them for a further term.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, all those in a working situation should have the fullest possible set of rights with deviations permissible only where these can be fully and objectively justified. In the case of the clergy, such rights may not be for the secular authorities to determine, but surely in such instances the churches themselves should aspire to the highest possible standards, particularly where avenues of redress and issues of discrimination are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the petition we are asking the Commission to review European employment legislation to ensure that it is as comprehensive as possible. It is good to know that, in the UK, such coverage is something to which the Department of Trade and Industry is already directing its attention.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also asking for constructive dialogue across the European Union to secure for all those in non-typical but economically dependent working situations – including, where necessary and by appropriate means, the clergy – all the employment rights, both substantive and procedural, that must be regarded as fundamental to a dignified working life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as you suggested this may seem something of an obscure and even idiosyncratic issue to reach the floor of the European Parliament. For the Reverend Owen, however, it is anything but obscure. It is his livelihood, his home and I suspect even more than that, it is his belief that right will be done, that justice will prevail. It would seem that the legal system cannot defend him, although he has done no wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasingly, I fear that appeals to a moral principle do not work, although one might have hoped that within the Church of England, and I am myself a communicant member of that church, such an appeal might get some countenance. I am afraid that once the lawyers of the consistory courts don their wigs and gowns it is the letter of the law that will prevail, rather than moral justice and still less Christian spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the publicity of this case is making the bishops of the Church of England feel just a little ashamed. If the Church cannot set an example of Christian charity, understanding and fair treatment towards its servants, who can? The Church should not be surprised if its pews are increasingly empty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a clear tribute to the democratic procedures of this House, and to the work of the Petitions Committee, that the Reverend Owen has at last found one public body which is at least ready to listen, one that does not require expensive lawyers. I trust that His Grace, the new Archbishop of Canterbury will carefully consider this small and obscure case and show that the Church has not totally lost its belief in Christian charity, and might accord to his rector the rights that other European citizens enjoy as employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group and as a member of the Petitions Committee I welcome both the report from the Earl of Stockton and the opinion from the Employment and Social Affairs Committee drafted by Mrs Attwooll.</p>
<p class="contents">The Reverend Owen is actually in the gallery today listening to this debate. His case is very simple. He was employed as a team rector in Stoke-on-Trent for a number of years. There was a secretive and flawed review of his work in the post and a decision was made at a meeting, without proper notice, that he was to be sacked. He was given no reasons for his dismissal. Like any employee he believed he had the right to an independent appeal against this casual ending of 30 years' work with the Church and a threat to his tied accommodation. Without a post in the Church he would be evicted from his family home.</p>
<p class="contents">To cut a long story short, he was refused access to an industrial tribunal in the United Kingdom because of a 1911 judgment that members of the clergy have no terrestrial employer, that is, he is employed by God, although God does not sign his stipend cheques at the end of the month. However, employment legislation and the world have moved on since 1911. For example, women even have the right to vote, and, in the United Kingdom, female teachers no longer have to resign on getting married. Even in the EU, we have legislation that should apply in this case. No longer when you join the Church should have you have to leave your basic civil rights at the door. The Employment and Social Affairs Committee backs that argument, the Petitions Committee backs that argument. We believe that clergy throughout Europe should have the same employment rights as millions of other workers, the same rights as they enjoy already in Denmark, and in the United Kingdom if they happen to be hospital or prison chaplains. So there is even an anomaly within the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope the UK Government and the Commission will look again at this matter. I still believe that the directives have not been properly implemented in UK law. The Reverend Owen seems to meet all the criteria for being an employee. That the Reverend Owen has been badly treated by the Church of England seems very clear, and we hope that on the basis of this particular case, which is illustrative of a much more general problem affecting hundreds of clergy in the United Kingdom every year, the Commission will press the UK Government to close the loophole for future cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom, there are 30 000 clergy treated in this feudal manner: more than the number of those employed in the mining industry. Across Europe, close to a quarter of a million clergy, encompassing all faiths and religions, are employed and at the moment have some doubts as whether they are covered by this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, while we do not expect miracles, we ask that the Church authorities in the UK practise some of the Christian charity they preach in this particular case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and Mrs Attwooll for providing the opinion for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that this is beginning to sound like a British debate, because a number of the issues here actually apply right across the European Union. As we have heard, the case provides an example of just one of the many anomalies which occur in employment law in many of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally of course these only come to light when people want to cross borders to work and find that their employment status changes and thus their rights to social security and employment-related rights change as well. In this case, as we have been hearing, we are looking at a national situation in which historical anomalies, and to some extent theological anomalies, have led to an unacceptable situation which has already been clearly outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">We found that the Reverend Owen discovered that the means open to him to seek adjudication of his case lay either within the body against which he wished to complain – thus making this body judge, jury and defendant, one of the minimum standards that we do not want to see applied across the European Union – or with a judicial review which can examine the process but not the content of the complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has already pointed out, it appears that the situation is legally correct. Morally, however, it is certainly is not correct. The European Union seeks to establish at least satisfactory core standards in its employment law and expects Member States to implement these standards, and the spirit of them, across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore fully supports the call for Member States to review their employment practices to ensure that situations where individuals are denied access to normal dispute resolution procedures in employment are as few as possible, can be fully and objectively justified, and that redress is available in other forms. We also support the call for clear definitions of employment status to be used. We raised this issue in the discussions on the insolvency directive and will be doing so again in connection with the coordination of social security systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the Earl of Stockton on the production of an excellent report and also Elspeth Attwooll for the very clear opinion she produced for the Employment Committee. I would also like to congratulate the Reverend Owen for the courage and determination he has shown in pressing his case this far. Those attributes, together with his communication, advocacy and other skills, really make me wonder why the Church of England wanted to terminate his services in the first place. I think he would be a considerable asset to any organisation and I hope they will think again.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt in my mind that he has been given a raw deal. Either he had an employment relationship with the Church of England – in which case he would have had the protection of well-established procedures in UK employment law – or he was an office-holder who should have had the protection of the Church of England's own code of recommended practice, including the right of appeal. He seems to have fallen completely between these two stools and therefore a real injustice has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in that context that we need to read paragraph 2 of the Earl of Stockton's report, where it mentions an unacceptable situation in terms of the spirit of Article 136 of the Treaty of Rome, Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms on the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent, impartial tribunal, and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is quite right to underline those references.</p>
<p class="contents">There are broader implications arising from this case, as Jean Lambert has said. There are increasing numbers of workers right across the European Union who find themselves totally dependent upon one source of income but who are not regarded in their national law as having an employment relationship. These quasi-forms of independence and self-employment are spreading. We have been working with the Commission on this for some time and most recently in relation to the latest review of the insolvency directive. The Commission has commissioned a study as a result of our work on that review and it has also committed itself to holding a joint hearing with the Employment Committee to seek to establish common definitions. Without such definitions, it is increasingly clear that larger numbers of workers will find themselves outside the protection of the law. We need to establish definitions which will apply across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to echo the sentiments of other Members in expressing the sincere hope that even at this late hour all of the parties involved in this dispute can get back around the table and, in a Christian manner, right the wrong which has been done to the Reverend Owen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, He has left us the task of organising our labour market and of course clergymen have their civil and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two points. The first one concerns the definition of employees. This is a very difficult and sensitive issue, and we know that in the majority of directives the Member States are left to define what employees are. There are many problems, and, as Mr Hughes has already said, we are moving forward with amendments to two directives in order to define, in a more effective way, the protection of employees and the definition of an employee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer to the questions mentioned in Lord Stockton's report. We have carried out a new study which concerns economically-dependent workers, and a public hearing will be organised with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We believe that after this discussion and after the report, the Commission could draw some new conclusions in the light of the results. This is why I believe that there is always an opportunity after an individual case to move forward and to take into account the particular needs of groups of workers across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
