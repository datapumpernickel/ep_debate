It dates back to an arbitration award by the World Trade Organisation in 1999 which went against the European Union. Since then, we have been forced, so to speak, to import hormone-treated meat from the US and sanctions have been imposed by both sides. I do not want to talk about the past, but I do want to express my pleasure about the fact that we have succeeded in putting an end to all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency has already endorsed my report on behalf of the Council in an informal trialogue. As a result, there are no more obstacles in the way of our vote tomorrow, which will conclude this dispute. Against this background, I would like to ask you all to support my report. It is true that it represents a compromise. However, in my view, the compromise is very balanced. The European agricultural industry in particular will now have the security to plan ahead, which has not necessarily been the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this report is also an important indication of an improvement in transatlantic relations. We must put aside many of our differences of opinion. This is the only way we will be able to establish joint international standards. We should not be under any illusions. Only the US and the EU together will be able to hold their own in tomorrow’s globalised world. Therefore, I also welcome the fact, for example, that we have now set up a high-level working group on jobs and growth in which we can work together to establish the necessary conditions for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to look at one more point and this is an issue which concerns the future. Since the cases of BSE in the EU, the US has had in place an import ban on beef from the EU. However, there is no legitimate scientific reason for this any more, as there have been no BSE cases here for several years. The fact that the US has not yet lifted the import ban is purely due to protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">This is unacceptable. Therefore, as part of this legislative procedure, I have written to all those involved and held a number of meetings. In particular, I have asked the US Secretary of Agriculture, Mr Vilsack, and the US Trade Representative, Mr Kirk, to complete the process of lifting the import ban as quickly as possible. Now I have some very good news for you, which I am particularly pleased about. On Friday, 9 March, the Department of Agriculture in Washington published the draft rule that forms part of the mandatory consultation procedure. This is the first step towards taking the important measures to lift the import ban.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask the United States not to jeopardise the cooperative atmosphere in this area and to complete this process as soon as possible. I would now like to extend my wholehearted thanks to the Commission and to the Council Presidency for their cooperation, but, most of all, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I know that for my fellow Members on the committee, some of the steps in this process have been very difficult, but you have been more than cooperative. I would like to thank you very much for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal to increase the tariff-rate quota for ‘hormone-free beef’ is included in the Memoranda of Understanding signed with the United States in 2009 and with Canada in 2011. By creating reciprocal opportunities in the market on both sides of the Atlantic, these memoranda are a crucial step in bringing an end to a dispute that has lasted for a decade. The United States has got rid of the sanctions affecting some European Union products, whilst the European Union has offered significant access to its market for hormone-free beef.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and the Committee on International Trade fully support this agreement. Phase II of the memoranda are scheduled to come into force on 1 August 2012. I hope that this will lead to the dispute over hormone-treated beef being resolved once and for all at the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very aware of the fact that exports of European veal and beef to the United States are still blocked due to US restrictions related to BSE, as Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl mentioned. As you know, these restrictions are not in line with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) rules, which specify that trade in beef must be authorised between countries in the same risk category, as is the case here. The European Union and the United States are in the same World Organisation for Animal Health risk category, in other words, the controlled risk category.</p>
<p class="contents">I have met Mr Vilsack and we had the opportunity to speak about these matters. Very recently, in Nuremberg in February, I met Mr Vilsack’s assistant at the US Department of Agriculture, to announce the mutual recognition of the rules on organic agriculture. On that occasion, I once again asked the US administration to do everything it can to make progress on the BSE issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned today, we see that draft standards on this issue were published by the Federal Register on 9 March. This publication marks the start of a consultation period with the interested parties and, therefore, also opens the way to clarify this issue which should also be, as I have said, in accordance with international rules and standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will manage to conclude this issue quickly and ensure that beef producers on both sides of the Atlantic can enjoy specific access to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I once again thank the Committee on International Trade, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Parliament as a whole for having very quickly and effectively supported this draft regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This deal negotiated by Baroness Ashton in 2009 will, at long last, draw a line under this issue once and for all. Let us be clear: it is a win-win for both sides. In the EU, we get to keep our ban on hormone-treated imports of beef and we also lose the US trade sanctions that have been put upon many of our exports. In return, the US gets 45 000 tonnes of access to the EU market for high-quality beef cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important step forward in normalising our trade relations with the US and it is already beginning to pay dividends. As the Commissioner rightly pointed out, on Friday, the US announced new BSE rules for beef imports. I would hope that all colleagues in the Chamber here tonight would urge the US Government to adopt these new rules as swiftly as possible and build on and reinforce the trust between both the EU and the US on trade issues. This can only bring benefits to both consumers and producers in the United States and in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the result of the vote in the committee shows that she has succeeded in reaching a good compromise in her report on this sensitive subject. She has my warm congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">By bringing an end to this dispute, both the European Union and the United States have taken a major and important step forward. The agreement on introducing tariff quotas on high-quality, hormone-free beef represents the end of a trade dispute that has had a negative impact on many areas of foreign trade and caused great damage. After several rulings by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and restrictions and trade barriers imposed by both sides, which affected not only the agriculture industry, but also many product areas within the EU, we now have a situation which is safe for European consumers and exporters. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has spoken out clearly in favour of the report in its statement. European citizens do not want hormone-treated meat and European exporters do not want trade barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, this report is a clear win-win situation for all of us. However, we now need to take an assertive approach to resolving the outstanding problems. The ban on imports of European beef into the US is totally unacceptable. It is essential for us to work constructively on this. I would like to make it clear how important it is to put an end to trade disputes, in particular, between the EU and the US, and to devote our energies to other tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is faced with major challenges and must focus on competitiveness, innovation and growth. Trade disputes do not help us in these areas. Unfortunately, disputes of this kind often leave third countries in a better starting position in relation to the European Union. It is important for us to be aware of this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur for her constructive and fruitful work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is, for the first time, playing a fundamental role in approving this sort of decision. This fact increases the United States’ interest in and understanding of Parliament, as we saw first-hand during the meetings held with the US Congress by a delegation from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) last June.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement puts an end to a long-held, age-old dispute, thereby enabling the sanctions imposed by the US to be lifted, while also maintaining the ban on imports of meat treated with hormones so as to guarantee our own high standards on food quality and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the AGRI Committee – which I am honoured to chair – gave staunch support for the conclusion of this agreement and did not present any amendments, in the spirit of deepening transatlantic trade relations and improving dispute resolution within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.

With the rise and growth of the economic power of the BRIC countries, the US and the EU share a huge interest in ensuring that the WTO rules are respected. Long-lasting conflicts such as this one, which has lasted for almost 15 years, do huge damage to effective multilateralism. This report should be used as a stepping stone for broader EU-US trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask our American counterparts to respond in good faith and remove the BSE ban on EU beef. In both the EU and the US, we can benefit from keeping the global perspective in mind. Doing so should push us closer to breaking down trade barriers and moving towards a more integrated trans-Atlantic market space to drive jobs and growth and to launch the free trade negotiations at the next EU-US Summit. Our cooperation should be based on mutual trust, reciprocity and complementarity. In line with this sense of urgency, I believe we should all – Parliament, the Commission and the External Action Service – work to encourage the US to stop any disproportionate protectionist measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The remarks by President Sarkozy, who wants to match the ‘Buy American’ clauses with ‘Buy European’ measures, shows what kind of downward spiral this can lead to, and it would be undesirable. Our perspective should not be focused inward; we should be on the ball and aware of global competition: the competition for trade, talent and, eventually, values.

We export about 70% of everything that we produce, and this is particularly true in the beef sector. My government will, therefore, always be looking for new markets and the opening-up of markets for the beef sector from Northern Ireland. We view this development as a step in the right direction. It rectifies the unjust stance taken by the US in relation to agricultural produce from the EU, and I hope that it can be viewed as recognition of the high-quality, safe and wholesome food that is produced by European farmers and which is so eminently traceable.</p>
<p class="contents">Like others in this Chamber tonight, I would look for an early resolution to the import ban and hope for the early adoption of the new BSE rules by the US. I would also hope that this kind of development will lead to the opening up of further markets for EU agricultural produce, and particularly beef. However, I want to finish tonight with a word of warning, one that is very clear from the beef sector in Northern Ireland. It is that the new proposals for the common agricultural policy have at their heart a disadvantage to the beef sector in Northern Ireland, which tends to be more intensive and is characterised by small family farms, and we fear that the new CAP will only advantage landlords. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are living through the aftermath of a long-standing trade conflict between Europe, on the one hand, and the United States and Canada, on the other. Like those who have already spoken, let us indeed thank the rapporteurs and, in particular, my colleague, Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl, for their work. Let us also, however, add our voice to theirs in the call for support for the implementation of the second phase of the agreement. This victory has been won by European diplomacy; it is the victory of the respect that we owe to Europe’s citizens, as hormone-treated beef is banned once and for all from our stores.</p>
<p class="contents">The sanctions that our transatlantic partners imposed on us to try to make us change our minds did not shake our conviction of the need to find an agreement. Still, the system for restricting entry to their market especially penalised a large number of European food products as import duties, let us remember, could run as high as 300%, which, in fact, pushed them out of these markets. We all remember, in the case of my country, the sorry tale of Roquefort and shallots.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when Europe has to re-establish its trade balance, the end of these sanctions therefore seems like a shot in the arm for European producers. A year has already gone by since the Americans lifted all of the restrictions that they had imposed, eight months prior to the date set out in the agreement. Therefore, we now need to go further. The discussions that we have held have been fruitful. They have shown the extent to which we have been able to work together. Let us then continue to work in the same direction in an informative, demanding and diplomatic manner, but, above all, on the key basis of reciprocity, because reciprocity does not exclude openness. Reciprocity guarantees a win-win situation, mutual respect and joint success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This regulation enables us to resolve a conflict which has been ongoing for many years, as previous speakers have pointed out. The European Union banned imports of hormone-treated meat. The United States and Canada’s response to the European Union was an increase in tariffs on certain products they considered sensitive. This meant products like chocolate, bread, pork products and fruit juices, with the effects felt over a wide area, particularly in my country, in the Levante region.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement is, firstly, good news for European consumers. The European Union was successful in retaining its ban on imports of hormone-treated beef and, in exchange, has agreed an additional quota for imports of high-quality beef.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is beneficial for European producers who were disadvantaged by the tariff increase, which represented an additional burden of EUR 190 million for the European Union: EUR 6 million for my country alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, it thereby increases market quotas for these products in the United States and Canada, whose exports have fallen by 90% over the last ten years. We should therefore also congratulate the European Commission on these negotiations, which prevented the United States from applying ‘carousel’ sanctions in 2009 to increase the number of products subjected to higher tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we support the commitment that the European Union has obtained, which ensures protection for European consumers and enables us to normalise trade relations with the United States and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations of this kind are a good example of how conflicts may be resolved. We have been talking about beef imports from the United States. There has not been an outbreak of spongiform encephalitis for some time and we are now free of risk. Therefore, we should ensure that we resolve long-standing and hitherto insuperable problems through this type of agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I suppose, from the EU perspective, it is not good to hear this, but this is what they are saying to us and therefore they will need more clarity on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, I would be somewhat concerned that without that clarity, we will not see the movement on EU beef exports to the USA. So yes, we have achieved a great deal and we have broken the deadlock on a trade war, but I think we need to do a great deal more for both sides to benefit from this solution.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point, and I will repeat it, is on the issue of practical regulations. I know in this House we have concerns sometimes around how detailed and complex and bureaucratic our regulations are. It would be unfortunate if the US is saying to us, and it is from what I hear, that our regulations on this issue are far too impractical. So perhaps the Commissioner would refer to that and perhaps also to concerns around Russia and their proposal to ban livestock exports because of the Schmallenberg virus? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU will be able to obtain compliance with the animal protection rules for beef, the cause of the dispute for the last 13 years, while the US will gradually allow certain categories of European products to be imported, especially traditional ones. The first products entered in the relevant European database also included a product from Romania, Topoloveni jam.</p>

That is not always the case. Sometimes, the situation gets worse the longer you wait. However, here we can work on the assumption that the long negotiations and the long struggle have ultimately paid off. The major conflicts with the United States over our exports and their exports in these areas have lasted for 10 to 15 years and that is a long time. For this reason, I believe that the solution is a good one. We now have fewer problems exporting some products to the US that we previously could not export at all or only with great difficulty. We are importing high-quality beef and the quotas for this have been increased. I do not know whether it is absolutely necessary to bring high-quality beef into Europe, because we have our own, but in negotiations, both parties always have to make concessions. That is what has happened in this case. I believe that the end result will be a good one. Ms McGuinness is right in saying that we must, of course, monitor very closely what happens in the future, but we can ultimately be satisfied with what we have achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As some of you have mentioned, so that it can be said that both sides are happy, the issue of BSE must also be finalised on the US side.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened on 9 March was a step in the right direction. Ms McGuinness mentioned the question of treatment with lactic acid. The European Commission has said several times – in fact, at every opportunity when dealing with the United States – that this issue of lactic acid has to be dealt with scientifically, rather than as a bargaining chip.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way that we are also asking for the issue of BSE to be treated in a scientific manner. When there is scientific proof that we have this disease under control, this measure should not be used as a non-tariff barrier. As regards lactic acid, this is the method that the European Commission has chosen to handle this issue. The EFSA has carried out scientific studies on the treatment of carcasses with lactic acid. The European Commission will come to a position on the basis of the scientific analysis and I hope that this issue is not going to hold up the United States’ decision on BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the most practical regulation for the quota system, some might find it is not perfect but, unfortunately, we do not have a perfect system. We are actually in the process of analysing, in the wake of complaints from various importers, how these systems can be improved for greater transparency and predictability. Here too, however, we are restricted by the methods with which we are familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Băsescu, as regards the geographical indication quality system, we are still in negotiations with the United States to reach a mutual recognition of geographical indication quality systems, other than for alcoholic beverages and wine, for which we have the elements of a specific agreement. However, we are also hoping to achieve recognition for this geographical indication system at the World Trade Organisation. Moreover, with some countries, some large countries like China, for example, but also with others, we always deal with the issue of recognition of geographical indication systems in bilateral agreements. We are also hoping to make progress with the United States on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A good sign that things are moving forward is the recently concluded agreement on the mutual recognition of our certification systems for organic products. European products can now be exported to the US market with a European organic certification, and this is also the case for US products on the European market. This shows that negotiations and agricultural and food industry diplomacy can also produce good results.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks once again to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl for the reports and thanks also to the European Parliament for showing once again that the codecision system not only gives legitimacy to the decisions taken at European level, but it also allows it to be done quickly and effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> My report not only concerns high-quality beef, but is also a clear indication that many of the relationships between the US and the EU, which have recently become rather bogged down and have not looked very optimistic, could begin to improve.

<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point and I believe, on the basis of many years’ experience of Parliament, that it should not be taken for granted.

At the same time, the resolution of the European Parliament of 8 March 2011 must be respected, which called for an end to the sanctions imposed by the US and Canada on products originating from the EU and the provision of clear guarantees regarding beef imports which need to come into line with the food safety requirements stipulated by European legislation. In this respect, I welcome the proposal that the European executive can suspend the EU’s annual tariff quota if the agreement is not implemented or maintained by the US and Canada. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After many years of negotiation, mutual export restrictions, sanctions and retaliatory customs duties, there is a chance that this dispute might finally end, and that it might end to the benefit of both parties. The United States and Canada have suspended all sanctions imposed on agricultural products from the EU in return for zero duty on an increased tariff quota of high-quality beef containing no growth hormone (which was the reason for the ban on imports into the EU). It only remains for us to meet the agreed deadlines, in other words, to approve the second stage of the agreement, so that it can enter into force on 1 August of this year. I fully support the rapporteur’s position and advocate a favourable opinion of the European Parliament on this issue. The agreement will have a very favourable effect on transatlantic economic and political relations with our major trading partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
