Noise is an environmental and health problem which is underestimated. Tyres cause a nuisance to one third of the citizens in Europe who complain about it, compared to one quarter of the citizens ten years ago. The problem of noise is therefore escalating, especially road and aircraft noise. At first reading, the European Parliament was wrong not to react to the feeble proposals from the European Commission. For example, the European Commission’s proposal did not contain a review clause. All environmental proposals made by the European Commission contain a review clause, but not this one. This is hardly surprising given the fact that this proposal was drafted by the DG for Industry. In the Council, this environmental matter was wrongly dealt with by the Ministers for Economic Affairs and the Internal Market. It should have been dealt with in the Council of Ministers for the Environment. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has tabled 4 amendments with 32 votes against 10 votes. With regard to ordinary passenger cars, we suggest that the limit is reduced by 2 decibels. The German independent inspection body, TÜV, has tested numerous existing car tyres. They all meet the ineffective noise limits proposed by the Council. A reduction of 2 decibels is technically possible without jeopardising safety. This has also been confirmed by experts of the Swedish institute for roads and traffic. With regard to vans and lorries, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection also suggests reducing the noise level by 2 decibels. Vans and lorries produce more noise than ordinary cars. This is why it is important to make the necessary changes here too, and I hope that a number of the Christian-Democrat MEPs will be able to vote in favour of this. The tyre industry has been given until October 2005 to meet stricter noise limits. This seems ample time to me. More is required, of course, in order to reduce the noise from road traffic. The noise level from ‘fluisterasfalt’ [silent asphalt], as it is termed by our Flemish friends, or ‘ZOAB, zeer open asfaltbeton’ [very open asphalt concrete], as we like to refer to it in the Netherlands, is probably 20 decibels lower than that from cobblestone roads. Our motorways are no longer paved with cobblestones, but a reduction of 3 to 5 decibels is possible by introducing this type of asphalt everywhere. We will be returning to the problems of noise when we deal with the directive on noise. Silent asphalt and a change of tyre could help reduce the noise level by 6 decibels, which may not seem a great deal, but one should remember that decibels are a logarithmic table. This means that the noise level can be cut by more than half without reducing the volume of traffic. Cars inherently cause a large number of environmental problems. More than 10 years ago, the European Parliament introduced the first generation of catalytic converters and, two years ago, the second generation of catalytic converters appeared in the Langen/Hautala report on the motor oil programme. As a result, air pollution caused by cars and lorries will drop by 70% to 90% in 2005 and 2007. Similarly, we found a sound solution to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles in the Florenz report. There are now two major environmental issues left to tackle at European level. The first one is noise, which I have dealt with extensively, and the second one is the CO2 or the greenhouse problem. With regard to CO2, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has suggested that the European Commission submit a legislative proposal to reduce the rolling resistance of tyres by 5%. This means that 5% less fuel will be used and that the emission of CO2 will also fall by the same amount. I would welcome a positive reaction from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am no lawyer and am not in a position to judge. What is true is that insufficient account has so far been taken of environmental interests. Just in the last three days, the car and tyre industries have indicated in this Chamber that their options may well be open when it comes specifically to car tyres.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is not at present overly concerned about whether the figure is to be 1, 3 or 4 decibels, but we should like to make it clear that we want positively to force the tyre industry to act and do more of what is required of them in this area. The motor oil, car and recycling industries have made a lot of things possible where road use by individuals is concerned. In contrast, the tyre industry has largely refrained from taking action. It is in this area that we want them to do some catching up. We shall doubtless at some stage also have to talk about alternative road surfaces in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a positive way of forcing the tyre industry to act. I should therefore like straight away to forestall some of my fellow MEPs who now and again stand up jokingly and say that Mr Florenz wants a reduction of two decibels where possible but is accepting a 10 metres longer braking distance in return. Obviously, we want to maintain standards. We expect innovation. We expect the tyre industry to employ young engineers of both sexes and finally to go some way towards meeting people’s justified demands to be exposed to less noise in their homes. That is a task we have set ourselves, and I hope that the Commission will be prepared to cooperate. It is possible, as we shall see in one or two years’ time, that the industry will be able to achieve these objectives of ours by the year 2005. If that were not possible, I am the very first to concede that we need to broaden our field of operations somewhat. But the industry must be forced to act, and that is what we shall be campaigning for at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would therefore be a jolly good idea if, merely by being fitted with new tyres, our own cars were to cause 40% less noise and, at the same time, use 5% less fuel and also emit less CO2. This is the road we should be going down.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already tyres whose specifications are well below the values proposed in the common position when it comes both to tyre noise and to the rolling resistance which is responsible for petrol consumption and CO2 emissions. There are even tyres to which the Federal Republic of Germany awards a Blue Angel as a sign of environmental friendliness because they are a model of quiet operation and give rise to low petrol consumption. Now, these tyres are not particularly unsafe. On the contrary. Michelin and Dunlop tyres even make for shorter braking distances while remaining quiet and preserving fuel economy. I am therefore wondering why this Parliament cannot summon up the courage to say that whatever is now already state of the art technology is what we demand by 2005 for all tyres, particularly those fitted to private cars.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like strongly to request that we adopt Amendment No 1, through which we call for limit values not only for tyre noise but also for rolling resistance, and that we adopt, in particular, Amendment No 2 in connection with quieter tyres. I would ask you to consider that this does not yet mean the end of the negotiations. We are entering into the negotiations in the Conciliation Committee with the Council, and we shall then see what emerges. However, we must also have room for manoeuvre. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are bringing forward far too much legislation and, with legislation, quality is usually in inverse proportion to quantity. We talk of doing less and doing it better. In fact we do more, and we do it worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Now turning to tyres. I little thought when I came to this House that I would end up defending the Commission's position – and yet the Commission has done its homework. It has consulted with the industry. It has come up with a proposal that sets challenging, but achievable, targets which protect the environment whilst also recognising the interests of road users and tyre makers.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our colleagues are seeking to sabotage this careful work by demanding arbitrary and ill-considered decibel reductions. In some cases their figures are achievable, in others not. But they have forgotten that changes in the production specifications of tyres affect not only noise, but also grip, safety, fuel economy, cost and durability. They may end up with quieter tyres that are expensive, that wear out quickly and that allow cars to slide off the road and crash into trees!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me speak plainly. More road users will die if Mr de Roo's amendments are passed. The electors I represent will not thank us. We are being far too prescriptive. It is our job to set a broad legislative framework in the public interest. Instead, we seek to micro-manage a highly technical and complex industrial development programme, a task for which we have neither the time nor the skills. I call on colleagues to reject the amendments and support the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is long overdue. Certainly the amendments to it by my colleagues Mr de Roo and Mr Lange are moving in the right direction. Since the first publication of this directive back in 1997 the manufacturers have moved to meet the Commission standards. I understand the desire of my colleague, Mr de Roo, to take the standards further. However, I have to sound a note of caution.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, tyre standards are not the only problem. The nature of the road surface is just as important and in particular circumstances like noise hotspots in urban areas perhaps more important than trying to change the tyre standards. In many cases a better solution is to change the road surface and not the tyre standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and in my opinion of paramount importance – is the need to balance the problem of tyre noise and tyre safety. Whilst we are tonight seeking to adopt new tyre standards to reduce tyre noise we are not making any progress at all on tyre standards for the grip or adhesion of tyres on the road. Despite good and serious proposals being put on the table some considerable time ago by the UK, they have not yet been agreed or seriously considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Our failure to agree tyre safety standards creates an unacceptable level of uncertainty with regard to this vital question. For that reason I am particularly concerned about the potential effects of Amendments Nos 3 and 4 and their impact upon tyre safety, especially for vehicles such as buses and trucks. In the circumstances I feel bound to say that I personally cannot give my support to Mr de Roo's Amendments Nos 3 and 4. I suggest to him that they are premature and I would ask the Commission to reject them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reduction of any kind of noise is important both for people’s health and their comfort. For that reason, I feel very positive about the Council’s common position with regard to tyre noise. I am by no means acting as spokesman here for the tyre industry, but, having watched that industry very closely, I nevertheless wish to express my concern about the effect the amendments will have.</p>
<p class="contents">The tyre industry is a very fiercely competitive industry, and one that is competitive on a global scale. It is responsible for some very thorough development work and, owing to the nature of tyre technology, it is progressing slowly but surely. The situation will become untenable, however, if there is an attempt to bring in changes too fast, as would seem to be the case on this occasion. If things move too quickly it will mean immense technical problems for the industry, with unnecessary extra costs, which will be reflected in the prices of the products. The consumer is always the one that has to pay. An adequate transition period, however, will guarantee that the new requirements are taken account of at the development stage. Any other course of action would be a waste of resources, because it would take on average three to four years to develop a new tyre model.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue becomes especially problematic when we consider that a tyre is a very delicate product in terms of balancing its individual properties. It is not really just black and round, as the layman thinks. When one property of the tyre is improved, it affects the others adversely, so tyre design is really a question of optimising compromises. For example, a broad tyre holds well on asphalt, but tends to start skimming over water easily. On the other hand, a narrow tyre works well on snow. If a tyre’s noise properties were to be essentially improved it would above all impair its ability to hold the road in wet conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I want my fellowmen to drive on safe tyres, above all. I wish the tyre industry and the EU legislators would get together and draw up a realistic timetable for the excellent objectives outlined in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the aim of this proposal for a directive is to limit tyre/road noise without sacrificing grip and therefore road-holding and braking safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing the proposal, the Commission consulted several bodies independent from the manufacturers, who worked with experts from the Member States for a long time in order to find the appropriate level of strictness on decibels for the various categories of tyres for cars, vans and lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this extensive prior consultation of experts, the Member States have unanimously approved the level of strictness chosen in the proposal as a common position. The European Parliament itself showed its satisfaction with the level of strictness of the proposal and did not table any amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it should be noted that the quality of the road surface is, to a great extent, up to 6 decibels, responsible for the noise generated by tyre contact. It should also be made clear that the Commission is continuing with the measures launched two years ago to combat the various sources of noise, covering every sector of activity of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, at the second reading, 4 amendments have been tabled. Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4 propose the reduction of noise thresholds by 2 decibels. If this reduction of 2 decibels were implemented today, more than 70% of tyres currently on the market would not pass the test. Manufacturers would therefore be obliged to urgently modify the structure of the tyre and the hardness of the rubber by reducing the grip. Until grip requirements are applied, these three amendments are therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This correlation between noise and rolling, tyre grip and fuel consumption is rightly at the centre of the concern expressed in Amendment No 1. This concern is currently the subject of the search for a consensus in a working party for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, a working party monitored by the staff of the European Commission. This matter is also the subject of discussion in the <span class="italic">Transatlantic Business Dialogue </span>to promote the emergence of a <span class="italic">Global Type Standard</span> GTS 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is following this work with the intention of transposing the results into Directive 92/23/EEC in order to determine the correct balance between safety, noise and resistance. Unfortunately, however, the proposed timetable is too strict. The wide range of products covered and the problem in all its complexity must be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons that Article 3, as worded in the common position, stipulates that the requirements on grip and on rolling resistance shall be integrated with the noise requirements in the extended timetable of 24 and 36 months respectively, following the entry into force of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1, which proposes to legislate again on two occasions within a period of one year after the entry into force of this directive, is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the complexity of the methods of measuring grip on dry and wet surfaces and rolling resistance and due to the wide range of products, the results of the experts' work will not be available before 2002. The Commission will then be able to amend this directive in order to include grip on dry and wet surfaces and rolling resistance for all categories of tyre. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
