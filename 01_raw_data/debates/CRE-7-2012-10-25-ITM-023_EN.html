The overall assessment, in this case at least, is overwhelmingly positive. As I recall, the European Ombudsman’s powers are conferred by Article 298 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and his main function within the network of European ombudsmen is to guarantee respect for the right of citizens to good administration and also, in particular, respect for the rights guaranteed by Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which states that every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This year – and let us be clear that I am talking about 2011 – the European Ombudsman registered fewer complaints than in 2010; the total number fell from 2 667 to 2 510. What was new about these complaints is that more than 61 %, just over 61 % of these complaints were submitted using the internet. Of these 61 %, 53 % were submitted by citizens using the form on the European Ombudsman’s web portal. This fact is very dear to my heart as Chair of the Committee on Petitions, which for some time now has been asking for an internet service and web portal that are better tailored to citizens’ petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of requests for information and clarifications fell significantly in 2011, and we all agree that this is because of the excellent guide produced by the European Ombudsman, which has succeeded in cutting the number of these requests for information. The number of petitions erroneously submitted to the European Ombudsman also fell, and by this I mean the number of petitions incorrectly sent to the Ombudsman because they were outside his mandate. This is certainly also due to two other information sources used and produced by the European Ombudsman’s office to help and facilitate the process for citizens. The Ombudsman also changed some procedures in 2011 to make them simpler. This work and these best practices introduced by the Ombudsman have undoubtedly had a positive impact on the results of the services that he provides.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of the total number of petitions presented by citizens, we should point out that the number of complaints against the European Commission is still quite high, and accounts for the largest share of all complaints, at 58 %. In the Commission’s defence, it should be explained that, because the Commission has executive powers, for citizens it is the most easily identifiable target, but this does not completely exonerate it from blame and Commissioner Šefčovič will, I am sure, have something to add on this matter. It is nice to know that Parliament, on the other hand, has reduced by almost half the number of complaints against it, while the number of complaints against the Council is rising. Most of the inquiries opened by the Ombudsman were completed (of 382 opened, 318 were completed) and I think that is an excellent performance.</p>
<p class="contents">My closing comment is that there is one flaw in this activity, and it is this: like all institutional persons involved in the protection of citizens’ rights, who have no actual powers for making sure citizens’ complaints are resolved, the Ombudsman’s procedures can conclude with a recommendation or in serious cases with a critical remark, but they cannot provide citizens with a direct solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank you for this opportunity to address you on the subject of my annual report for the year 2011. I would like first of all to say that I am grateful to Parliament’s continued support for the work of the European Ombudsman. I wish also to express my sincere thanks to the Chair of the Committee on Petitions, Ms Mazzoni, for her thorough and insightful report on my activities, to which we just listened. As I have repeatedly stated, the support of Parliament and the collaboration of the Petitions Committee are essential contributors to the success of the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the key statistics of the annual report. During 2011 I received a total of 2 510 complaints from citizens, companies, NGOs, associations and others. I try to help every complainant who turns to the Ombudsman, even in cases when the complaint is not within my mandate. We should not underestimate how important it is for citizens to be guided to the most appropriate complaint-handling mechanism and body from the outset and to be spared the frustrations and delays associated with having to identify the right institution on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2009 I launched an interactive guide on my website which is accessible in all 23 official languages. This guide aims to direct complainants to the body best placed to help them, be it my own services, the Petitions Committee of Parliament, the services of national original ombudsmen in the Member States, or existing problem-solving mechanisms established by the European Commission such as the ‘Your Europe’ portal or the Solvit network for cross-border problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of inadmissible complaints submitted to me continued to decline in 2011, this time by 111. In large part, I attribute this decline to the fact that, by using the interactive guide, more citizens are finding the right address to turn to the first time round. In 2011, more than 18 000 people received advice through the guide. Counting the number of requests for information replied to, and complaints that were dealt with, we can say that over 22 000 citizens were directly helped by the Ombudsman in 2011. Furthermore, the Ombudsman’s website received over 295 000 unique visitors.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the reduction in the number of complaints outside my mandate, the number of inquiries opened in 2011 rose to 396, that is, showed an increase of 18 % (one-eight). This strength confirms that, increasingly, the people turning to the European Ombudsman are doing so for the right reasons. The large increase in inquiries opened is also a result of changes I have effected to my own procedures to make them more citizen-friendly. A new type of inquiry was introduced this past year to allow complainants to clarify their complaints in cases where I am not initially convinced that there are grounds to ask an EU institution for its opinion on the case.</p>
<p class="contents">A sustained reduction in critical remarks issued by my office is further positive evidence that the EU institutions are positively responding to my recommendations and that they are taking a more proactive role in resolving complaints and in enabling win-win outcomes. This is obviously always preferable to the complainant and the institution concerned. Over the last three years the number of critical remarks has averaged just above 34, whereas the average was just above 46 in the period 2006-2008.</p>
<p class="contents">This year I have again included in the annual report the category of ‘star cases’ in order to highlight illustrative examples of exemplary administrative practice by institutions and bodies revealed through my inquiries and, in addition, to emphasise that a central function of the Ombudsman institution is to strengthen and deepen a culture of service in the EU institutions and bodies by promoting and supporting best practice. Ten such star cases are highlighted in this year’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions’ willingness to cooperate with the Ombudsman to achieve a satisfactory resolution to complaints constitutes an important expression of their commitment to this culture of service. I also note that, in some of the cases, the constructive engagement of the complainants themselves also proved crucial to obtaining a win-win outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">According to a special Eurobarometer survey on citizens’ rights and on the performance of the EU administration, which was commissioned by the Parliament and the Ombudsman and was published during 2011, the right to move and reside freely in the EU is considered to be the most important citizen’s right (48 % of respondents). The second most important right is the right to good administration (33 %) followed by the right to complain to the Ombudsman (32 %). On the other hand, 42 % of respondents indicated that they are not satisfied with transparency in the EU administration, and 52 % said that the Ombudsman should ensure that citizens know their rights and how to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">Making a priority of the policy goal of informing citizens, in March 2011 I held the biggest stakeholder event ever organised by the Ombudsman, which was entitled ‘Is the Lisbon Treaty delivering for citizens?’ Major speakers in this event included the President of the European Council, Mr Herman Van Rompuy, the then Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mrs Diana Wallis, and the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs Viviane Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">I also published, in 2011, a booklet entitled ‘Problems with the EU? Who can help you?’ This new publication provides information on a whole range of problem-solving mechanisms available to individuals who face problems with the EU. I note that the demand for this booklet has been higher than for any other publication in the entire history of the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the level of dissatisfaction with transparency in the EU, I used the occasion provided by the celebration of ‘International Right to Know Day’ on 28 September to call upon the EU administration to be more proactive as regards transparency. In that context I called on the EU institutions to adopt useful, citizen-friendly online registers of documents. Furthermore, as regards my own services, in early 2011 I began publishing, on my website, information on new inquiries as soon as they are opened. This new practice makes it easier for citizens to follow the progress of inquiries right from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009 I adopted a mission statement for the European Ombudsman institution which reads as follows: the European Ombudsman seeks fair outcomes to complaints against European Union institutions, encourages transparency and promotes an administrative culture of service. He aims to build trust through dialogue between citizens and the European Union and to foster the highest standards of behaviour in the Union’s institutions. In order best to implement this mission statement, in 2010 I developed and adopted a strategy for the institution which forms the basis of my initiatives and activities during my current mandate as Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Key points of this strategy include: first, strengthening the ongoing dialogue with complainants, civil society and other stakeholders in line with central commitments enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon; second, identifying best practices from Ombudsman colleagues through, amongst others, cooperation in the European network of ombudsmen; and third, enhancing the Ombudsman’s role in promoting an administrative culture of service in the EU institutions. In order consistently to deliver good administration – a key component of being citizen-friendly – institutions and bodies need to nourish and nurture a culture of service to citizens. A body which seeks to promote such a culture of service will encourage the members of its staff not only to respect good administration as a legal right but also to be polite, helpful and cooperative in dealing with citizens, willing to explain their activities and the reasoning behind decisions taken and ready to accept public scrutiny of their conduct. With these considerations in mind, I concluded that it would be useful to produce a concise statement of these and other public service principles which could help promote citizens’ trust in the European civil service and the EU institutions. The Public Service Principles were published on 19 June this year and are contained in a very small leaflet, which is this one. Allow me to mention them briefly. One: commitment to the European Union and its citizens; two: integrity; three: objectivity; four: respect for others; five: transparency. I am grateful to DG Personnel for having distributed the principles to everyone working within Parliament on 4 October.</p>
<p class="contents">President, honourable Members, as I have repeatedly indicated, this statement of pubic service principles is neither the first nor the last word about the ethical standards that apply to the EU civil service. As the submissions to the public consultation made clear, the Staff Regulations, the Financial Regulation and the Ombudsman’s widely-adopted European code of good administrative behaviour already embody such standards, both explicitly and implicitly.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the idea of producing a statement of pubic service principles was not to develop new ethical standards but rather to make clear the expectations of both civil servants and citizens for making an everyday reality of the ethical standards to which the EU public administration already adheres. The added value of making the standards explicit is to help generate and focus a continuous, constructive discussion among civil servants and between civil servants and the public about what behaviour is ethically appropriate. The public consultation demonstrated the value of such a debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles do not seek to duplicate existing instruments or to be a substitute for revisiting, revising and supplementing those instruments where that may be necessary. Rather I expect them to be a rich source of ideas on which I will draw in working with the institutions of the EU in the future to encourage and nurture the institutional culture that makes the principles a living reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate her and the Committee on Petitions on this very important piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Ombudsman reported himself, it offers a clear and exhaustive overview of the Ombudsman’s activities for the past year and represents a very useful tool for the other institutions as well. Both reports remind us very clearly of our common goal, which is to ensure open, efficient and independent European administration for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Mr Diamandouros personally for his excellent cooperation and for his assistance in enabling us to do our job better. His insights and suggestions are always very welcome, and I appreciate the very fruitful contact on a political and also on a service level.</p>
<p class="contents">Several figures have been offered and proposed by Mrs Mazzoni and also by Mr Diamandouros, but allow me also to bring in some of our own. The fact is that the Ombudsman’s enquiries continue to be focused mostly on the European Commission, of which they represented 58 % in 2011, which is a little bit less than in 2010, when the figure was 65 %. I also agree with the conclusions of Mrs Mazzoni’s report that to a great extent it is natural for the European Commission to be the principal addressee of the enquiries as it is the biggest institution, with executive powers. How have the complaints and cases been handled by the European Ombudsman? The European Commission had 365 replies to the Ombudsman in 2011 in comparison with 375 in 2010. We are very much aware of the importance of friendly solutions and we strive to achieve, if possible, a win-win situation. Both reports conclude that there was a positive upward trend in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />We would also like to note that the number of critical remarks received by the Commission has steadily decreased since 2007. In 2011 they represented 11 % of all the enquiries closed. It is very important to mention that in 2011 the Commission sent 25 replies to the European Ombudsman’s critical remarks, and the Commission totally or partially agreed with the Ombudsman in 18 cases, which represents a considerable share of the total – 72 %.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this, the number of informal procedures handled in 2011 was 99, which is also a substantial increase compared to previous years. In such cases the Ombudsman asks the Commission to reply directly to citizens without analysing the substance of the reply.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Ombudsman for holding conferences and for organising very broad public consultations on public service principles, to which we also contributed through the written contribution of the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like also to confirm that we value and apply those principles. Even if the Staff Regulations already impose the strongest of rules for EU officials and the Commission is committed to the highest ethical values which guide its administration in contacts with the public and respects the code of good administrative conduct, we will also apply these principles across the Commission. They have been distributed to all our officials and have been posted on our internal and external websites.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by stressing once again that the Commission looks forward very much to continuing the useful and very fruitful cooperation with the Ombudsman, Parliament and the Petitions Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figures you quote in your annual report send a clear message: in 2011, 2 510 complaints were registered and 2 544 were processed. It was striking for me to see the relatively small number of inadmissible complaints, since in the Committee on Petitions we are attempting to improve that ratio. Congratulations on these figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures prove to me that the institution of European Ombudsman is an important building block of transparency and democratic control in the European Union. The European Ombudsman provides people in the European Union with someone to turn to if they feel unfairly treated by the European institutions, thereby making a significant contribution to making Europe more tangible and intelligible for our citizens. We must also make it clear that the European Ombudsman is no paper tiger: he asks tough questions and does not soften his stance, even if the process takes longer. I would not go so far as to say that the Commission quakes in its boots before the European Ombudsman, but there is mutual respect. This is a good way of working that can be further cultivated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am especially pleased that the cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman is so smooth. As is stated, the right of petition and the right to complain to the Ombudsman are complementary instruments. Normally – as we know in politics – complementary instruments can cause disputes over jurisdictions. The Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have no such disputes. You could say that our joint working motto could read: if in doubt, support the citizens of the European Union – and a good job, too!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Diamandouros, I hope that we can continue this good work together – naturally, nothing is so good that it cannot be improved – and to that end, my best wishes for our cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is rare to have such support and recognition from the Commission, which is one of the favourite targets of your investigations.

<p class="contents">Finally, our report says something which must concern us, Commissioner Šefčovič: 58 % of inquiries concern the European Commission. Furthermore, in 2012 there are still cases, including in the Committee on Petitions, which allege a lack of transparency and a lack of cooperation on the part of the European Commission in its dealings with European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish you success, Mr Diamandouros, and I hope you will have the same success in your efforts to persuade the national ombudsmen that they too have a fundamental duty to ensure that the Member States serve their own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Your office has published principles of good administration, for which we thank you; but at the same time it is, regrettably, necessary to rap the Commission’s knuckles. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, principles of good administration should have been drawn up for EU citizens, but unfortunately the Commission has failed to issue any such proposal. It is good that the Ombudsman has done so; however, these are principles, and are not binding in the way that a law on good administration would be.</p>
<p class="contents">I still hope that the Commission will issue a proposal on good administration before its work comes to an end, and that it will likewise issue a proposal on transparency. This proposal on increasing transparency that you requested in fact reduces transparency, or would have reduced transparency if it had entered into force. This is disgraceful. In the 2010s, the rules of transparency are different from what they were 10-20 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group I would ask the Commission to produce a law on good administration for Parliament and the Council in this matter, and also to improve transparency and to issue a new regulation on increased transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, it is natural that we should have a regulation. In connection with this, I would also once again like to express my thanks for the fact that the report provides clear support, which is also very apparent in Mr Diamandouros’s review here: that what must be introduced now is the so-called service principle or the ‘culture of service’, where the considerations of citizens are at the centre and where citizens are not considered opponents against which protection must be sought, but rather as people who should be served. A little more often than I would like, I have encountered a culture within the Commission where citizens are the enemy, and we must get away from that. I was glad that Mr Šefčovič said a few well-chosen words about this; however, we cannot live off words alone; we want action. I would also like to emphasise in connection with this that having competent officials with self-respect is absolutely the best way because it gives us one of the best ways of tackling corruption, for corruption is closely linked to corrupt administrations, and these administrations must be lifted up towards self-respect, openness, transparency and a good culture. We must have a good regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to use my final minutes to consider another matter: We have discussed the very high number of complaints for some countries compared with others. We see the same thing in the Committee on Petitions. Allow me to now say: I think we should interpret this as a good sign if a country has active citizens who participate and come to us. It is not necessarily a sign that there is something very wrong in the society concerned; on the contrary, we could praise the society and say: ‘Look! Here is a strong civil society! We will support this!’ Therefore, it is not just a question of coming forward with complaints; on the contrary: let us help each other. Thank you, Mr President!

<p class="contents">It is true that you are going to have a great deal of work to do and we should all help to bring the institutions closer to the public and resolve the problems, because all the complaints that you are going to receive are going to relate to the current European production model, which is entirely unsupportive and unsustainable. As a result, millions of people are suffering pain and humiliation, do not have jobs, are falling into poverty and are having their homes taken from them. There is no doubt that in this type of crisis we all need to make a contribution towards being much more diligent and urging the Commission to be more transparent, so that swift responses can be given to those who are having a very difficult time across the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Praise is due to Mr Diamandouros, who worthily represents and serves an institution that contributes to the qualitative improvement of EU administration and the safeguarding of European citizens’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Ombudsman’s report, 2 510 petitions were registered in 2011, and the institution directly assisted more than 22 000 citizens. This is an excellent record, but I think this important institution should, in an appropriate way, be made more widely known to EU citizens, bearing in mind that 42 % of European citizens, according to a Eurobarometer report, are not satisfied with transparency in the EU administration. This is a necessary institution and its operation has so far been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">As happens every year, of course, most of the inquiries conducted by the Ombudsman concerned the European Commission – about 58 % – and it is especially important that suitable measures should be designed to strengthen cooperation with the Commission in the interests of European citizens. Particularly in this difficult time of crisis for institutions and democratic values, I congratulate Mr Diamandouros on the excellent way in which he is performing his duties, just as I congratulate Ms Mazzoni, Chair of the Committee on Petitions, who facilitates good cooperation between the two bodies. I will also take this opportunity to sound an optimistic note and say that the crisis will pass. We need to restore citizens’ confidence in institutions and in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Becker (PPE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Ombudsman, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Ms Mazzoni shows that we should thank the Ombudsman for his work in the service of European citizens and for his cooperation with the European Parliament, especially the Committee on Petitions. I can point to a very precise example, which has struck me: in addition to about 1 800 ongoing petitions, in the Committee on Petitions we have to produce a special report regarding complaints against the Commission. I have established that, in the last 16 years, this very special instrument has been used only 18 times. This proves how accurately and objectively the Ombudsman and his team carry out their work. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to point out two aspects I have noticed along the way. The first relates to the publicity work for the work of the Ombudsman, which could do with a boost. It seems to me that the 27 % of petitions processed that actually fell within his jurisdiction indicate, if we revert the argument, that almost three quarters of the petitions do not, and that it would be worthwhile raising people’s awareness here. On that point, in Austria the Ombudsmen broadcast on public television.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, regarding which I would be happy if in the next report progress were to be announced, is the Regulation on General Administrative Procedures. I would be happy to see binding minimum standards applied to the entire administration of the EU. I know that the Ombudsman is very active in this area. My best wishes for our – and especially his – continued, successful work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am appealing to him in future to watch over the best possible utilisation of funds, and to work with other EU institutions. I fully support the Ombudsman’s view that the principles of good administration go further than the law and require the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies not only to respect their legal obligations, but also to be service-minded and to ensure that members of the public are properly treated and enjoy their rights fully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we look at the statistics we see that the number of complaints is going down. I would also like to assure you that good administrative behaviour and respect for these very important principles is something which is very important to us and is part of our everyday work.</p>
<p class="contents">There were a lot of comments concerning the transparency of the Commission. I agree with you that we can always do better, and I am sure that we will do better next year than we have this year. But I am still convinced that the European civil service and the European Commission is one of the most transparent public administrations you can find in Europe and in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we going to improve our quality of work? We will continue with very intense internal training of our officials. We will be constantly increasing awareness of the importance of respect for the principles of good administrative behaviour and transparency. We are increasing the use of informal procedures, which very often help us to find amicable solutions without an unnecessary bureaucratic burden. We are looking harder for amicable solutions, and here we get very good advice from the Ombudsman. Good cooperation with you and with the good offices of the Ombudsman helps us to improve our work in this particular respect.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the area of transparency, here also over the course of the last couple of years a considerable effort has been made, and I think that together we have accomplished a great deal. For example, our joint transparency register is something which is not often found in the capitals of different countries in the world. I think there is something comparable in Washington, and now we have something similar in Vienna. We can see how this transparency register is working and attracting more and more companies to be registered.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that I would need the support of Parliament and of civil society to encourage the participation of, for example, law firms. We will very soon see how we want to tackle this issue in the report which we are preparing in which we will assess how the transparency register works. We are much more transparent than before with regard to the comitology register, showing how the expert groups are composed, their agendas and the results of their deliberations. We publish the minutes of their discussions, and this also compares very well with similar situations in most of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the statistic produced by Eurobarometer is a very correct one, showing the importance of transparency and how European citizens are very often disappointed. But at the same time we should also be also proud – both Parliament and the Commission – that we are among the most trusted institutions in the European Union. If we compare, in this time of crisis, how many citizens trust the EU, the European Parliament and the Commission, I think that the percentage in many cases would be quite significantly higher than for trust in the national institutions. This is something which has to be remembered as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the situation of Mr Dalli – and I am sure that the Ombudsman will respond to specific questions – I would just like to reassure all of you that in the conclusions of the OLAF investigations it was very clear that his services were cleared by the OLAF report. There was no impact whatsoever on the good functioning and efficient handling of the files by the DGs. This also applies to the Tobacco Directive. I would also like to reassure you, as I did two days ago, that the Tobacco Directive will be proposed without any delay. I hope that the hearing for the new Commissioner is now some two or three weeks away. I would like to assure this House that the Tobacco Directive will be ruled on by this Parliament in the current electoral period. I believe that, after we submit the proposal to you, you will all agree that it is a very ambitious one which is very important for the health of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are profoundly appreciative of your support and are cognisant of the fact that your support and your good work increase the responsibilities that lie on our shoulders to be able to continue to do things better and work together with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament with a view to serving citizens even better. I am very grateful for that and for your encouragement.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of MEPs raised the question of the low number of complainants and the high number of inadmissibles – Mr Jahr, Mr Becker and Mr Wałęsa. I think the important point to repeat again is that, because of the interactive guide we introduced three years ago on our website, we have now had the good result of people coming to us for the right reasons rather than the wrong reasons. This Parliament had for years been insisting that we should try to bring down the number of inadmissibles. We have done it. We have done it very significantly. I just want to say that in fact this is one of the things for which we are grateful to Parliament for suggesting that we do.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Boştinaru, I want to thank you very much for your comments and your support. As you know, the ‘déformation professionnelle’ of the Ombudsman is to try to be fair, and in all fairness it is important for me to say that it is indeed the case that the Commission has the largest number of complaints – as the Commissioner said, it also accounts for 65 % of all EU civil servants – but, if you look at the star cases that the Ombudsman produced last year (ten in all), five star cases for exemplary performance went to the Commission. So we do have problems where we criticise the Commission, and we work with the Commissioner to be able to rectify maladministration, but we also have to acknowledge the areas where they actually do try, and they do very good work there.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Auken, I am very grateful to you. You know where I stand on the issue of the regulation. I was in Mrs Jäätteenmäki’s home country and in your home country only two weeks ago and I had occasion to speak with Mrs Astola of the Finnish Ministry of Justice precisely about how we can promote this kind of regulation on EU administrative law and how to serve citizens better.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mrs Prendergast first of all on the decision of her own Parliament in Ireland yesterday significantly to expand the mandate of the Irish Ombudsman and to add 140 new bodies to her remit. This was a long-overdue reform and I can only applaud it, as a colleague, and convey, through you, our happiness that this is the case. Concerning your question, Mrs Prendergast, on the Tobacco Directive, the answer is that the European Ombudsman, to date, has not received any complaint concerning the directive. If we were to receive a complaint, of course we would have to ensure that before coming to us the complainants had addressed OLAF as the appropriate body for ensuring that the appropriate measures had been complied with – or any other kind of EU institution that might be involved, in this particular case the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like once again to acknowledge Commissioner Šefčovič’s continuing offer regarding good administration. We take it very seriously, we rely on it, we look forward to working with you and I very much assure you that we have taken note of the increase in the cooperation of the Commission in finding, through informal procedures, friendly solutions which are good for you, good for us and, above all, good for the citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel it was a practical example of how we can create good civic cooperation networks which can produce results. The speeches by all members of the Committee on Petitions have shown how widely accepted the analysis of the European Ombudsman’s work is and, more importantly, how broad is the support for the objectives of that work.</p>
<p class="contents">There is undoubtedly a kind of synergy and osmosis between the two bodies, which makes it easier for us to share one another’s best practices. We will therefore be attempting to copy the Ombudsman’s experience of putting his services online in order to move closer to citizens, if not physically, at least through the new technologies available, and also to be more efficient. The Ombudsman will certainly be drawing closer to us too, as he has done at other times, by supporting the petitions of citizens that have been forwarded to the Ombudsman in error and that actually fall within the Committee on Petitions’ remit. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Ombudsman who, correctly and appropriately as always, reiterated the prerogatives of the Committee on Petitions by crucially referring back to us some complaints, or I think perhaps it was one complaint, made by a citizen about the conduct of the Committee on Petitions, which I represent, thereby giving further confirmation of the straightforwardness and transparency of our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Commissioner Šefčovič for his timely presence here, for the hard work he does every day, and I have no doubt that the wishes he has expressed are extremely sincere and that they are also achievable as far as he is concerned. Sadly, over the years I have noticed that, despite its good intentions, the Commission is still slow to adapt to the genuine need for greater simplification, greater immediacy, and a closer relationship that are expressed by citizens in the complaints received each day by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. It is about this not particularly positive fact that I plead for the hundredth time with Commissioner Šefčovič, who I know is committed to looking after the interests of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last two years the European Ombudsman has made promising progress towards ensuring that its activity becomes transparent and understandable for EU citizens. I feel we must not lose sight of this trend, especially now that the European Year of Citizens is approaching. However, it is worthwhile emphasising that while the Treaty of Lisbon armed the world of direct democracies with new rights, notably citizens’ initiatives, we have to be careful with the critical powers regarding freedom of information. As I urged in my speech last October, in terms of access to information we must respect the fact that information can arise in relation to law enforcement, security and defence policy that guarantees the security of European citizens because it is confidential – therefore greater access cannot be called for in connection with classified information, especially not in the spirit of political marketing. At the same time, what is important and indeed exemplary from the report’s perspective is if the Ombudsman undertakes to ensure that institutions and institutional practices change and develop in line with the needs and efforts of citizens to a certain extent. It would be ideal if we were able to handle all the problems where they occur, based on clear and transparent standards. We hope that the Ombudsman intends to carry out his tasks in view of these considerations and with an open mind to the needs of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
