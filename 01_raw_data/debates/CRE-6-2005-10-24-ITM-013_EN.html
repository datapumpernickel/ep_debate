This is an area where the European Union could perhaps be doing more to push the Romanian authorities to increase the pace of reform. For example, last year 4600 babies were abandoned in maternity hospitals. Some were reunited with their families but many remain there. I lifted up a little boy of 18 months who had never been outside a maternity hospital. This is not something we want to see. We need emergency fostering in Romania and we need the European Union to push for that.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the institutional care of adults with handicaps, I visited an institution where 450 people were living in awful conditions, unacceptable to us here in the European Union. Some progress is being made but more could be done if we put greater pressure on the Romanian authorities. I would ask that we all do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That Treaty retained the principle of a common agricultural policy agreed in 1957, including the article which states that EU policy is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture. Yet, within two years, Commissioner Mandelson seems to be prepared to sacrifice the European model of agriculture in order to hammer out a deal at the WTO, by forcing farmers to bear a disproportionate share of the burden. At the same time we have Mr Barroso offering deals which undermine pledges given to farmers in the context of CAP reform, in order to move Prime Minister Blair on the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU demands traceability, cross-compliance and food security from its farmers, and rightly so, but in return it is threatening to break its promises, causing huge uncertainty in the agricultural community, and it is proposing to sell out its primary food producers for a quick-fix deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this retrograde step is not just shameful in terms of its result, but also in view of the way the result has been achieved: since April, Mr Barroso has been consulting the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs — which is competent in this area and to which I belong ― entirely avoiding any debate and, furthermore, failing to comply with the applicable rules. Furthermore, it should be stressed that many other Members, including Presidents of this Parliament, have expressed their opposition in this regard.</p>

Dr David Nabarro, UN coordinator for avian and human influenza, has stressed that, to prevent a pandemic of human infection, the global response to the bird flu epidemic must be intensified. The United States has ordered approximately 100 million dollars’ worth of vaccine. The United Nations, by contrast, has a total budget of around USD 7 million to control animal outbreaks of avian flu, but requires USD 175 million for an effective programme.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that, in addition to the evident problem of slow manufacturing processes, it appears unlikely that there will be enough flu shots available for all those who might need them. However, it might be possible to contain an H5N1 outbreak at its source, if the surrounding population were immediately vaccinated. I would like to raise the question of whether we in the European Union would be prepared to share the vaccines we already have in our possession with regions where an outbreak occurs, in an effort to contain it. It should not just be a matter of having vaccines in case it affects our own citizens: if there is an outbreak, we should target it wherever it occurs and try to ensure that it does not spread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Estonia is a full Member of the EU. This concerns the Union’s external border.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake today, an alternative to our values, i.e. the Commission’s appeasement of Russia or the reliability of the EU for the new members. The danger that the EU could lose reliability was noticed at the London Summit, where the Russian-Estonian border issue, which is the subject of the commitments between Russia and the EU, became marginalised. The two governments were suggested to sort the problem out and the Commission would stand aside and wash its hands of the matter. Among these two was one big government and one small. The big and angry one dared to ask the Commission to take Russia’s side and bring smaller new Member States to order. They became disobedient to Russia, and that was bad. This was precisely the position expressed recently by the Russian Ambassador, Mr Chizhov, in Brussels.</p>

I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate my point: the journalist Mario Henrique Mayo, who in 2003 was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment, has made two suicide attempts after having used a razor blade to etch the words ‘innocent’ and ‘freedom’ on his own body. On 4 October, the journalist Victor Arroyo who, for expressing an opinion that constituted an offence, was sentenced to 26 years in jail, ended his hunger strike at Cardinal Ortega’s request after having ended up in a delirium.</p>
<p class="contents">For 100 other political prisoners, there is not a single prospect of liberation; quite the opposite is the case. The moderate opponent Manuel Cuesta Morua has been beaten up by a collection of regime supporters and has been at the receiving end of extreme racist abuse. I hope that this House will present a united front in denouncing the human rights violations in Cuba. It will send out a better message than that of a future European Commissioner who once, while smoking a Havana cigar, accepted a ride on a Harley Davidson with Fidel Castro, but has never breathed a word about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, leave the European Union, but trade freely with Europe and the world. That, of course, is the policy of the United Kingdom Independence Party.

There is a wide gap between old and new Member States. The past and further extension of the EU makes this a particularly opportune time for the informal summit to also address the European social model. I agree that the most powerful weapon against poverty is the provision of more and better jobs. In a world of working adults the children would not inherit the damnation of poverty – they would inherit chances, and the elderly would be able to live in safety. However, this cannot be achieved without community expenditure.

However, Luxemburgish deserves to be given more recognition, because many people are not aware of the fact that we have our own language, in defence of which we suffered fierce repression during the Nazi occupation.

<p class="contents">After 1939, private property, and in particular land, was confiscated in Lithuania in line with Soviet law. After the country gained independence, the Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled that all vacant and undeveloped land was to be returned in kind to the rightful owners or their heirs. Unfortunately, the Lithuanian executive and autonomous local authorities pay little attention to the sacred right to property. In defiance of court rulings, they have failed to return land that was seized many years ago. This primarily affects Poles living in Lithuania, who constitute a sizeable national minority. By acting in this way, Lithuania is not only violating the right to property, but also discriminating against national minorities, in this case the Polish minority.

Recently, the British Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, current President of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, said there can be no negotiation about the re-creation of the caliphate; no negotiation about the imposition of Sharia law; no negotiation about the suppression of equality between the sexes or about the ending of free speech. He said that these values are fundamental to our civilisation and are simply not up for negotiation. This raises the question of why, in Iraq, the British and Americans have encouraged the adoption of a constitution which enshrines Sharia law and will severely curb the freedom of many women.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that over 70 women have been elected to the parliament in Afghanistan. However, the editor of a women’s rights magazine – a male editor, by the way – has been jailed for anti-Islamic articles. In both countries women face harassment, violent attacks, death threats and murder because they are women. So I hope that this Parliament will hold governments like Britain’s to their promises on sex equality, on free speech and on avoiding the imposition of Sharia law in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the airline cites in its defence security considerations in the event of an emergency evacuation, it seems unacceptable to me to trivialise discriminatory practices of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the founding values of the European Union is one in which we must take particular pride, and that is solidarity towards the weakest. Increased attention is being paid to disabled people and to their ability to access public buildings and services. It is therefore shocking that a European airline should hide behind the argument of security considerations in order to discriminate against blind passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth of the matter is that the excessive emphasis on keeping flight costs low no longer allows for special attention to be paid to passengers needing help: there are no staff to look after them. Profitability is the only goal in mind, regardless of any human feeling. That runs counter to humanitarian values, of which Europe can be proud.

International organisations active in this field are sounding the alarm bells, since the ecological time bombs that are ticking as a result of the improper storage of chemical waste represent an increasing threat.</p>
<p class="contents">It is estimated that only somewhat more than 25 000 tonnes of pesticides are stockpiled in the eight Central European countries that joined the European Union in 2004. In the states of the former Soviet Union, however, or in other words our close and distant neighbours to the east and south, over 200 000 tonnes of obsolete and unprotected chemicals may be stockpiled, which are dispersed by the wind and washed away by rainwater. This means that no corner of the globe is safe from the threat.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on Parliament to turn its attention to this issue, which is one that has been neglected to date. A detailed plan of action should be drawn up without delay, aimed at the stocktaking, identification and destruction of all stockpiles of obsolete pesticides and other hazardous chemicals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this decision, the European Union has highlighted the strategic importance of Croatia and its positive influence on the democratisation of the entire Balkans region. Agreement on this point was reached also by the representatives of fifteen Central and Eastern European countries at the 12th annual summit of Central and Eastern European heads of state, held in Zagreb on 14-15 October. The presidents expressed support for Croatia and agreed that the enlargement of the European Union must not be brought to a halt.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia will be providing very active support to Croatia to help the country catch up with Romania and Bulgaria, which have now been conducting accession negotiations for several years. Slovakia will share with Croatia its experience from the pre-accession process during which it succeeded in catching up with the other accession countries, and achieved an excellent result.

<p class="contents">Unsubstantiated accusations have been made public regarding the sale to Denmark of raspberries that were allegedly rotten and infected with a rare virus that causes food poisoning. The Danish media have set themselves up in judgment on the matter, claiming that five people have died and nearly one thousand have suffered food poisoning as a result of eating desserts containing raspberries. These accusations are quite clearly absurd, as proved by the fact that raspberries grown by the same companies were exported to Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Sweden, Russia and the USA, without any cases of food poisoning being reported in these countries. What is more, detailed checks carried out in the companies at the centre of the accusations have revealed that raspberries are grown there under model conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Polish authorities suggested to the Danes that trade should be suspended if the raspberries were in fact found to cause food poisoning, but there has been no response from the Danish authorities. I fail to understand the tacit public consent of the latter. To date the authorities have taken no action whatsoever on this matter, and they have also failed to deny the false allegations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 1956 revolution was followed in Poland by the Solidarity movement and in 1968 by the Prague Spring. 1956 marked a Hungarian uprising against Soviet occupation, a fight for freedom, a fight for national independence, and at the same time a fight against Communist dictatorship.
