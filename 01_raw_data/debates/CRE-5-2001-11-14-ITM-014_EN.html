<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in March 2000, the Lisbon European Council set out a new strategy for the coming decade. At that time we were working on the basis of very optimistic economic data and really thought that we could bring about sustainable growth of at least 3%, along with economic reform, full employment and also social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Today our starting point is more difficult because the global economy has gone in the opposite direction and even the European Union, despite its readiness to reform and the reforms which it has already implemented, is experiencing an economic downturn. That is why the following question is now much more urgent than it was during the preparations for the first spring summit in Stockholm: how does the Commission intend to continue this ambitious process of making the European Union, on the basis of innovation and knowledge, the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, and enabling it to overcome the problems which I have described?</p>
<p class="contents">This question is all the more pertinent for the spring summit in Barcelona because, after evaluating a strategy of this kind for two years, it ought to be possible to identify the areas where national and European policy have actually been guided by the quantitative and qualitative objectives and see to what extent it has been possible to bundle measures together and make them visible. The Member States' budgets have actually shown uniform increases across the board in investment in research and development, innovation and further development of the information and communication society.</p>
<p class="contents">The few figures which are available to us in the European Parliament unfortunately do not yet speak the specific language which we would have liked, because we had hoped that the Lisbon strategy and its consistent implementation would also have yielded visible added value as a result of economic, financial, employment and social policy being coordinated at European level, so as to demonstrate to the public the benefits which European policy can have for them and quite specifically how it can improve their quality of life and work. We should certainly also ask what approach has been adopted to achieve the ambitious aim of increasing investment in the European Union. How has cross-border investment in infrastructure actually been made visible apart from through reports? The European Parliament needs to ask all of these questions because, in drafting its synthesis report, the Commission has the duty of actually producing a blueprint for the further consultations at the spring summit, which will then, of course, in the end, form the broad guidelines of the future economic policy of the European Union and its Member States. In the current economic downturn and at a time when we are also facing particular challenges because of the adverse economic consequences of the terrible terrorist acts of 11 September – and in considering these issues we have to take into account a new aspect, the collapse of consumer confidence – we must also ask ourselves the following question: what can we do to stop a self-fulfilling prophecy, which states that we are sliding into recession, from becoming a reality?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore bears great responsibility for taking more of a lead on setting targets and taking more practical action to reform the economy, not only with respect to the labour market, but also with respect to the other markets, full employment and also social inclusion, by issuing specific guidance on these areas. Of course this also raises the question, and I should also like to address this particularly to you, Commissioner, of whether the tax situation, where unfortunately we still have countries pursuing independent national policies rather than coordinated ones, does not have an adverse impact on investment in the European Union and, in particular, on cross-border investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Parliament is still not clear about how it is actually, finally to be involved in this whole process, which is now approaching its second spring summit. So far we have not been involved as partners in the macro-economic dialogue. There are no plans to organise another forum with all of the stakeholders, as was done before the Lisbon meeting. It really is legitimate to ask whether the European Parliament's involvement is adequate and whether it is therefore able to represent the interests of the people in this process of setting priorities for the European Union's economic and structural policy. We really are in a situation where we need to mobilise our forces and rally optimism. How do you envisage doing this in your synthesis report? What working methods do you intend to choose and which guidelines do you intend to issue in it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, in reply to the questions from Mrs Randzio-Plath, I should like to say first of all that the Commission's synthesis report for the spring European Council in March 2002 is currently being prepared. As requested by the European Council, that report will assess the progress made on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the Lisbon strategy. I mention the environmental dimension in particular since the Göteborg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of this assessment will consider the progress made by Council and Parliament on the Lisbon reform agenda. The assessment will draw on the series of structural indicators which have been proposed by the Commission in its communication of 30 October 2001. As Mrs Randzio-Plath knows, those structural indicators are a very accurate reflection of the progress made and the Commission thinks it is a valuable instrument. The objective of sustainable development will underpin the assessment of each strand of that strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of the synthesis report will also depend on further work by this Parliament and the Council up to the end of this year. It is somewhat early, therefore, to be specific about the contents and structure of the reports at this stage. I agree nevertheless with Mrs Randzio-Plath that the synthesis report will need to take account of the likely situation by the time the Barcelona European Council is held. This means, on the one hand, the new international situation to which she has referred, and, on the other hand, the introduction of the euro on 1 January next year.</p>
<p class="contents">At the recent informal summit in Ghent, Heads of State and Government and the Commission renewed their commitment to pursuing the Lisbon strategy of structural and economic reform and social renewal with determination as a response to both those factors, the new environment and the introduction of the euro. Continuity and the long-term focus of the reform agenda will need to be maintained, especially in view of the current economic downturn.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic situation in the euro area and worldwide has made it necessary to adjust economic policy. But the confirmation by the Ghent European Council of its commitment to the stability and growth pact has brought confidence that the basic policy framework of economic and monetary union will be preserved and it has certainly facilitated the recent further adjustments in monetary policy. This shows that economic policy coordination is working.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless there is still further scope for strengthening economic policy coordination in line with the proposals put forward by the Commission, with a view to fostering a common assessment of the economic situation and appropriate economic policy responses. To reinforce that message, Mr Prodi is writing to this Parliament, to the President of the Council and to the Heads of State and Government this week, urging them to continue their efforts to make progress before Barcelona on key elements of the Lisbon reforms, such as the Community patent and the telecoms review, in line with the existing timetable, as well as on a number of the financial services proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The synthesis report by its nature covers a wide area of the Commission's activity. A number of Commission services are therefore contributing to its preparation and this work is being monitored at political level by a group of Commissioners dealing with growth, competitiveness, employment and sustainable development. The report should be adopted by the Commission on 15 January 2002 and will be submitted to this Parliament on the same day. By submitting the report at an early stage, it is intended to allow the other European institutions to give their views on the report in good time in order to contribute to the work of the European Council in Barcelona. I believe that is precisely what Mrs Randzio-Plath wants.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the open method of coordination, that is largely intended in the context of the Lisbon strategy to develop indicators at Member State level and to share best practice and experience. It is used in line with the principles set out in the White Paper on governance in areas where legislative action under the <span class="italic">methode communataire</span>, the Community method, is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have answered the questions put by Mrs Randzio-Plath. As I have said on earlier occasions, I shall be delighted to come and make a presentation to her committee and discuss what the Commission intends to do at the Barcelona Summit in further detail. But it would be useful if my future discussion with the EMAC committee could take place after 15 January, because by then both Parliament and I will be in possession of the documents that will be the Commission's input into the Barcelona Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that Commissioner Bolkestein has said that he is willing to discuss the content of the proposed synthesis report in committee, since it must be the basis for a discussion at a meeting which we hope will be very important and which will take place in my city and the city of the President for this sitting. We therefore have a special interest in Barcelona being a genuine success and that it be remembered as a truly significant advance in terms of the commitments we have been taking on since the meeting in Lisbon last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to insist on one aspect which both the Commission and the Liberal Group have been highlighting. This is the need to consolidate and clarify the mechanisms and objectives in the field of economic and monetary policy. There is a degree of confusion, as you know, and this has been discussed both in the Commission and in this House, between the Europe of the euro (which, as the Commissioner has said, is now close to completing its final stage with the introduction of notes and coins), the external representation of the euro and, on the other hand, the system for adopting decisions in the field of economic and monetary policy. We know that this situation is unsatisfactory and the current crisis highlights this.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the present situation can be genuinely overcome, in the way that Commissioner Bolkestein’s colleague, Commissioner Solbes, has often said optimistically. However, at the same time he has been obliged to lower the growth forecasts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to insist on this aspect and on another which the Commissioner has not mentioned and which I believe is very important within the various elements of Lisbon and their subsequent implementation: the training and technology element.</p>
<p class="contents">Lisbon set the objective of a fully competitive society by 2010, in which we would be able to overcome our technological and scientific backwardness in comparison with the United States, which was the term of reference established in Lisbon. I believe that this is an element which also has to be introduced into this synthesis report, and at subsequent meetings views have been expressed in agreement with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I stress the fact that progress made since Lisbon has been insufficient. In the area of financial services, for example, the Commission intends to have a mid-term review meeting in February next year to stimulate more political interest in perfecting the internal market and achieving the difficult targets we were set by the Lisbon European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">But I stress that we have not done what we should have. Considerable difficulties remain and we must use the meeting in Lisbon to make further progress. It would be a good thing if Ecofin ministers were present in Barcelona so that they could do, on the spot, what members of the European Council want them to do. So far members of the European Council have engaged in laudatory statements but when ministers have to deal with the subjects at hand the political will seems to evaporate. If the Ecofin ministers were to be present at the Barcelona Council perhaps they could solve these problems there and then. In the case of patents, the European Council has instructed the Council to come to a decision before Christmas this year. I am not optimistic. That underscores the need for the Barcelona European Council to be practical and emphasises the need to make more progress than have been made up until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
