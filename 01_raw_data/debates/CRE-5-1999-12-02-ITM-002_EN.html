<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Torres Marques (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT) </span>Mr President, I have here an illustration on the subject of my report that I would like to be distributed to all those present. I would be grateful if you would instruct that this be done. I would like to begin my intervention by thanking Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira for being here today in the Chamber. I was told that the Commissioner had prior engagements, a meeting with the Central Banks, but that when he was told this debate was to take place at the same time, he chose to be here in Parliament today. I would like to acknowledge his choice and to thank him. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the scope of this report is the duration of the transitional period of the euro. On my proposal, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed to broaden its scope as the subject that had been proposed had, in the meantime, been superseded by various events, one of which was the European Parliament’s own electoral process. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, we have other real problems. The more hearings I have attended and the more reports I have read on these matters, the more convinced I am that the general tendency is, on the one hand, towards a drastic curtailing of the transitional period for the dual circulation of national currency units and euros and, on the other, towards having a frontloading period which it is anticipated will start from 1 December 2001. </p>
<p class="contents">The more we look into this problem and the more we talk to those directly involved – consumers and retailers – the more we see that the predominant idea is that the longer the period of dual circulation, the more complicated things will be. The idea that ‘extending the transitional period will make things easier’ is finding fewer and fewer supporters. The illustration that I asked to be distributed gives a better explanation than many arguments can of the difficulties that we may have to face. Accepting as we do that the transitional period should last until 1 January 2002, it is now important to raise the other problems, the proper resolution of which is of great importance to the credibility of the euro that we all wish to see. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in this report, Mr President, Commissioner, only maximum periods are referred to and preference is given to periods which are as short as possible so that all scenarios might be viable, even the legal ‘big bang’ if, by 2002, this is accepted as the best solution. Our main proposals are:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, a period of dual circulation of national currency units and euros which is as short as possible; </p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, a period of advance feeding or “frontloading” to banks, retailers, public administrations and consumers from 1 December 2001; </p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, to set prices in euros with their equivalent in the national currency, preferably by 1 January 2001;</p>
<p class="contents">- fourthly, information campaigns of increasing intensity until 2002, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, through systematic action together with the education system, NGOs and the media in general; particularly prime time television, television news broadcasts and sports programmes with high viewing figures; </p>
<p class="contents">- fifthly, the increased use of electronic money, credit and debit cards and the creation of an electronic card or purse which can be used throughout the euro zone as soon as is technically possible and that its use is widespread enough for the cost to be minimal; </p>
<p class="contents">- sixthly, the adaptation of vending machines for the use of charge cards until 2002 which will enable them, as far as possible, to work with coins and notes; </p>
<p class="contents">- seventhly, the creation, to be postponed until 2002 at the latest, of an integrated payment system which will enable us to transform the euro zone into a market with the same rules as domestic markets. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, each one of the issues addressed in this report requires more detailed and deeper examination, as their application needs to be completely secure, clear and fully accepted by our citizens. We therefore hope that the Commission will introduce the measures that it feels must be adopted in this area. On account of its implications for the lives of our citizens, this issue must be closely supported by the European Parliament, the direct representative of the electors. I hope that the Commission, the Council and the European Central Bank only take decisions that are fundamental to this issue, having consulted us first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also, in accordance with this scenario, the Council, backed by this House, has decided that euro coins and banknotes will be circulated as legal tender as from 1 January 2002. One of Madrid’s key contributions is that it drafted a clear schedule early on, which was preceded by extensive deliberation. </p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the Commission in its viewpoint that the so-called transitional period should ideally be maintained, despite the fact that its lapsing coincides with the frantic Christmas shopping period. Preparations are now too far advanced to be able to successfully implement any changes. </p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January 2002, the euro will become legal tender within the euro zone. National currency units will remain in circulation for a maximum of six months, but national legislators may decide to shorten this period within their territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Many will not be fully aware of the advent of the euro and monetary union until they have to make the changeover in their own purses. Whether or not the general public will accept all the work involved in Economic and Monetary Union will be determined by the way in which the actual changeover around 2002 will pan out. All predictable and avoidable complications and hitches must therefore be ironed out beforehand. </p>
<p class="contents">In my group, many fear the confusion, lack of security, feelings of uncertainty and waste of time brought on by dual currency circulation. The ‘big bang’ scenario remains attractive to us, but not all Member States share this opinion, hence our appeal to at least keep periods of dual currency circulation to a minimum. </p>
<p class="contents">At any rate, a smooth transition accompanied by a short period of dual currency circulation or not, as the case may be, is impossible without frontloading. To our great relief, the European Central Bank has abandoned its previous stance against frontloading. Frontloading is a must in order to make the practical introduction of the euro a success. In the resolution, we recommend frontloading subject to cautious conditions. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on two other aspects. Firstly, we share the rapporteur’s vision that in the case of dual circulation, change in the retail trade should be given in euros. This will, in fact, help shorten the period of dual currency circulation within Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are convinced that dual price display is a good thing. Alongside euros, we definitely want to see pricing in national currency for a period after 2002. This is mainly beneficial to the consumer but the retail trade too realises that it stands to benefit from this. However, to talk about imposing statutory obligations concerning these two aspects now does not seem appropriate to us, certainly not at this early stage. </p>
<p class="contents">You will have realised that, according to the PPE Group, Mrs Torres Marques has done a sterling job and we fully endorse her report. We will only suggest a few refinements when the amendments are discussed at the vote. We hope that the Member States and also the European institutions will continue to bear in mind that we are also to be consulted at future stages, so that the introduction of euro coins and banknotes in 2002 will be a huge success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the euro is already the second most important currency in the world. The actual introduction of the euro from 2002 will dramatically increase the demand for euros. Although the euro has depreciated over the last few months in relation to the dollar, this is not only due to the current difference in the dynamism and the performance of the American and European economies. The fact that, for the moment, the euro is only a representative currency and will not become a paper currency until 2002, also explains the certain lack of interest among the European and international public in this new currency that you cannot yet feel or touch.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the financial markets in general have welcomed the euro. Since it was introduced at the beginning of this year, the volume of private bonds issued in euros has increased by over 50%. For the first seven months of this year on the international capital markets, issues in euros represented 27% of international issues. Meanwhile, issues in dollars over the same seven month period fell from 57% to 50%, which shows that there is already a very strong real demand by the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another problem, to which I should like to draw the attention of this House, and that is the huge money supply of Deutschmarks, French francs and other European currencies circulating outside the frontiers of Europe. According to a report by the German Bundesbank, over one hundred billion Deutschmarks are used as a daily reserve currency by the citizens of Eastern Europe. There are also billions of French francs circulating in French-speaking Africa and all this money must be changed into euros. For the moment, the people holding these banknotes are trying to move towards the dollar, which also perhaps explains, to a certain extent, the fluctuation to the detriment of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commission whether it should not take the initiative in drawing the attention of the Central European Bank and the national central banks to this problem, that is to say, the necessary exchange of all the European currencies that will disappear in 2002 with the actual introduction of the euro. I believe that there is a real problem here which has not been adequately discussed and in respect of which the Commission would be well advised to take an initiative in order to organise this exchange with dignity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro is not a goal in itself, but a means to serve the European citizen, a strong economy, employment and the international status of the European Union. It is a means to promote more stability, more transparency, more clarity, more convenience of payment, more saving options and better investment opportunities. </p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat what the honourable rapporteur has already stated as to how we need to tackle the changeover of national currency units to euros in practical terms, but I would like to make two observations regarding her report. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the euro probably has only one drawback, namely the inevitable transitional period; that is to say, all the adjustments required to fully integrate the national currency units into the new tender. If we wish to limit the damage, then it is indeed important to keep the period of dual currency circulation to a minimum. If it is based on sound framework measures, there is no need for initial hesitation before taking the final and definitive step towards the euro. I therefore back the technical measures proposed by the rapporteur. I would congratulate her on the level of clarity displayed. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are responsible for keeping the attention given to, and interest in, the euro alive. The present situation is not conducive in this respect. The introduction of the euro on 1 January this year enjoyed a great deal of attention, even a certain euphoria, but it all went quiet after that for the single currency. The euro is still too far removed from the European citizen. It is still a while before 2002, when the euro will be introduced as actual currency. This is too long according to public opinion. The appetite has gone. Moreover, this interim phase creates far too many insecurities. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, we need to be able to maintain our belief in and enthusiasm for the euro during the warming-up stage as well, although ensuring at the same time that people do not lose interest before the euro actually takes off. After all, the euro needs to remain a success and we need to make every effort to achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, investors who have decided to convert their money into dollars or pounds sterling have undoubtedly reaped greater rewards up till now than those who invested in the euro. One final point: today the currencies of the various countries could be viewed as subcurrencies of the euro, but the banks do not see it this way. Today, even on small amounts there is much more commission when buying and selling lira, Belgian francs or French francs than when buying dollars or pounds sterling. I think that we should take action on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meanwhile, virtually everyone in this House shares the view that 1 January 2002 is really the earliest date and that government offices, banks and mint establishments have to pull out all the stops in order to meet this deadline</p>
<p class="contents">Recital K, which contains a complaint to the effect that the electronic euro is lacking in immediate practical benefits, is still a leftover of the unrealistic expectations which were – and apparently still are – prevalent among a majority of MEPs. The fact that the euro propaganda campaign is not delivering the goods is entirely down to a lack of sense of reality which is playing tricks here. </p>
<p class="contents">I strongly object to the proposal to provide the European citizen with euro coins and banknotes before 1 January 2002. This contravenes the Treaty and also plays into the hands of counterfeiters. They too will then be provided with the material to be copied sooner and will be able to better exploit the confusion easily created among the citizens. We would much prefer it if the European Central Bank and the European Commission, in tandem with the commercial banks, were to ensure that the general public receives sound, detailed information on the design and security features of the euro coins and banknotes, starting no later than 1 November 2001. </p>

<p class="contents">A new chapter in this story is now opening and must be characterised by the following elements: public confidence in, and acceptance of, the euro must be further strengthened. The measures taken must result in legal security and must be transparent, the citizens must be given comprehensive information, and a smooth-running changeover is an essential prerequisite for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The changeover will only run smoothly if there is adequate frontloading for banks, commerce, citizens and the requisite machines from where citizens obtain their cash. I would like to pick out one aspect alone. It seems to me that the concept of commerce has not yet been clearly defined. For example, will the tourist industry come under the heading of commerce, i.e. will frontloading apply, bearing in mind that a great many citizens of our Member States visit tourist areas and ski resorts during the Christmas and New Year periods in particular. I would therefore ask that we organise these elements – acceptance and confidence, a smooth-running changeover and frontloading – so as to increase citizens’ confidence in the euro in this phase, and this will entail frontloading and ensuring that adequate information is provided in the euro campaign. If this comes off, then the changeover will be another chapter in the euro success story. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur rightly emphasises the careful preparations leading up to the introduction of the euro, and we must ensure that the euro does indeed enjoy the confidence of the citizens and not just that of the markets, where it is now established. The first year of the euro’s introduction and life with monetary union is associated, then, with a lack of awareness of the euro on the part of the citizens, that is to say the consumers. It is not without reason that as yet, only 1% of transfers and 4% of credit card transactions are performed in euros. This would suggest that we really do need information campaigns. Not only did we need to have these campaigns in the years before monetary union started, we also need to pursue them now that it is in force, and this is not a task that we should just leave to the European Central Bank. We, too, in our capacity as European Commission, European Parliament, and governments of the Member States, must launch a new initiative in this respect, so that political discussions on the value of the euro do not cause the citizens to suddenly start thinking that, although they may inhabit a monetary union, this has lent no added value to Europe. Rather, they must be made aware of the fact that they are living in an age of new monetary reform.</p>
<p class="contents">This false assumption, which is still very much prevalent because the exchange rate between the euro, the dollar and the yen has, I regret to say, developed rather differently than appeared would be the case on 4 January, must not, however, lead to a situation in which erroneous ideas as to the value of the euro hold sway. The internal value of the currency is decisive and the fact that we can record values for the euro 11-zone that truly inspire confidence is of historic importance. It is a good thing that it is becoming clear, and is made transparent time and time again in the monetary dialogue between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank, how important price stability is for this independent, monetary authority; and it is a good thing that the ECB should see that this goal is accomplished in a manner accessible to ordinary citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe it would be wrong to break out in a panic now, here in this Chamber, on account of exchange rate trends. I think the exchange rates are exhausted in any case. The important thing to do in these circumstances, though, is to support the development of the euro by having more coordination of economic policy within the European Union. Monetary policy will not be in a position to enhance the credibility of European integration for the benefit of growth, employment and also investment, if the Member States of the European Union do not, coincidentally with the harmonisation and centralisation of monetary policy, join forces more resolutely in giving out signals against tax dumping and social dumping, and in favour of increased employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament are in agreement about ratifying the timetable for the introduction of the euro agreed at the Madrid European Council of 1995. This consensus demonstrates that careful management of the various periods is the key to the success of the operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our efforts must be concentrated on ensuring that this transition goes smoothly. Our role is to protect the interests of the people, particularly those who are disadvantaged. Respect for the timetable will provide the time needed for the information to reach everyone and may also allow the dual circulation period to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs maintains that this period should not exceed two months. The ECB, the Commission and the national authorities will therefore have to adopt a series of measures, some of which have already been mentioned. For example, they will have to provide consumers, traders and banks with the necessary quantity of coins and notes before 1 January 2002. They will have to ensure that dual price display is in general use for 1 January 2001. They will have to use this process to modernise our payment systems and they will have to adopt the necessary measures to ensure adequate legal protection against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">If the euro is to bring greater freedom to individuals and companies and increased rationality in their decision making, they must previously have become familiar with the new system. In this respect, the recommendations on communication and information policies contained in the Torres Marques report have a vital role to play. However, we should not imagine that the euro will perfect the single market or that it will allow, for example, easier price comparison or a reduction in transaction costs. The benefits of the euro must be more than just material for they must help to strengthen the political union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will try to facilitate the switch to the new currency in terms of cash by allowing the euro and national currencies to exist side by side for a few months. Parliament also supports frontloading and would, in this way, like to remove the barriers to the swift introduction of the currency. It now appears that the European Central Bank is also gradually beginning to endorse this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, underestimate how important it is for the citizens of Europe to be prepared for the change. When Germany reunited, the West German mark was introduced into the former East Germany immediately with no major catastrophe occurring, such as those the big bang sceptics are currently describing with regard to the introduction of the euro. In many countries, the euro, with few exceptions, could be adopted within a short period of time. For example, in my country, Finland, the number of coins and notes in relation to GNP is the smallest in Europe. In addition, the ever-growing number of credit cards in relation to the population is by far the greatest. For example, I would support the big bang model for Finland. The big bang would actually only cause problems for cash dispensing machines. It will not be possible to change all the machines in one night, so the old currency should continue to be used as legal tender at least for some period of time, in cash dispensers at least.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens must have the real feeling that the euro is of benefit to them, and not something that is going to make life difficult. At present, there is a dearth of direct practical benefits, since, for example, developments in the euro zone as far as cross-border purchases and currency exchange services are concerned have not been to the satisfaction of the public. The introduction of the euro must be made easy for the public and consumers. Problems for special groups must be minimised. Everything possible must be done in remote areas to ease the introduction of the euro. Supplies of the new currency delivered early on would support these aims. What is essential for the public is not how long dual circulation lasts, but how long the banks will exchange former currencies for euros without charge. The banks should offer a free currency exchange service for at least six months, even though dual circulation might have ceased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather, it is in the running for the title of world’s largest folly, for it is designed to give the world’s largest trading block a single currency built upon a foundation which, until the introduction of this currency, it had only been possible to hold in place for a period of five post-war years in Germany. In every other year, the rate of inflation has been more than 2%. To make an idol of this rate is not only stupid but also a direct assault upon the many families in which the father or mother is now coming home with a redundancy notice instead of a wage slip. EMU’s holy cow is worse than the holy cows of India. The latter do not in the least prevent opportunities from arising to create growth and employment. </p>
<p class="contents">The absurdity becomes apparent when Danish economic policy is compared with that pursued in the eleven euro or EMU countries. Over the last five years, growth in Denmark has been twice as great: 20% instead of 10%, and the rate of unemployment has been halved. That should be considered good by any ordinary person’s standards but, in EMU, such a policy would be downright illegal; in fact, more than that, unconstitutional, because it was put in place with a Budget deficit of 3.9%. The policy would have incurred a fine of EUR 500-600 million. Some people say that the policy can be changed when politicians sit together round the table, but that is somewhat non-sensical because the policy may only be altered by amending the treaty itself, the basic law, the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam. This is where the errors arise from. The Central Bank may be criticised for raising interest rates instead of reducing unemployment, but it is only doing what the Treaty says it must do. It is the Treaty which should be altered. The single currency ought at least to be converted into a common currency allowing countries to have their own rates of exchange for the purposes of pursuing economic policies which benefit employment. In that way, one economic policy or the other might be pursued. The countries themselves should be allowed to decide which. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My presence here reflects the importance which the Commission and I myself, as the Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, continue to place on the whole process of the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">As emphasised by several speakers, the introduction of the euro has so far clearly been a great success, despite the debates which we may be having on certain specific points. It is also clear, again as highlighted throughout this debate, that the moment of truth will be when the coins and notes enter into circulation on 1 January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I must comment on the practical problems which are bound to arise, as indicated in the report. If we had to describe what is to happen, we would not use the terms ‘big bang’ or ‘dual circulation’. The proposed shortening of the periods is actually intended to ensure a rapid introduction of coins and notes and perhaps this is the new description which we should be using. Yet this rapid introduction cannot occur overnight. There can be no big bang, but neither are we talking about a long period of dual circulation. We are therefore concerned with the minimum time needed so that the introduction is rapid. This is positive.</p>
<p class="contents">This clearly leads to the second problem of frontloading. This has been debated, as you well know, by both the European Central Bank and ECOFIN. The latter has already discussed frontloading with coins but frontloading with notes, outside the financial system, poses legal and practical difficulties. However, these difficulties, particularly where linked to the type of coin or note currently being supplied by cash dispensers, could be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore facing some specific problems which have been mentioned. What will happen in the period at the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002 when many people will be travelling around Europe? How will we solve this problem? This is clearly a specific point which must be carefully considered and for which an answer must be sought. We cannot ask travellers using their national currency to change this in a place which is not their country of origin as this would cause practical problems of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problem of dual price display, I agree with the idea that we should set a date from which the dual display of prices is absolutely compulsory. This is the only way to start making any comparison. However, we are all aware that only in the last months of 2001 will people really start to make comparisons. In my opinion, the price difference will involve such a substantial change that the references to the old prices will quickly disappear. We will all have to adapt to the new prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The report raises one particularly important point on the problem of the communication policy and the people who will find it more difficult to adapt to the new situation. Some speakers have also referred to the need to continue this communication policy with which I totally agree. The Commission is currently preparing a new plan of action on the communication policy. This plan will, of course, involve this House. We believe that this operation must be carried out by all the institutions involved in the process, and particularly the European Parliament, as the institution most directly in contact with the people. We have already discussed this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but I will repeat my offer that I am prepared to start examining how to resolve most effectively the communication problems arising between everyone. We will have to include in this plan the people who will have more difficulty in gaining an adequate understanding of the new currency. These will be the people who, for one reason or another, will have certain specific problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The electronic money issue will not cause any particular difficulties. However, one interesting point to be stressed is the problem of payment systems, particularly in retail operations. The payment system for major transactions has worked very well but we all agree that the problem of the excessive charges currently imposed on money-changing is generating ill feeling. This is because we expected a reduction in the costs of money-changing during this period and these expectations have not been borne out.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority is to set up compensation systems or payment systems allowing us to reduce these costs. Initiatives have already been taken in this respect which the Commission supports. However, we have to achieve a system which prevents these costs from being as high as they are at the moment and we must therefore set up common standards allowing us to deal with any difficulties which may arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for this report. It is an important element in the whole process of the introduction of the euro and I hope to carry on discussing this issue with you as we have done to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
