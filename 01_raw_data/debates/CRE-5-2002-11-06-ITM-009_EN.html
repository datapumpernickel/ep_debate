It would be a mistake, however, to confuse this funding stability with the status quo of the CAP. There are four reasons for this:</p>
<p class="contents">- the first is that the CAP in its current form runs counter to the multifunctional approach to farming, which requires a substantial strengthening of its second pillar. And, unless this is achieved by means of transferring funds from the first pillar, I fail to see where we will find the resources to pay for this in the context of enlargement to 25, 27 and later perhaps even to 28 States;</p>
<p class="contents">- the second reason is that defending the status quo of the blue box in WTO negotiations will cost us very dear. The price we might have to pay could be to make concessions on issues as important as access to the market, the protection of denominations of origin and even our own aid from the blue box;</p>
<p class="contents">- the third reason is that we have, under the CAP, a system of aid that is truly schizophrenic. In other words, it provides aid for some farmers but denies it to others. This is unsustainable in the long term and must be changed for a system of aid that does not discriminate between products and producers and which remedies this imbalance;</p>
<p class="contents">- the fourth reason for taking action is that the current system of aid is too complicated to be applied in a Union of 25 or 27 members. I believe that it would be preferable to undertake a balanced reform now, before 2004, which guarantees that the markets and their regulatory instruments will be managed, which guarantees Community preference and which guarantees aid for farmers, rather than to do so after enlargement, with the inherent risks of uncertainty about the negotiating and decision-making procedures in the first few years of the enlarged Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is urgently in need of reform if we are going to make a success of enlargement and of our commitment to open our markets to under-developed countries. Given the recent attitudes of the Council, the European Parliament has a heavy responsibility to give strong support to the Commission's proposals for a mid-term review. These, though not perfect, point in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Further market reform, with the decoupling of direct payments from production and the reinforcement of rural development, is most welcome. The proposals will put us in a stronger position in the World Trade Organisation negotiations. However, our Agriculture Committee is dominated by farmers and farmers' interests and it is blinded by two obsessions. The first is for protection against imported food and the second is for a guaranteed annual subsidy to be available to the farming industry as a whole. The concept of a really competitive European agriculture in the world market without subsidy is far from the Committee's thinking. The resolution pays lip service to reform but attaches so many conditions that I doubt whether the needs of enlargement, nor our obligations under the WTO, could be met.</p>
<p class="contents">The agricultural policies should be redirected so that they encourage farmers to be more enterprising. Whatever financial assistance is given should not be seen as a right. It must be earned and in a manner that the public can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to have seen the Commission proposals go further. We need to move towards world market prices by progressively reducing direct payments, we need to end quotas and make sure that the annual budget actually starts to reduce. It is ridiculous that 50% of our Community budget should be spent on a declining contribution to our GDP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission’s draft mid-term review of agricultural policy is a sound basis for embarking upon the discussions of a future reform of the EU’s agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on long-term funding, taken at the Brussels Summit, creates the background for enlargement. That is good and is something on which the Presidency should be commended. Any reform should be centred on farmers and consumers. It should be dynamic, and it should be a continuation of the liberalisation begun at the Berlin Summit in 1999. It should cover adjustments in response to the market economy and to world market prices and also, therefore, a curtailment of, and change to, the familiar policy of subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">The period up until 2006 should therefore be used for preparing a reform of the EU’s agricultural policy that makes European farmers competitive in the future world market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's proposals are a basis for discussions after 2007, as a whole raft of issues and problems correctly identified in the paper remain to be resolved. Nevertheless, the common agricultural policy was successful, and those elements that made it successful still need to be defended. I am quite convinced that there will be major debates on the decisions reached by the Heads of State and Government in Brussels as regards how to deal with future expenditure under EU agricultural policy within the predetermined financial framework and including the ten candidate countries. Looked at in that light, the motion for a resolution is just a snapshot and not a reform paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Freezing the agriculture budget at its 2006 level as from 2007 means an annual cut in agricultural support for farmers in the existing Member States, which will be hard or even impossible to achieve in 2003, the year before the elections. It will not be possible to reach a consensus to the effect that farmers should meet the cost of enlargement, yet it looks suspiciously as if that is what is intended.</p>

However, this is not just Mr Daul's resolution, it has the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I hope that tomorrow it will have the support of the entire European Parliament. Your personal achievement has been to bring together the various different tendencies in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and to document the European Parliament's desire to have a voice in the reform process. I would ask you, President-in-Office, to convey this to the Council, please. The European Parliament wants codecision here. It wants codecision as regards debates about content and form, and it wants codecision as regards financial resources.</p>

We want codecision for both agricultural policy and finance. You were wise enough not to cap pillar two, because we would not have found that acceptable, but we need to achieve a situation in which the European Parliament also has sovereignty over finances in pillar one, and can also decide what the basic features of the agricultural policy are.

His proposals for reform were complemented by an equally thoughtful response from Parliament's Agriculture Committee and I join the previous speaker in complimenting the Chairman of our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">To some extent this debate has now been superseded by the decision of the Heads of State to adhere to the decisions taken in Berlin. I have made the point on the number of occasions in this House that one of the greatest difficulties experienced by farmers is uncertainty – not being able to plan, even in the short term, for the development of their farms. Berlin was interpreted by farmers as setting the agricultural agenda, without adjustment, to 2006, and for this reason I believe the recent decision by the Heads of State was correct and restores to some degree of normality what was becoming a contentious issue for farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome, in particular, the more long-term budgetary assurances to 2013 but feel that the 1% inflation provision should at least be index-linked.

But decoupling direct payments can also have its disadvantages. If high land prices mean that young farmers are then unable to take over businesses, we have overshot the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, Commissioner Fischler has been overtaken to the right by Mr Schröder’s and Mr Chirac’s pre-arranged decisions at the Brussels Summit. What remains of the Commissioner’s plans to give rural policy more elbow room via a shift in funds?</p>
<p class="contents">If the CAP budget is frozen, this means an irrevocable drop in direct payments. Yesterday, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Fischler noted that we cannot subject the farmers to a drop of more than 3% per annum in income allowances. In this respect, the farmers have more to expect from the realism of this Commissioner than of many a minister who says that policy reforms are unnecessary but for all that freezes the budget within an enlarging Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is not and cannot be how to improve the subsidy system – it is the subsidies which are the problem. The question we must ask is why – if there is still a reason – we should continue to operate an immense protectionist system which works against the interests of European consumers and penalises the farmers of poorer countries shamefully.</p>
<p class="contents">What sense is there in over 40% of the European budget being used to subsidise agriculture which is worth on average 2% of GDP and employs 5% of the European workforce in a system which fosters waste, fraud, inefficiency and pollution? On the one hand, the European citizens pay over EUR 40 billion per year into the CAP budget, and, on the other, each citizen spends over EUR 300 buying farm produce, which is EUR 300 more than they would have to spend if we did not have the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the protectionist European agricultural system is systematically destroying the chances of hundreds of millions of people of freeing themselves from poverty, in that they are excluded from both the European markets and the markets of other countries, which are dependent upon subsidised exports.</p>
<p class="contents">We must shout out loud and clear that the European and US agricultural protectionist policies are a scandal and that, while the wealthy countries are giving the developing countries EUR 50 billion in aid, these policies alone are costing these same countries EUR 100 billion. This is what we must discuss in our debates, not just decoupling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that the Commission has presented this review on schedule, and I would specifically like to express my thanks for its forward-looking nature. However, I would like to stress and reiterate what the Commissioner told us – we should view this paper as a basis for a debate, a debate which we are all called upon to participate in.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a broadly based approach to reform. There is still a substantial need for clarification and debate in many areas. The Brussels Summit on 24 and 25 October set the financial framework up to 2013. We now need to establish in good time what shape the agricultural policy of the enlarged Community should take. Mr Daul's motion for a resolution was voted on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development after lengthy discussions between all the groups and many amendments. I would like to thank Mr Daul for his outstanding work and for his willingness to compromise. That is why I ask my fellow Members to vote for this motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need to go into all that much detail today. I hope we will have sufficient opportunities to do that at a later stage. However, there are a few important points I would like to touch upon briefly. The idea of decoupling aids and cutting red tape sounds appealing. However, I cannot imagine either working in practice. We are talking about money for farming families and that means that there must be fair and measurable criteria for distribution. It seems to me that basing the future of our agricultural policy on historical values, as the Commission is proposing, is not very forward-looking. As regards rules, commitments and audits the Commission should be proposing a simple and efficient procedure for such audits. The idea of burdening farms with new and unnecessary formalities and costs is not acceptable. I hope that in December we will have an opportunity to discuss concrete proposals from the Commission on market organisations.</p>

Consensus would never have been reached however, without the wonderful work of Mr Daul, the Chairman of the Committee. I would like to thank him for all he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the resolution all the political groups demonstrate their support for reform of the common agricultural policy, a reform which we all deem necessary. We welcome and support its objectives. It is vital that the second pillar of the CAP is strengthened as regards the budget, by transferring funds from the first to the second pillar. Strengthening the second pillar, and extending its scope to food safety and quality, are certainly very positive moves. In addition, the reform envisages the dynamic adjustment of funds in accordance with the criteria for social and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, some very worrying elements remain. The compulsory adjustment proposed in the reform does not constitute true adjustment. Rather, it is an across-the-board reduction in aid which I cannot support. We are very concerned about the principle of decoupling aid. The notion of a reference period cannot be used to establish single payment and decoupling. If that were to happen, it would amount to doing away with the use of this instrument to distribute the support provided by the CAP more fairly, given that the policy has created profound differences between farming areas and farmers across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Following our debate on the Council’s agreement, reform is all the more necessary. It is not possible for all farmers to pay in equal measure for the reduction in the budget for agriculture. The 5% of farmers who received 50% of direct aid in 2001 might cope with this reduction but the small and medium-sized farmers certainly cannot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My sincere thanks to you, then, Mr Daul. The EU’s agricultural policy is now in a very special and difficult situation, in turmoil, in fact, with the approach of enlargement and in the context of the current WTO negotiations. For that reason, it is very important for us to be able to establish a very stable agricultural policy, one that trusts in and has faith in the future, especially as enlargement is also now a key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In their future proposals for regulations, the Commission should present criteria that take account of impediments due to difficult natural conditions as well as what is needed for the implementation of environmental programmes. The basis of environmental action, in particular, must be the reinforcement of existing programmes. The programmes need flexibility, for example, in determining levels of financing, so that Member States can decide how much funding they need for different actions with reference to their own individual circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will have a tragic impact on the already severely eroded income of small and medium-sized producers, who will be forced to abandon the sector, causing agricultural production to shrink and eroding standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the Brussels Summit to freeze EU agricultural expenditure at pre-2006 levels until 2013, enhanced by 1% per annum in inflation provision, translates directly into a reduction in appropriations. This is because they will be divided between 25 countries and because the allowance for inflation has deliberately been pitched low. Inflation is already twice that and is expected to rise once the 10 new countries join. The way in which the CAP is being applied to the candidate countries is totally discriminatory, with direct subsidies being meted out at a rate of 25% in the first year, rising to 100% in 2013, in other words when subsidies will be worthless.</p>

I would first like to highlight the importance of this draft resolution, approved by the Committee on Agriculture. It is the result of the efforts made by all the political groups to reach a consensus on the common agricultural policy, in which so many different interests are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right therefore that we congratulate the members of the Committee on Agriculture, those who coordinated the work, and especially Mr Daul, the Chairman and author of this proposal. I trust the Council and the Commission will also take these conclusions into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Many queries could be raised regarding the proposal for a progress report. However, given the time constraints, I will concentrate on the question that concerns me most as citizen of a southern European country, namely the so-called decoupling of aid. In my country production is low and farmers have to contend with very difficult conditions. Firstly, the proposal does not envisage a genuine decoupling of aid, as it links aid to that received over the past few years, thus linking aid to past production. The only change is that farmers are not required to produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because farmers are not required to produce, there is the risk that they will give up farming in difficult areas where yields are low, leading to a real decline in rural areas where we are seeking to encourage development. We must not forget that the driving force behind rural development is production. Aid is welcome, but it is simply aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 7 has been included in the resolution to address this issue. It states that partially decoupled aid is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to explain that farmers have been working on the assumption that the goal posts would remain in place until 2006. This reform, termed the progress report, would have the effect of moving the goal posts before 2006. I think this will create great insecurity within a sector that is already beset by a number of other threats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like many of the previous speakers, I fundamentally welcome the fact that the European agricultural model is to be extended to a multifunctional agricultural sector in the enlarged European Union. This requires qualified external protection, and within the EU we still need markets to be regulated. However, although I fundamentally view the Franco-German unity that has emerged in the run-up to enlargement as a good thing, it does raise some issues for me. Although taxpayers and farmers already know how much money is to be spent up to 2013, they do not know on what. Germany's position as a net contributor will worsen simply because Germany's Federal Chancellor has locked us into the agreed financial framework for the agricultural policy from 2006 to 2013, with 25 countries. As we have heard again and again, and as the Commissioner has also told us, the reduction in compensation payments needed after 2006 will mean that less money will go to the agricultural sector than does now, and that applies particularly to Germany. I simply want to make that criticism clear. Incidentally, our Chancellor is not renowned for being the German farmers' friend!</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner for agriculture has put the net contribution to be made by the EU's farmers to financing enlargement at EUR 500 million in 2013. This amounts to the difference between the additional costs resulting from direct payments for the new Member States and the increase in agricultural expenditure approved by the EU Summit. This Commission calculation indicates to me that Europe's farmers will have to pay the lion's share of the burden of enlargement. The Commissioner for agriculture has repeatedly presented it as something positive that the Brussels Summit did not cap resources for rural development – that is to say, for the second pillar – but he can also tell us …</p>

I would like first to thank Mr Daul for the conciliatory work he has undertaken in the difficult task of moving this resolution forward. The resolution is the result of a great effort especially on his part and also on the part of all the political groups. Parliament should not introduce any changes as this could threaten the consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels Summit clarified many of the unknown quantities, especially as regards the ceiling on spending. However, doubts remain on the content of the CAP review. These will not be resolved until the Commission presents its legislative proposals to us. Therefore, I think it is truly important that we, as members of all the political groups represented in this document, send out a strong message tomorrow. It must be a strong, clear and direct message in support of farmers. We need to say to the farmers that although the common agricultural policy must be revised, we will ensure this is done in the best possible way, within the scope of the funds allocated up to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the two central strands I have identified in the review, the one that really worries me is the decoupling of aid, as some Members have already mentioned. If this is carried out as proposed, I think the CAP would be holed below its waterline. We need to think long and hard about this. I think that the partial decoupling as proposed by the consensus reached through Mr Daul is a step in the right direction, but we could still examine these issues further and in greater depth.</p>

It is a courageous undertaking, and the transfer of some of the resources supporting the market precisely to the poorer rural areas is timely and positive. As always, when one person benefits, many others suffer. The previous speakers have already mentioned the reasons for regretting decoupling and other technical aspects, which I will not repeat. I would, instead, like to focus on the positive side of these innovations, this courageous step, to address a point which is, I am sad to say, too often disregarded. In actual fact, this openness bodes extremely well for all those who are advocates of development in the outermost regions, particularly mountain regions. This section on rural development is extremely important but its importance is equally greatly overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">The word ‘mountain’ does not appear in the Commissioner’s mid-term review, even though, just a couple of weeks ago, he dedicated a two-day seminar to mountain issues. As always, however, the debate was opened and closed without any progress being made. The word ‘mountain’ does not appear in the document we are discussing either, but mountain issues can quite easily be identified in Mr Daul’s document. I congratulate Mr Daul heartily. For example, paragraph 1 of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s motion for resolution calls for the development of multifunctional farming. Mountain farming is a diverse and multifunctional typical form of farming. Paragraph 3, which calls for a more precise definition of the objectives of protection of the environment, public health and animal welfare, describes what have always been the parameters of mountain farming, what I would call endemic mountain farming. Above all, however, mountains are implicit in the section on rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 17 calls for a range of measures differing according to the different types of farming regions. Again, paragraph 18 states that it is essential to preserve traditional family farms and support young farmers in less-favoured areas and the outermost regions. I regret to say that the remote location of mountain areas means that they are always outermost regions and certainly less favoured than the plains. Lastly, paragraph 20 calls upon the Commission to give priority in the distribution pattern to the less-favoured regions, to the regions which are most vulnerable and in need – I would add – not just of development plans but of an investment of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation of the European mountain regions, which make up 30% of Europe’s territory and are home to 5% of its population. The mountains do not want to be a problem. They want their great potential to be a major resource for the whole Union. We must decide to call them by their name. We must have no hesitation in acknowledging their specific situation and, what is more, mention them by name in the new Treaty to give them an anchor and provide a legal basis on which to draw up an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> directive. We must start work on a document which provides specifically and exclusively for the needs of the mountain regions. This could be the start of a radical reform which would improve the situation of the mountain regions and all the less-favoured regions, giving them the same opportunities for life and growth as the rest of the Community.</p>

Commissioner Fischler also assured Luxembourg on that occasion that he considered we had implemented the concept of rural development in an exemplary fashion, and in this respect he even said that nowhere else had EU resources been better invested. That is all very well and good.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, once the legislative proposals reflecting these ideas for reform are on the table, we will find out just how much we can rely on those statements. In Luxembourg, 70% of farms would be affected by the modulation proposed, that is to say by the progressive reduction in compensation payments by one-fifth, in addition to the expected drop in income because of cuts in producer prices and because of the mandatory 10% ‘environmental set-aside’. This is unacceptable and would lead to the socially and environmentally unacceptable demise of family farms. Proposals that would achieve eastward enlargement by wiping out farmers belong in one place – the rubbish bin. I am able to vote for the compromise resolution that Joseph Daul has invested so much time and understanding in, even if it is with a heavy heart, Joseph! The summit on 25 October agreed, thank goodness, that the common agricultural policy agreed in 2000 in Berlin up to 2006 would not be undermined by any radical changes before then. So we and the Commission have time to reflect. In any case, less favoured regions should be exempt both from the modulation and also from mandatory environmental set-aside. In conclusion, I would like to …</p>

I want also again to thank the European Parliament for its reading of the Commission’s communication, and I understand that a decision may be made at the meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if I might be permitted to concur in the praise accorded at the meeting here this evening to the chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I of course appreciate from the debate that the European Parliament has just as many approaches to European agricultural policy as I encounter in the Council of Ministers, and I therefore fully appreciate the difficulties that Mr Daul has been so extremely good at negotiating, as is apparent from the proposal now due to be voted on.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people touched upon the issue of the prospects for reforming agricultural policy following the Brussels Summit. How will the policy eventually look? How long will the reforms take? There are many outstanding issues but, with the conclusions adopted at the Brussels Summit, the European Council has clarified matters regarding the maximum expenditure on the market-related area and direct payments for the budget period up to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to draw attention to section 12, generally, of the conclusions, which in actual fact says three different things.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it anticipates ceilings set for expenditure for market-related expenditure and direct payments, and not future decisions on the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it does not anticipate possible results following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the Berlin European Council conclusions. Paragraph 22 of the conclusions is the background to the mid-term review of agricultural policy, which we discussed at the most recent meetings of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and as a response, too, to some of the questions raised this evening – what is stated is without prejudice to the international commitments entered into by the European Union, for example in the launching of the next Doha Round, the ways and means of which are to be in place before the end of March of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">As I also said in my first contribution, the negotiations in each of the three areas mentioned are continuing and will not necessarily be influenced by the fact that the European Council has now set a ceiling for the expenditure up until 2013. I shall not at this stage weary MEPs with a report on the Council’s view of developments, but how far we get – and that is of course what is exciting and interesting: how far will we get in the individual areas? – completely depends upon the wishes of the individual Member States and upon what we can agree to in the Council of Ministers. Exciting tasks still lie ahead, therefore, and we look forward to completing these.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, however, again to say thank you for the sound cooperation we have had with the European Parliament. I hope that this will continue in the further discussions of the development of a European agricultural policy, to the satisfaction and benefit of both producers and consumers.</p>

<p class="contents">And why? Because overall subsidies in the agricultural sector will increase by 8% between 2006 and 2013, in the form of a minimal inflation provision.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to set this disturbing increase against a number of other post-enlargement increases in the EU, so as to give a more in-depth picture of future developments.</p>

This is due to the stress of their uncertain future. The reform of the CAP, however, only increases this uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">After 2006, therefore, will twenty-five States be able to survive on an agricultural budget that was designed for just 15 and has not been changed? After the WTO Summit in Cancun in September 2003, what will become of the internal and export aid criticised by the line adopted in Doha?</p>
<p class="contents">Granting the European Parliament competence for agricultural codecision and giving this House the final say on the agriculture budget, which stipulates that spending for our small farmers would no longer be mandatory, is placing European farmers in the hands of a majority of our fellow Members who, as we all know, are ultra-liberal, in favour of free trade and against small farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">We can no longer accept that the future of small farmers should be at the mercy of Anglo-Saxon liberal fundamentalists who are the equivalent of Al Qaida in the crazy religion of trade. Moreover, I am not talking about the uncertainty that will result, in the draft of the new CAP, from decoupling production revenue, modulation or bureaucratic audits.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, when so many questions remain unanswered, our small farmers cannot plan their investments and their future. We must not allow our small farmers to be plunged into this abyss. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
