<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Koukiadis (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did me the honour of asking me to draft an own-initiative report on legal bases and compliance with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The title of the report is not accurate. I would say it is slightly misleading. It is in fact about the huge issue which is troubling the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament with contradictory positions and which has to do with investigating potential legal bases for the jurisdiction of the European Union to make provision for criminal sanctions for certain serious violations of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a large divergence of opinion about if and to what extent this sort of activity can be legislated. In order, therefore, for us to have a substantiated report, I proposed and the Commission agreed to hold a public hearing with rapporteurs expressing the various tendencies. I should like to express my thanks for their contribution and to inform the House that the report was based on the points on which we appear to more or less agree. The common objective of all of us must be the effective application of Community provisions, but with solutions which will be reliable, because our main concern is to create legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you that the issue of criminal sanctions for serious infringements of Community law was also raised in the past in connection with legislative proposals concerning environmental protection, protection of the Community’s financial interests, safeguarding intellectual property rights, pollution at sea and pollution offences in general.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a rather complicated issue from a legal point of view. It is further complicated by the distinction between the three pillars. The report concentrates on the issue of legislating criminal sanctions in the first pillar. In order to make the problem understandable, I have confined myself to raising the basic question to which the report gives a positive answer, in other words the extent to which the Community can impose an obligation on the Member States to make provision for criminal sanctions for serious infringements of Community law. This is the so-called mixed method, whereby the Community imposes an obligation on the Member States to make provision for criminal sanctions for this specific issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We confined ourselves to this method because it appears to attract a great deal of agreement. By contrast, the purely Community method of making direct provision for criminal sanctions under Community law, a sort of communitisation of criminal law, comes up against serious legal objections which start from the fact that there is no clear legal basis in the Treaty for this issue, that criminal sanctions form part of the national sovereignty of the Member States and that criminal justice is an integral part of national culture. In addition, the objection is also advanced that criminal sanctions are linked to restrictions on individual rights, which presupposes a fully constitutionally coordinated state, not an imperfect legal order with the obvious financial elements and democratic deficit of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, even if the purely Community method were accepted, it would be confined to making provision for one criminal sanction. It does not appear to have jurisdiction to impose the sanction in this specific case. As regards the so-called national method, which means the right of the states to make provision for criminal sanctions for cases of infringement of Community law, this does not create problems. The states are at liberty to follow this method. However, the sanction needs to be of an effective, proportionate and deterrent nature. It would even become clear that it was not thus concerned with the issue of the harmonisation of criminal law and sanctions, for which only the third pillar can be used and only in specific cases. With the constitution being drafted, these issues will have a new basis. The position of the report on the basic question I referred to above, in other words if the Community can impose an obligation on the Member States to make provision for criminal sanctions, is that the Community legislator has the legal capacity to demand this of the Member States. To be specific, it accepts the principle of safeguarding the law formulated in Article 10 of the EC Treaty; in other words, the obligation of the Member States to ensure that violations of Community law attract effective criminal sanctions. Consequently, as we acknowledge such an obligation on the part of the states, we should also acknowledge the Community legislator’s capacity to make provision for similar obligations, at least for serious infringements of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the report clarifies that, in order for such a Community initiative to be legal with the law as it stands, it must only be exercised in cases in which this is the only way to safeguard effective compliance with Community provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report also proposes that the European Commission, in its capacity as guardian of Community interests, should be able to lodge complaints or bring civil actions, at least in cases where the Member States are accorded an equivalent right. It is encouraging that the Constitutional Convention is on the same wavelength, with final proposals from the motion for the resolution, as can be seen from articles Ι-13, ΙΙΙ-65 and ΙΙΙ-172. Once the new Treaty applies, we shall have to re-examine this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Commission wishes first of all to acknowledge the high quality of Mr Koukiadis's report, which constitutes a valuable working document on the sensitive relationship between criminal sanctions and Community law. Furthermore, this report has the merit of being the first institutional document to give a complete overview of this problem which, admittedly, is nothing new. The Commission services are moreover keen to approach it through various different working documents when each, or almost each, of the proposals mentioned in Mr Koukiadis's report is tabled, in particular those on the protection of the Community's financial interests, the protection of the environment through criminal law, racism and xenophobia, subjects which had never before been dealt with as systematically outside the world of academia.</p>
<p class="contents">The second cause that I have to be glad on the Commission's behalf is the fact that, reading the report, I see that many of the views expressed in it overlap with the position held by the Commission. Like Mr Koukiadis, the Commission does not consider the Community to have a general competence in criminal matters as the treaties currently stand.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission believes that the functional competences that it has for the purposes of meeting the objectives set out in Article 2 of the EC Treaty do make the Community competent to impose an obligation on the Member States to lay down sanctions, and if need be criminal sanctions, if this proves to be necessary to reach a Community objective. This approach is based, as Mr Koukiadis has noted, on the case law of the Court of Justice, according to which Article 10 of the Treaty – and I quote – 'requires the Member States to take all measures necessary to guarantee the application and effectiveness of Community law'.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as the treaties currently stand, the harmonisation of Member States' criminal law can be governed only by the provisions of Title 6 of the Treaty on European Union. Moreover, this is the position that the Commission, supported by Parliament, is defending before the Court of Justice in the action disputing the legality of the framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as I see it, Mr Koukiadis's report and, in particular, its conclusions have the enormous merit of illustrating perfectly the extent to which the interweaving of the policies in the first Community pillar and the courses of action that are said to come under the third pillar is a source of constant difficulty. Furthermore there is an inherent risk in this situation of blocking the decision-making process. The price that we pay to overcome these difficulties is to make artificial divisions between legislation that has the same purpose, which can often render the Union's activities largely incomprehensible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is important that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice are recognised as playing an identical role to the one that they play in the first pillar; in this way our concern to be effective can go hand in hand with improving democratic and legal checks and measures. That is why the Commission welcomes the proposal to bring Title 6 of the Treaty on European Union within the Community system as such, as recommended by the Convention. The Commission will do its utmost to ensure that this major step forward survives the Intergovernmental Conference, which will be starting next month. I know that in this regard Parliament is entirely in agreement with the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report takes real care to specify the details of such a delicate issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The report quite rightly separates the specific notions from what is the essential notion for the Community's action by asking the Member States to establish penalties, where necessary. That notion is the duty of loyalty enshrined in Article 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It also takes care to stress – as the Commission has just done – the peculiar (to put it mildly) situation represented by the twin possibility of using, on the hand, Title VI and, on the other, the first pillar. It insists, furthermore – as Parliament has always done and as is quite right – that, wherever possible, the first pillar should be used. This is, moreover, without prejudice – as the Commissioner has also just stressed – to the great progress represented by the establishment in the European Constitution of the disappearance – formally at least – of the pillars and of an approximation of the third pillar to the characteristics of the first pillar. This is an issue which – and I fully agree with Commissioner Bolkestein – we must try to maintain during the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports this text by Mr Koukiadis which, furthermore, has been very flexible by stipulating two of the points on which we asked, definitively, for an application of the principle of proportionality. In other words, application of penalties is not demanded if the same end can be achieved by means of other legal instruments. In certain cases it will be necessary to use penalties, but we must always try to ensure that the law does not apply the most serious penalty if the objective can be achieved by means of the least serious one. This has been suitably taken up by Mr Koukiadis in his report and I would like to thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe we are left with a balanced report, a report which reflects the constant concern of the Commission and of this Parliament that Community law should not be a <span class="italic">flatus vocis</span>, that it should be an effective law, and there can be no effective law without penalties, without the possibility of demanding compliance with the law by means of relevant actions in the event that it is violated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and I am confident that a vast majority of this Parliament will vote in favour of the text of his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very timely and well-produced report on what, as has already been said, is a very complex and sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is complex it is an issue to which we have to take a practical approach. There have been times in our committee when we have been presented with initiatives from the Member States, where they want us to introduce penalties, but we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot respond as they would like. Bearing that situation in mind, when it comes to the IGC, the Council and Member States will appreciate the good sense of what is being proposed here.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also struck by the idea presented to us – at the enlightening hearing with experts when Mr Koukiadis was preparing this report – that the Community should and must have the wherewithal to protect its own property in the widest sense. That is what we are talking about: property in its widest sense.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is one point I would like to make and underline. If we are to give the Community power in this area of competence – and we should – then it should also be underpinned by the sort of balance achieved by the Community itself signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights. If we are to have some competence, albeit limited, in the criminal field, this must be balanced by measuring that legislation against something fundamental and basic that guarantees our citizens' human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just want to quickly address three principles.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is obvious that criminal law and criminal sanctions touch the liberty of citizens more closely than any other branch of the law and therefore, being absolutely certain that there is a valid constitutional basis for the use of criminal law is vital to liberty as a fundamental matter of the rule of law. One of the things that the report and its explanatory statement do is to show exactly to what extent there is a basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in a democratic Community, it is essential that the citizens' representatives get to vote on the question of whether the criminal law should be extended. That alone would cause us to regard Pillar III as a very suspect basis for any kind of intervention in the criminal law. It effectively excludes the democratic representatives of the citizens in this Parliament beforehand and in the national parliaments afterwards. Therefore it is excellent to discover, as Mr Koukiadis shows, that it is a matter for the Community Pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">I should to like to underline the point in paragraph 7 about subsidiarity and proportionality. Again, it sends a message to the Member States to improve their criminal law in an appropriate way and to allow sensitivity to local traditions in law. That is absolutely vital. Those are three important principles in an excellent report.</p>

As Mr MacCormick said – and I welcome him back to Strasbourg after our two meetings in Edinburgh – we all agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallis raised the issue of the signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights. That is a very good point. Some have proposed that instead of having this Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now in existence and which will probably be part of the new Constitution – although some disagree about that – we should merely have signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights. There is a risk in the present situation that there is a sort of competition between the two instruments. That debate has taken place, but the decision – as Mrs Wallis knows – was finally taken to have a Charter of Fundamental Rights. The question now is whether it would be useful to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights, in addition to having that charter. I am wary of duplicating instruments, so I wonder whether Mrs Wallis' suggestion is a good one. However, it is certainly worth considering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
