<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lisi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we received with great interest the Commission communication on a Community Action Plan for fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea. This communication responds to a frequently expressed demand which is wholly legitimate, given both the importance of the Mediterranean fishing economy for the European Union and the specific nature of fisheries in the Mediterranean region. The current regulation on fisheries in the Mediterranean – Regulation 1626/94 – has thus far survived only thanks to derogations which, although, on the one hand, have made it possible to save the unsaveable, as in the case of special fisheries, have, on the other, served first and foremost to highlight the inadequacy of the Union’s approach to the Mediterranean question. Indeed, we all know that applying the principles of the common fisheries policy exactly as it stands is counterproductive to the Mediterranean and can even, at times, be harmful if we consider the socio-economic consequences. That is why I welcome with particular satisfaction the Commission’s endeavour, this endeavour to establish the specific nature of the Mediterranean and the sustainability of fisheries resources as new criteria in the future action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many positive aspects of the communication, such as, for example, the delegation to the Member States of responsibility for managing coastal fishing, the involvement of fishermen’s associations, dialogue with third countries and the consideration given for the first time to leisure fishing. Nevertheless, following a proper analysis of the sector and its specific characteristics carried out by the Commission with regard to the solutions, the rapporteur and our Parliamentary committee feel that not enough effort has been made to find imaginative solutions and avoid recourse to conventional CFP – common policy – instruments, whereas, for the Mediterranean we need an innovative, coherent, step-by-step measure whose thrust can be altered whenever it is deemed necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to draw your attention briefly to a number of points contained in my report. Firstly, the Union’s systematic, multilateral approach must be a reality, not just wishful thinking. Involving fishermen’s associations must include promoting the experiments carried out at local level with a view to responsible management, experiments which demonstrate the effectiveness of the selective equipment used and the effectiveness of alternative ways of managing the fishing effort, such as, for example, temporary closures. Rigidly and systematically transposing CFP management mechanisms such as minimum sizes or TACs is liable to negate fishermen’s determined efforts and could prove to be counterproductive. Moreover, premature implementation of inadequate technical measures would be liable to render ineffective the multilateral dialogue which the Commission plans to hold with the third countries of the Mediterranean region with a view to the sustainable management of the Basin as a whole. What we want is for the negotiations with countries which, like us, fish the Mediterranean Sea to be undertaken as soon as possible, so that we can submit the results of these talks to the forthcoming Mediterranean Interministerial Conference on fisheries due to take place in Venice in November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the emphasis placed on the fundamental role of research to support an effective fisheries policy. As we know, from this point of view, the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean have always represented a problem, but we must emphasise the need for scientific research to be relevant to the action plan. It is in this regard that we propose a Mediterranean research model based on local data-collection networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the structural implications of the action plan, which we feel the Commission has underestimated somewhat. In particular, we consider the part dedicated to this point to be unsatisfactory. As a committee, we propose to evaluate, in cases such as this one, not least, innovative support measures, particularly the measure extending the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rule to the fisheries sector. It must certainly not be forgotten that 80% of Mediterranean fishing is small-scale and tied closely to the areas concerned, whose socio-economic equilibrium verges, more often than not, on mere subsistence.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, there is the line taken by the Commission on the environment. It appears to us to be somewhat incomplete in that it does not acknowledge that fishermen are more often victims of, rather than responsible for, environmental damage. In a region where genuinely coastal fishing predominates, the key to sustainable coexistence remains, in any case, the integrated management of coastal areas, an aspect to which the Commission fails to give sufficient emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by thanking my colleagues from the Committee on Fisheries for their extremely helpful suggestions, which allowed us ultimately to achieve unanimous consensus on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I am pleased to see that Parliament endorses the approach proposed by the Commission. It is true, as is highlighted in the report, that the Commission has conceived an ambitious plan, but this is warranted by the importance and complexity of Mediterranean fisheries. The Community must do its utmost to deliver sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Many fishermen's associations, public opinion and the European Parliament too have repeatedly requested a more stringent, reliable and strategic common fisheries policy in the Mediterranean. The plan will respond to this challenge and, if properly implemented and supported by our Member States, it will allow us to achieve the main goal of reconciling fisheries with conservation of exploited resources and the environment within a framework of economic and social sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">We are worried about the state of resources and sustainability of fisheries in the area. Both the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of the Commission have underlined the poor state of some of the species in the area. There are clear signals that the fisheries are not properly exploiting the production potential of the resources. In addition, the poor economic performance of several important Mediterranean fleets means that the current exploitation pattern needs to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will make use of all the management tools available on the basis of scientific advice. Even though effort management, together with improved control of fishing capacity, is likely to be the most appropriate tool for Mediterranean fisheries, it is undeniable that improving technical measures is also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already started work on a proposal to improve the technical measures to achieve better protection of juveniles, of habitats and, in general terms, of biodiversity. We have already convened two meetings on 19 May and 16-17 June 2003 to discuss this measure with the fishing industry. Improved dialogue with the industry will allow the Commission to adopt quite soon a proposal on technical measures that takes into consideration the expertise of the sector. Immediately after the adoption of the technical measures package, the Commission will start to address the fishing effort issue and I hope that a formal proposal could be put forward early in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are well aware that all our efforts could be wasted if we do not establish cooperative management with the other Mediterranean countries. There are many international waters with open access. In addition, the trawlable shelf extends well beyond territorial waters. This means that the Community must work together with Mediterranean third countries to establish harmonised measures and to freeze or reduce the fishing capacity operation in certain shared areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well advanced in the organisation of a ministerial conference in Venice scheduled for 25-26 November 2003. That should hopefully deliver a further boost to multilateral cooperation in fisheries. However, as the biggest fisheries player in the area, we have a responsibility to lead the process and to promote responsible fisheries, first of all, on our own side. Establishing so-called fishing protection zones is, in the Commission's view, a necessary move to improve control and fairness in international waters, as well as to create an international framework to deliver responsible fisheries and to ensure conservation of straddling and transnational stocks. This should enhance multilateral cooperation without prejudice to the historical rights of our fishermen and the legitimate aspirations of the other bordering countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, on the report he has prepared, and in particular on his will and his way of working, which has enabled the other members of the Committee on Fisheries, as he said himself, to enter into a fruitful and positive dialogue when drawing up this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean, which is the cradle of European civilisation, is a responsive, living, but extremely fragile place, characterised by its status as an enclosed sea, which brings its own dangers. There are therefore no easy solutions to problems such as industrial pollution – as the rapporteur himself pointed out – or pollution due to high demographic density. The Action Plan presented by the European Commission is necessary. We need an all-embracing Action Plan that is not restricted to fishing methods, because nobody could believe that the current scarcity of fish is due solely to overfishing. It is due rather to a combination of factors, mainly marine pollution due to agricultural pesticides reaching the sea, oil slicks and everyday leaks from oil tankers, and the lack of purifying plants for treating sewage.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urgently need to adopt measures o combat industrial and urban pollution in the Mediterranean. We also need to put a stop to the infringements of the common fisheries policy that currently take place, such as illegal fishing, the use of illegal methods, parallel trading and lack of compliance with standards relating to minimum size.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean fishing sector is fragile. Its fleet – as we have already heard – essentially comprises small-scale fishing boats. The sector therefore needs the continued support of the public authorities if it is to develop in a controlled manner without growth for some leading to bankruptcy for others. This applies equally to the small-scale fishing fleet, aquaculture – a growing industry – or marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has pointed out, the characteristics of the Mediterranean are highly specific. Around twenty countries – most of which are not EU Members – as well as world fleets operate in this area, such as the Japanese and Russian fleets. The Community needs to ensure, in conjunction with the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean, that all parties comply with the principles of the common fisheries policy with regard to the Mediterranean. Without sustainable management of resources, the days of fishing in the Mediterranean are numbered, as this area provides a livelihood for almost half the workers in the Community fishing sector and half the European fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lisi has pointed out, the fishing sector in the Mediterranean employs a large workforce and has a positive effect on other sectors, such as tourism. Poor application of the principle of subsidiarity – and this is perhaps the strongest objection I would put to Mr Lisi – resulting in the renationalisation of the CFP, would be a death sentence for fishing in the Mediterranean. I therefore believe we urgently need to apply the CFP in its entirety in the Mediterranean, adapting it to the reality of the Mediterranean situation and considering in advance, where we feel it necessary, what exactly are the prevailing conditions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to adapt the fleet to existing resources, but we cannot – and here I agree with Mr Lisi – sentence it to ruin, as might happen if aid for renovating the fleet was discontinued. The ageing of the fleet would lead to the end of fishing in the Mediterranean, as surely as if there were no more fish.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists – and I should make this clear – supports the Action Plan presented by the Commission, which should be implemented with the utmost regard for the special characteristics of the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A common fisheries policy (CFP) cannot, however, be blindly applied: it must take account of local and regional variations between different fisheries, fleets and regions of the Member States dependent on this sector, and the populations involved. For that reason, a degree of participation on the part of fishermen and their associations is essential. Their experience is vital. This requirement also means, however, that if the CFP is to be correctly applied, it is essential to guarantee flexibility for Member States in the application of measures for the management of the fishing effort. We must take into account experimental local projects developed by the fishermen themselves. The rapporteur mentions such projects in the Mediterranean. This also suggests that the Member States should be able to enforce conservation measures themselves, since it is they who know most about the state of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point relates to promoting research, since measures to conserve and evaluate the state of resources should be taken on the basis of sound scientific opinion, with the participation of fishermen and their associations. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to promote research, a step the rapporteur also proposes for the Mediterranean in his report. We are also in favour of delegating the responsibility for coastal and other fisheries management to Member States, as well as encouraging the discovery of solutions on a local level. The aim of this, with the principle of subsidiarity in mind, is to reduce the fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this is a good path to follow in other areas, such as the Atlantic. In Portugal, for example, as in the Mediterranean, small-scale coastal and non-industrial fishing is very important. While I concur with the rapporteur’s argument that we need to take measures specifically to support such fishing, just as I argued for that need when the 2003 fisheries budget appeared, I would emphasise the need for the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance to help small-scale fishing. I would also emphasise the importance of considering, for various parts of the Atlantic, and in particular for the 200-mile-long Portuguese coast and island territories, identical measures for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of salt-water fisheries resources to those I upheld for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise, as did the rapporteur, that the decline of fisheries has other causes, notably pollution and sea transport. The sector is therefore often a victim of these phenomena. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent quality of his work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean is a semi-enclosed sea. It forms an ecosystem, an entity in its own right, rich in its environment and in its culture. The problems involving the Mediterranean must be solved in the context of multilateral relations and the MEDA programmes, for which I am the rapporteur and which are true instruments of the European Union, set up by the 1995 Barcelona Convention, making it possible to take action from the point of view of sustainable development. MEDA must also take into account the economic, technical and environmental problems relating to fisheries. I should like to emphasise several points which are raised in Mr Lisi’s report and which I believe to be of major importance.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in order to gain a knowledge of the region, it is essential to carry out a survey of the environment, the treatment of waste water, the development of coastal belts and the development of fisheries resources. In order to do this, considerable investment will have to be agreed on rapidly, to enable scientific research programmes to be implemented concerning the state of fish stocks and the prospects for development as a function of pressure from fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, fishing techniques must be studied in order to decide which ones are most suitable, taking into account, in particular, the size of the fish, which are often smaller in the Mediterranean than elsewhere, and smaller fish do not necessarily mean juveniles.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must protect and promote small-scale fishing, by which I mean non-industrial fishing, which is often coastal fishing and which is an important source of jobs besides treating fisheries resources with greater care than industrial fishing does.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, fishing is an occupation with many motivated and competent people in responsible positions, people who are highly experienced and who are concerned with preserving the ethics of fishing, and who do not hesitate to share their extremely interesting local experiences so that lessons may be learned from them. Regional fisheries committees, which serve as centres of consultation, and which take into account the needs of the profession, should be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the Mediterranean Sea itself and the coastal lagoons, as well as the wetlands around them, we must seek to ensure greater respect for the environment so that fishing can continue to develop, particularly in the lagoons, such as the <span class="italic">Etang de Thau</span>, whose Category A status it is absolutely essential to preserve. Only in this way is it possible to allow the continuation of extensive fishing, constantly taking into account health criteria which correspond to an environment of excellent quality, thereby avoiding any deterioration which would certainly occur if we encouraged only activities taking place out of the water, in particular the cleaning of shellfish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what we have here are a series of good intentions which, although we do not fully support them, need to be implemented with some urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of points, rightly emphasised in Mr Lisi’s report – and I would like to congratulate Mr Lisi – are particularly important. The Commission rightly considers that one of the key elements to bear in mind, with a view to a sustainable approach to fisheries in the Mediterranean Basin, is the specific nature of the Mediterranean itself. Quite right. I would point out that the principal areas of reproduction and repopulation of many – not all – species of fish in the Mediterranean are concentrated in the coastal areas. On behalf of the UEN Group, I can therefore only welcome the European Commission’s proposal providing for delegation to the Member States of responsibility for managing coastal fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that another specific characteristic of the Mediterranean Sea – a relatively small, warm sea compared to the northern seas – is the fact that few single-species schools of fish are formed. Precisely for this reason – and here I am disassociating myself from the Commission’s proposal – I feel that the Mediterranean fisheries system does not lend itself to the effective implementation of TACs and quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the Commission’s line on enhancing and improving scientific research in the Mediterranean and involving fishermen’s associations in key decisions in the fisheries sector: these are points of primary importance which I am afraid it is not possible to go into in more depth here. I would, however, like to highlight the excellent proposal to allow professional organisations to participate in the future Advisory Council for the Mediterranean which we hope to see established.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, still on the subject of the specific nature of the Mediterranean, I would like to emphasise a point which is genuinely important and crucial for the sector’s economy, a point which certainly applies to Italy in any case. We must make every endeavour to support the small-scale fishing, the traditional fishing which, in addition to providing a vital source of employment for countless families, is the guardian of an age-old tradition which Europe must protect and safeguard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I apologise for being a bit croaky. I have made so many speeches over the last week I am losing my voice, although some people would regard that as a blessing.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I congratulate Giorgio Lisi for his excellent report. Embracing the Mediterranean within the controls and regulations of the common fisheries policy is a very ambitious plan and one which I hope will secure the core objectives of conservation and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to do so we first must learn the lesson from past failures of the common fisheries policy. We do not need to search far for these failures: for the past year we have been dealing with crisis after crisis. The Commission itself, in the opening lines of its CFP reform document, acknowledges that the policy has been deeply flawed. Where the main objective of the CFP has been to sustain employment in the sector and to sustain fish stocks we have failed miserably on both counts. We are now dealing with estimated job losses in excess of 40 000 around the North Sea alone, with hundreds of fishermen leaving the industry and scrapping their vessels, and fish stocks across the major whitefish species showing signs of imminent collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for these problems are of course manifold: overfishing has indeed played its part, but so have environmental pollution, global warming, North Atlantic drift, and many other factors. However, the strict regime of TACs and quotas has itself exacerbated the problem of discards, with over 25% of healthy fish being thrown dead back into the sea every year. A Commission official told our committee last week that an estimated 150 000 tonnes of fresh healthy haddock were dumped dead back into the North Sea last year. This is an utter tragedy and completely unsustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the problems of illegal fishing – black fish landings – have made the situation even worse. We must not allow these problems to be imported into the Mediterranean under the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have an initial difficulty – and a very large one at that – because the majority of countries fishing in the Mediterranean are not EU Member States, so we must seek their active cooperation in achieving our conservation and sustainable exploitation objectives. It would be untenable to impose a strict regime of regulations and controls on our own fleet while allowing vessels from other nations to plunder the seas unhindered. The very nature of the fishing sector around the Mediterranean is unique: few people realise for example that the Italian fleet is the second largest in the EU, with over 17 000 vessels. 98% of these, however, are under 12 metres in length, which means the main fishery is being prosecuted in inshore waters and is of a largely artisanal nature. Many of these craft are old and are becoming increasingly unsafe, so we need to look at the modernisation of these vessels on health and safety grounds alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the recommendations from Mr Lisi that we should closely monitor leisure fishing. This is an increasingly important area and it provides many jobs in the tourist sector, the value of which we cannot underestimate. It would be ludicrous, however, to ignore the impact such activities have on the fisheries sector and on fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am very much in favour of the multilateral approach to fisheries management in the Mediterranean in future. This is the only way in which we can involve all of the actors and stakeholders in the formulation of sensible management proposals for a sustainable Mediterranean fishery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The climatic, physical, cultural and political history of the Mediterranean is very rich and complex. I read recently that it dried up completely five thousand years ago, as demonstrated by the layers of salt on the sea floor. Admittedly, the pressures of tourism, the population explosion in northern Africa and pollution do not currently threaten this beautiful sea as gravely as did that climatic disaster which dried it up completely. There is nevertheless a risk of overfishing in many parts of the Mediterranean. The most rigorous scientific research says as much, though there is as yet no scientifically proven risk of a collapse in fish stocks. While there is admittedly no risk of collapse, then, there are threats nevertheless, and it is to be feared that resources in the Mediterranean may suffer the same decline as has occurred in other maritime regions. That is why it is necessary to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that delegating power and responsibility to Member States, as well as teasing out solutions at local level in order to reduce the fishing effort, is to be welcomed. It is a good principle, one which could eventually be applied at points on the Atlantic rim, such as the coast of Portugal, for example. The obstacles placed by the rapporteur in the way of implementing the main tools of conservation policy, however, especially total allowable catches (TAC) and quotas, raise some doubts in my mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The objections brought by the rapporteur to the introduction of minimum landing sizes are also debateable. The reference to the special character of Mediterranean fisheries is legitimate, but seems almost to have become for some a pretext for maintaining the current <span class="italic">status quo.</span> Research is the magic word, but it is also used to defer decisions that demand to be taken straight away. In point of fact, though, research must indeed be a priority for the European Union, and organisations under its umbrella, if errors are not to be made in future regarding the state of fisheries resources and marine biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">A more balanced and rational study of salt-water fisheries resources in the Mediterranean is needed. That much is indisputable. At this point, however, after hearing the speeches made by my fellow Members, I continue to entertain doubts about whether we should apply the current Atlantic common fisheries policy (CFP) to the Mediterranean, or whether we should, on the contrary, apply the Mediterranean model to the Atlantic … This is a highly controversial issue which we should perhaps examine in depth rather than superficially, since what has finally come to light today, after the speeches we have heard, is that the current CFP model is misguided, and the existing Mediterranean model is the one which may eventually come to be adopted. Is this claim true or false? It certainly constitutes a challenge. As the Commission says, the one thing of which we can now be certain is that the Mediterranean lacks regulations allowing the same levels of development to be achieved, and attaching the same high priority to this issue, as in other parts of the Community. It is not even true to say that a few specific elements are necessary. Who is right? This answer to this question is very important if we are to resolve doubts over whether some of the speeches made on the subject of the Mediterranean are not designed purely and simply to maintain the <span class="italic">status quo</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might say that it was not before time, and Mr Lisi’s excellent own-initiative report emphasises the various positive aspects of this plan, at the same time highlighting those points that seem to him to be inadequate, or those that seem to him to be the most important.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus he points out, rightly, that before any restrictive measures are adopted, more in-depth studies should be carried out, leading to a precise evaluation of the current situation in the Mediterranean fishing areas. That evaluation should tackle every aspect of fishing activity, including its biological, economic, social, technological, cultural and even anthropological aspects. Such an evaluation would also have to be on-going. Mr Lisi, also following the Commission’s plan, emphasises, again rightly, the fact that the Mediterranean ecosystem has a certain unity, which means that the issue has to be dealt with on a multilateral basis. There are currently six Member States bordering on the Mediterranean, if we take into account the accession of Malta and Cyprus, and that means that the Union will carry very considerable weight in any future negotiations. That can be demonstrated in the context of the Barcelona process. Permit me to remind you that it was in Barcelona that the first congress was held, in 1999, on maritime technological innovations and research.</p>
<p class="contents">The report emphasises the need for consultation with the people who are involved in fishing, who have organised themselves, and done a good job of it. They have modernised their fleet, and have adapted to change. All these efforts must be taken into account. They have often – almost always – done it with the aid of regional or autonomous authorities. That is the case in Catalonia and, I would say, in all the Catalan regions. It is important, therefore, that any regulatory action is taken in close consultation with the fishermen themselves, the institutions that they have formed, and the local, regional and autonomous authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
