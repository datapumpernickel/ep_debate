The Commission met here in Strasbourg this afternoon and took the following decisions, which I shall now relay to you. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it decided to give France a reasoned opinion with a deadline of five days in which to respond concerning the ban on British beef. The Commission took three further decisions on the application of Regulation No 4064/89 concerning merger control and on Regulation No 17/62 in application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, imposing fines ranging from EUR 100 000 to EUR 3 000 for each company that has supplied incorrect information in response to requests for information that have been made to them. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also adopted a communication which defines the objectives and the principles of the Community medium-term audiovisual policy and which establishes a strategy for the so-called “digital” age. The communication contains several principles that in the Commission’s opinion should be applied to the regulation of the audiovisual sector and to its support mechanisms. </p>
<p class="contents">Closely linked to this communication, the Commission approved another one, together with a proposal for a decision by the European Parliament and the Council and a proposal for a decision by the Council relating to a programme of support for the European audiovisual industry, which is the MEDIA PLUS 2001-2005 programme. The communication contains a renewed vision and principles for intervention relating to the MEDIA PLUS programme. The first proposal concerns the formalisation of a training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programme industry, the so-called “Media-Training” programme, which will be funded to the value of EUR 50 million for the period 2001 to 2005. The objective of the second proposal is to establish a programme of support for the development, distribution and promotion of unequivocally European audiovisual works. This is the MEDIA-PLUS programme – Development, Distribution and Promotion, which will be funded to the value of EUR 350 million for the period 2001 to 2005. </p>
<p class="contents">Following the Helsinki European Council meeting, on which a debate was held here this morning in plenary sitting, in the presence of the President of the Commission, the Commission approved a proposal for a decision by the Council which seeks the formal adoption of the guidelines on the Member States’ employment policies for 2000. In the framework of the internal reform of the Commission and following its statement of commitment to review the policy of outsourcing services, the Commission also approved a communication containing guidelines and the timetable for the implementation of this outsourcing policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Commission approved a proposal for a decision by the Council that aims to create a European Fund for Refugees. This is an instrument that aims to last for five years and which, thus, within a framework of multiannual programming, will enable us to give effective support to measures designed to improve conditions of reception, to promote integration and to make voluntary repatriation easier, as well as reintegration into refugees’ and displaced persons’ countries of origin. The fund will also contribute to the financing of emergency measures in the event of a massive influx of people who are in desperate need of international protection. A sum of EUR 36 million has been earmarked for the first year of this fund’s operation: EUR 26 million for the structural policy and EUR 10 million for emergency situations. </p>
<p class="contents">On this last point, I would like to add that the tradition of sums being earmarked for supporting refugees was started by the European Parliament in 1997 and annual decisions have been taken on it. Therefore, the time has come, following the Tampere European Council meeting to adopt a permanent legal base, which will give rise to a multiannual-type programme. The Tampere European Council asked the Commission to look into the creation of a financial fund aimed at resolving emergency situations. The Commission worked on the basis of the lessons it learned from its experience of Kosovo. This fund is therefore both a fund that has an emergency component but whose objective is, at the same time, to guarantee the financing of structural policy measures of support for the reception, integration and voluntary repatriation of refugees and asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, therefore, two interlocking budget lines, which nevertheless have different objectives. Firstly, the structural objective for the next five years is to allow the development by the Member States of policies for the reception and integration of refugees and asylum seekers, policies which must concentrate above all on priority actions of a very tangible nature. We see the Member States’ need to provide themselves with equipment and infrastructure for support for the reception, integration and voluntary repatriation of refugees and asylum seekers as a priority in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the Commission’s proposal is that the sum of EUR 26 million should be distributed amongst the Member States based on a criterion, on a distribution scale that, above all, takes into account the number of requests for asylum that each Member State has received in the last three years and the number of refugees that have been in each Member States over the last three years. The first component will make up two-thirds of the fund’s national financing component and the second component will make up one third. In terms of the management of this fund, the Commission proposes that it should, above all, be co-financed by Member States with the specific aim of committing each State to implementing concrete actions that will lead to improving the situation of asylum-seekers and refugees in the States of our Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is reserving the management of 10% of the funds for itself with the aim of supporting the development of innovative, transnational projects. In its proposal, the Commission adopts the system of the constant commitology of a consultative committee and aims, with this, to replace the system of the Technical Assistance Offices that was in force during the 1998-1999 period. I am Mr President, at the Chamber’s service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My question relates to the Media Plus Programme 2001-2006. The elections for the European Parliament had a turnout, unfortunately, of less than 50%. This programme should make provision for a focus on information and, more importantly, for a focus on training for journalists on the subject of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there is an increasingly urgent need to maintain good contacts with the public. We have seen from the example of the WTO that European broadcasters could have been represented much more intensively and that it is important for us to be up to date in media reporting if we want to play a leading role in the world. Which is why I am interested in knowing if it would be possible to invite journalists here from Europe and the rest of the world in order to explain our work to them and show them the advantages of European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the context of the Media Plus programme does not apply best to conducting information campaigns or communication aimed at our citizens. In reality, the central aim of these programmes is to support the training of professionals in the European audiovisual industry and to promote European artistic creation and research in the audiovisual sphere. They are, therefore, not information programmes in the strict sense of the word, but are rather programmes of support for creative initiatives by audiovisual professionals, which are markedly European in nature. </p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the percentage of audiovisual products originating in Europe and consumed in Europe is tiny, even if we take the value of the production of each of our national States together as well as those considered to be European productions because they involve the collaboration of more than one Member State. We hope that through this programme, there will be a significant increase in the worldwide quota of audiovisual products originating in Europe by means of a policy of supporting the creation, production and distribution of authentically European audiovisual products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same question comes up time and time again: to what extent is the budget of the European Union examined in order to ascertain which budget lines foster employment? Some expenditure certainly fosters employment by creating new jobs and new undertakings, some budget lines secure existing jobs and some budget lines destroy jobs.</p>

We consider that a major opportunity to discuss the concrete contribution of the Union to the creation of new jobs in Europe will be provided by the coming Lisbon Summit in March, which will be the time and the place to make an evaluation of the three processes I have just mentioned, Cologne, Luxembourg and Cardiff on one hand; and on the other to define the strategy, the synthesis of macro-economic policies, micro-economic entrepreneurial innovation and the challenge of the new information society.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Lisbon Summit I hope we will get a clearer idea as to how the Union budget can contribute to our common objective of creating new jobs in the continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not wish to encroach on members’ time, but you reported at the beginning that you are now instituting Treaty infringement proceedings against France. But the argument does not relate solely to France, it relates to Germany as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In the compromise forged between France and the Commission and Great Britain, it was agreed that the tests should also be used for diagnostic purposes and that English beef from this export programme should be labelled. These requirements were also imposed by Germany. My question is this: if you institute Treaty infringement proceedings without waiting for the results of the tests, when the tests have not even been carried out – we are still waiting for a proposal from Commissioner Byrne – and if the logistics for labelling have still not been set up, how then can you expect France and Germany to lift their import restrictions with this state of affairs?</p>
<p class="contents">Should the Commission not put the conditions in place and monitor them first, so that this can be done? Mr President, we await further explanation from the Commission on the matter tomorrow. Perhaps then we can go into it in greater depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by saying to Carlos Lage that what the Commission has approved today – the Media Plus programme – is entirely consistent with a strategy that has been developed by this Commission within the framework of the so-called I-Europe programme. And this will culminate – we hope – in the decisions of next March’s Extraordinary European Council meeting in Lisbon. </p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do is to prepare Europe, both in terms of infrastructure and of the content production industry, for the challenge of the information age which means of course that we are assuming that Europe has the ambition to participate in the new digital economy and in the new society of culture and information on a global scale. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the specific question that Mr Lage asked, we are not trying to establish a strategy based on the logic of protecting competition. It is a question of establishing a strategy with which, whilst accepting the rules of free competition, we can support European creation as well as distribution in order to be able to face this competition more successfully. Therefore, it is not a question of there being less competition, but of fairer competition which is given greater support by the European courts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He replied enthusiastically and even with a degree of passion which struck me as extraordinary.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain we are adopting a law on aliens which fully supports integration and the recognition of all rights. But we also need Europe to take a step forward with regard to education because a new wave of illiteracy is appearing, a new group of marginalised people, as a result of the fact that people are unable to understand the language of the country into which they are being integrated. These new illiterates cannot even understand safety instructions at work. They cannot understand road signs. This is a new type of illiteracy, a new kind of basic poverty which is currently becoming part of the social make-up of Europe. This problem is getting out of hand, perhaps through lack of information and research.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not be possible to carry out a systematic study of what the conditions and needs really are and where the essential points lie? Because without information it is not possible to draft a policy and without a knowledge of the true state of affairs it is not possible to create proper programmes. We need to lay firm foundations in this field, since nobody is taking responsibility for education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
