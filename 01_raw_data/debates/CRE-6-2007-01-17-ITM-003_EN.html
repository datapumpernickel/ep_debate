<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, whose very frequent participation in our debates is something we very much value, and, while he does attend as a matter of duty, I do hope he always enjoys the experience as well.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In your person, Madam Federal Chancellor, you symbolise the change that has occurred on our European continent. In 1979, when this Parliament was first directly elected by what were then the nine peoples of the European Community, Germany and our European continent were divided by minefields and barbed wire, and Berlin, the capital of your country, by a wall. You yourself were obliged to live in the unfree eastern part of your fatherland, which was eventually reunited on 3 October 1990. On 1 May 2004, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, together with Malta and Cyprus, joined us, to be followed at the beginning of this year by Bulgaria and Romania as members of the community of values – now comprising twenty-seven peoples – that makes up the European Union. You, Madam Federal Chancellor, are the first President of the European Council to come from that part of Europe that was formerly not free. Today, you represent the community of free peoples that is the European Union. Today, you will be addressing the democratically elected representatives of twenty-seven European peoples, amounting to nearly 500 million people. The European Parliament before which you will be standing is strong, self-assured and committed to European unity. That which, in 1979, appeared to be an unattainable mirage has now become reality, and that shows just how right it was and is that the policy of European integration should be founded on the values we share.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now invite you, Madam President of the European Council, to address the representatives of the citizens of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate again – not least on behalf of the Council, the President of your House and the Vice-Presidents, who were elected yesterday, and would like, at the beginning of the German Presidency, to offer you good, close, constructive and hard-working cooperation, as is only fitting when one is working together with what your President has just described as a self-assured parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spent all my life in Europe, but, in the European Union, I am still only a teenager, for I grew up in the former GDR, and it was only 17 years ago, following the reunification of Germany that resulted from the downfall of socialism, that I – like many millions of other people – became a citizen of the European Union. It follows, then, that, until I was 35, I knew the European Union only from the outside, and have known it from the inside only since 1990.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact of life that, almost always, everything looks different from the inside to what it does from the outside; that is the case with every house, and it is true also of Europe. Viewed from the outside, the European Union is an historic success story without parallel, one of the most impressive peaceful endeavours on this planet. European unification has been a stroke of great good fortune for the peoples of Europe, securing their freedom and making prosperity possible for them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Treaties of Rome will soon be 50 years old. We will be celebrating this anniversary on 24 and 25 March in Berlin, a city that is itself unequalled as a symbol of the reunification of Europe after the end of the Cold War. Let us be honest, though; 50 years is, in essence and in terms of history, no more than the blink of an eye. It has to be said, however, that, in this brief period of time, an unimaginable amount has been achieved in Europe. That, then, is Europe as seen from the outside.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet seen from the inside, too, the European Union makes a wonderful home, even more beautiful, I think – and that is my experience of the last seventeen years – than when seen from outside; it is a home that I wish never again to leave. There is no better place than our common European home for our life in Europe – of that I am convinced.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are extending it, enlarging it, in several places, restoring it; and sometimes I find myself thinking that, if we are so very occupied with extending and renewing the building, so that, today almost half a billion Europeans can call it home, then it would be easy for us, with all this building work going on, to miss what is so great, so unique, about it, to be sometimes scarcely able to grasp what it is that really makes this building what it is, what is at its heart.</p>
<p class="contents">That is how many people in Europe feel today; one feels it back home. They ask themselves: what is Europe meant to be? What do we need it for? What, at its very core, holds Europe together? In what does this European Union consist?</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who think there is little to be gained from trying to determine Europe’s nature; I have to say, speaking frankly, that I take a completely different view. I think back to Jacques Delors, who, famously, said: ‘We have to give Europe a soul’. To that, I would add, putting it in my own way, that we have to find Europe’s soul, for the fact is that we do not need to give Europe a soul, for it already has one.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this soul diversity? Scarcely anyone has expressed that more beautifully than the author Karel Čapek, a great European from Prague, and I quote: ‘He who made Europe made it small, even dividing it into tiny pieces, so that our hearts might rejoice, not in its size, but in its diversity’.</p>
<p class="contents">Diversity? It is true to say – there is no doubt about it – that it is from its diversity that Europe lives; the differences between our nations, between the regions of Europe, the various languages and ways of looking at the world are all things that we want to retain. We have neither the ability nor the desire to harmonise all the things that are capable of being harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, it is true: Europe lives from its diversity, but it is also true that diversity as such cannot be the universal European principle that helps us to understand what holds Europe together at its deepest level, in other words, what its soul is.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, by recognising the diversity of nations and people, we do achieve something else; it is this that brings us to what actually is the right question, the one we have to answer. That question is: what is it that makes Europe’s diversity possible?</p>
<p class="contents">I think the answer to this question is crystal clear; it is freedom that makes our diversity possible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is freedom on which our diversity depends, and by that I mean freedom in all its aspects: the freedom to express one’s opinions openly, even when they disturb others; the freedom to believe or not to believe; the freedom to engage in entrepreneurial activity; the freedom of the artist to shape his work according to his own conceptions. It is this freedom that Europe needs, in the same way that we need air in order to breathe. When it is restricted, we are stunted.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, for Europe, a matter of life and death always to be aware of the fact that freedom is not something that, once gained, can never be lost. Freedom must be won anew virtually every day.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Freedom is not without its obligations; it is inseparable from responsibility. If, then, we are to talk about freedom, we are actually talking about the freedom of others; it involves us saying, in Voltaire’s celebrated words, which I quote: ‘I may detest what you say, but I will give my life to defend your right to say it’. I see Voltaire as embodying the soul of Europe,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">He does so because that saying of his shows that what distinguishes Europe, that which constitutes its soul, is the way we handle our diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans have learned from our history how to make the most of diversity, and that characteristic that enables us to do that, that fits us for freedom in responsibility for others, is a valuable thing. That characteristic is tolerance. Europe’s soul is tolerance. Europe is the continent of tolerance. It has taken us centuries to learn that, and the process of learning tolerance has led us through suffering and calamity as we persecuted one another, attempted to exterminate one another, laid our homeland waste, and imperilled those things we hold sacred. The worst period of hatred, devastation and destruction lies less than a human lifetime in our past. What was done then was done in the name of my people.</p>
<p class="contents">This history, stretching over centuries, certainly does not entitle us Europeans to look down on the peoples in various regions of the earth today who are finding the practice of tolerance difficult. Those same centuries of history do, though, impose on us, in Europe, the obligation to promote tolerance the length and breadth of Europe and throughout the world, and to help everyone to put it into practice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Tolerance is indeed a demanding virtue; it demands our hearts and minds, it is something for which we have to make sacrifices, but not under any circumstances is it to be confused with indifference or the refusal to take sides, and, moreover, tolerance – of the sort we need in Europe – is about more than renouncing violence, it is about more than merely tolerating the other; on the contrary, it calls on us to want the other.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a quite simple way to reach the soul of Europe, to achieve tolerance; it necessarily involves us seeing things as other people see them. Just try it sometime; discovering the diversity of our continent – wherein our wealth resides – with the eyes of Europe’s many peoples is an exciting adventure, but we must not, in our fascination with it, forget that tolerance constantly faces new challenges. Let me make it clear, then, that Europe must never show even the slightest sympathy with intolerance,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">never even the slightest sympathy with the violence of extremists from left or right, or with violence in the name of a religion; if it fails to defend itself against intolerance, tolerance digs its own grave, or, as Thomas Mann put it, ‘Tolerance, when it extends to evil, becomes a crime’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is tolerance without yielding to intolerance that makes people human. In Lessing’s famous parable of the rings, Nathan the Wise tells the story of a dispute between three brothers as to who is the rightful inheritor of their father’s ring, and hence of religious truth, and the status as heir manifests itself only through good deeds, in which the brothers are to strive to outdo one another. Here, I think, we encounter anew the soul of Europe, in seeking the best in peaceful coexistence with, indeed, in peaceful commitment to, one another.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, as one who, as a Christian, explicitly affirms the Christian principles that underpin Europe, the finest thing in the play is the request that the Sultan makes of Nathan, when, despite all the boundaries of faith that divide them, he, as a Moslem, asks the Jew to ‘be my friend’.</p>
<p class="contents">That is indeed what we are seeking after and striving for; the co-existence of peoples one with another that was, and still is, the great goal of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was from that starting point that the first steps towards Europe were taken after 1945: neither the treaty on the Coal and Steel Community nor, indeed, the Treaties of Rome had much – if anything – to say about our culture, and it is mentioned only marginally in the Treaty of Maastricht. None of these treaties, though, would have been possible without a vision for a shared Europe, a vision, that is to say, of what Europe, at its very heart, is all about. They did, however, already touch on important questions concerning European coexistence and manage to answer some of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, on that basis for our present tasks that I can affirm my belief in a Europe in which all Member States – large and small, old and new – coexist as equals. It is only if we stick together that Europe will be a success. It is precisely because Europe is something we can achieve only together that our presidency is under the motto of ‘Europe – succeeding together’– and to that I would add that it is only if we stick together that Europe will be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in a Europe that concentrates on the things that are best managed at European level, but does so really effectively and with the necessary dedication. On the other hand, though, I believe in a Europe that quite deliberately leaves areas of policy where European regulation would tend to be a hindrance to the Member States, to their regions and to their local authorities to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe in a Europe that explicitly backs European solutions where it needs and wants to take joint action in order to be equal to such challenges of the twenty-first century as globalisation and the threats posed to peace and security by new dangers, terrorism being one of them</p>
<p class="contents">It is my conviction that it is only our understanding of tolerance that, ultimately, enables us to face all these challenges. The draft constitutional treaty is the first European treaty document to make explicit reference to tolerance as a characteristic of the Member States of the European Union, and as something with which we create the basis on which the Europe of the future can devise new and rational rules, by which I mean rules that will be commensurate with the new size of the European Union and with the challenges facing it and will have to make us capable of acting effectively. The fact is that we know that the rules as they stand at present neither enable the EU to be further enlarged, nor do they equip it to take the decisions that have to be taken. This is a state of affairs that we must put behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to do that, the EU’s powers and responsibilities, and those of the Member States, will have to be clearly described, Procedural rules will have to be defined with greater clarity than they have been before. To put it another way, the treaties that serve as our foundations must be adapted to changed conditions if the European Union is to survive in tomorrow’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with those facts in mind that I will, at the European Council’s behest, be consulting with all the Member States, the Commission and your House on how to find a way out of the crisis around the ratification of the constitutional treaty. The period of reflection is behind us; we now have to come up with new decisions by June. I am committed to making it possible for a timetable for the remainder of the constitution-making process to be adopted by the end of the German Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is in the interests of Europe, of its Member States and of its citizens, that this process be satisfactorily completed before the spring of 2009, when the next elections to the European Parliament will be held. Not accomplishing this would amount to an historic failure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us get stuck in to this task, and, in doing so, let us – as we have been before when taking historic decisions about Europe – bear in mind the way we handle our diversity, in other words, be guided by the spirit of tolerance, for the political, economic and social challenges that we face are indeed great, and they are very real.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there are two priority areas. For a start, the European Union is beset on every side by challenges to its foreign and security policies. In Kosovo, it will be monitoring the implementation of a solution to the problem of that region’s status. Stability in the Western Balkans is in the interests of all of us, and to that I would add that, this stability will be elusive if the states of the Western Balkans have no prospect of being Member States of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East, the European Union must work together with the United States of America, the UN and Russia in moving the peace process forward; this can be summed up as a task for what is known as the Middle East Quartet, but further progress, and the achievement of peace, stability and sustainable development in the Middle East, will be dependent on the European Union presenting a united front. The same can be said of the way we handle Iran and its nuclear programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In exactly the same way, Europe has an intrinsic interest in successful developments in Afghanistan. We know that only a combination of military and civilian endeavour will bring success; all the alternatives lead us into a dead end.</p>
<p class="contents">In its own neighbourhood, the European Union must show itself more willing to be politically creative than has hitherto been the case, for, while many countries desire accession, some of them will have to be disappointed. A neighbourhood policy is the rational and attractive alternative to that, and we will, under our presidency, be giving particular attention to developing a neighbourhood policy of this kind for Central Asia and the region around the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We also need to make every effort to make the Doha Round a success, for there is too much at stake, not only for us, but also for the developing countries. There is little time left in which to achieve a successful outcome, and we are determined to do everything possible to bring one about.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are not, however, standing still in this respect, for we want to hold a summit between the European Union and the USA at which to consider a deeper economic partnership across the Atlantic. The USA is the European Union’s most important trading partner. We are each others’ most important partners in investment. It is in the interest of our global competitiveness that we must bring down even more trade barriers in such areas as patent law, industrial standards or access to stock markets. I am firmly convinced that a single trans-Atlantic market is in Europe’s intrinsic best interests.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must not look only towards America; the partnership with Russia is also of strategic importance for Europe, and it is because it needs to be developed to its utmost extent that a new partnership and cooperation agreement must be negotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">In those negotiations, cooperation in energy matters will assume crucial importance. We will do everything in our power to get negotiations on that started before the end of the German Presidency. Let me make it perfectly clear that we need a stable relationship with Russia, for there can be no growth in trust without one. At the same time, of course, we cannot leave on one side such issues as the freedom of the media and of civil society or Russia’s conflicts with its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is our intention that the cornerstone of a global climate agreement from 2012 onwards be laid at the European Council in March and at the summit of the G8, over which Germany will also be presiding. If this is to happen, we know that Europe must blaze a trail, but we also know that we need to have the United States of America, among other countries, on-side, and so it is important that the USA be encouraged, where energy and climate policies are concerned, to work more closely with the European Union than it has done to date, for I am not exaggerating when I say that access to energy and the handling of climate change constitute the two great challenges that the human race will have to face in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We also want to redefine our relationships with Africa. Africa is changing. It is our neighbour. Investment in it – in both economic and political terms – is worthwhile and also a smart move, and so we will shortly be embarking on preparations for an EU/Africa summit, to be held under the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">My intention in taking your House on this brief global round-trip is to set out important challenges in the spheres of foreign and security policy, but, brief as this review has to be today, it will surely already be clear to you that it is only together that we can meet them. What we have to do we must do together; it is for precisely that reason, and in order that our words may be backed up by our deeds, that European foreign policy calls for a European foreign minister. That is another reason why we need the constitutional treaty.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Just as Europe must find new directions in its dealings with the outside world, it must do the same on the domestic front, for what our citizens expect of Europe, and of their governments, is that they will secure our standard of living, promote growth, create jobs and establish social security – in short, that they will maintain and develop our European model of the social state, and, moreover, enable it to withstand the pressures of globalisation. That, therefore, is the second priority of our work during our presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Strategy is founded upon the vision of a thriving and social Europe that also has a responsible approach to its environment. The economy is now growing, and this tendency is set to accentuate itself; that must not, of course be seen as an end in itself, and so when I hear the word ‘growth’ it is jobs that come to my mind. I am convinced that employment must be our first and principal concern, that that is what the social Europe is all about. We must also, of course, concern ourselves with the conditions under which jobs can be created; that is why energy will be a subject of pre-eminent importance at the March Council, at which we will be debating the Commission’s proposals and considering them from every angle.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that I regard as inseparable from the question of how we can create jobs and how we can be competitive and more efficient is the reduction of superfluous bureaucracy, which is another long-term task for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore be monitoring very closely the Commission's initiatives to this end, with which you will all be familiar under the heading of ‘better regulation’.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would also like to see, although I am aware that it will be difficult, is a debate on the related subject of what is termed the ‘discontinuity principle’ according to which legislative projects that have never actually become law are erased when new elections to the European Parliament fall due.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is what happens in most of the Member States, and it is a good democratic practice, so why is it not also done at the European level? If it were, then a new political start could be made when a new Commission was sworn in and the Members of the new Parliament took their seats. I am certain that this sort of democratic pause would make the elections to your House even more significant, and I ask you, honourable Members, to support the Council Presidency in this by submitting to it your own suggestions and ideas as to how this might work.</p>
<p class="contents">By no means will all of these tasks be accomplished in the space of six months. We have to – and we want to – overcome the limitations on breathing space occasioned by Council Presidencies lasting six months. It is because Europe needs continuity that the idea of a trio presidency is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that I will, at midday today here in Strasbourg, be inaugurating, together with my Portuguese and Slovene counterparts, the European Union’s first trio presidency. I might also mention that this idea for achieving more continuity in Europe is one of the innovations contained in the constitutional treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not fortuitous that, as I finish sharing my thoughts with you, we come back to the need for reform of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">What is not a matter of doubt is that a slow, bureaucracy-ridden and divided Europe will not be equal to any of the tasks I have mentioned, whether in foreign and security policy or in climate and energy policy, in relation to European research policy, in the cutting back of bureaucracy or in enlargement and neighbourhood policy. All these challenges demand united action on Europe’s part; they demand rules that make that sort of action possible; they call for additional effort, and for the willingness to accept change and renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I find it worth the effort to take a look at the conditions under which the regions of the world develop with the greatest success. In his researches into this, the American scientist Richard Florida has come up with three significant factors – technology, talents and tolerance. Only when all three of them occur together is sustainable growth in forward-moving sectors possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Technology, talents and tolerance – what good news for Europe, and what a good watchword for our actions! Technology, talents and tolerance – Europe lives from innovation. It is from scientific and technical progress, economic progress and social progress that Europe lives.</p>
<p class="contents">It also lives on curiosity. That is why Europeans invented something wonderful: universities. They are among the many European ideas that are nowadays taken for granted the whole world over, and curiosity cannot freely unfold without tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for that is that only those who do not think their own opinion is the last word or in every respect superior to someone else’s can have any sort of interest in finding out what others think, what they have experienced and what they have learned. It is only those, too, who concede that others can have smart ideas, can have a moral stance and act in a responsible manner who are ready to learn from them, and in doing so they can win, grow and develop themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Learning from one another leads to new insights. We might well, nowadays, call that innovation, but I mean that in a far wider sense than the merely technological. It has to do with cultural creativity, political concepts, and intellectual ideas. Without its outstanding capacity for innovation, Europe would not have become what it is today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would encourage us – no, I will go further and urge us – to remain curious in a spirit of tolerance, curious because we believe that, even in the twenty-first century, we are capable of shaping the world around us.</p>
<p class="contents">The German author Peter Prange, in his book, ‘Werte. Von Plato bis Pop’ [Values, from Plato to Pop)] wrote something very true, in the words, ‘Everything we Europeans have ever achieved, we owe to the contradictions within us, the eternal conflict inside ourselves, the constant jostling between opinions and conflicting opinions, ideas and opposing ideas, theses and antitheses.’</p>
<p class="contents">And why, I ask you, in the wake of countless wars and immeasurable suffering, is it that, out of all our inconsistencies in Europe, out of all our contradictions, something as magnificent as the European Union managed to emerge from the Treaties of Rome 50 years ago? What has enabled us to make the best of all this? You guessed it: It is that which, in my view, distinguishes Europe, the way we handle our diversity, which is tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should we not manage to do the same over the next 50 years?</p>

Both of you will be able to count on the Commission’s full support. Europe’s success depends on our sticking together.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents">2007 is a crucial year. The 50th anniversary of the Rome Treaties is certainly a time to celebrate past achievements, but also to build on those achievements to the benefit of a new generation of Europeans, a generation for whom Europe’s original rationale is in the past, but for whom Europe can and does offer so much for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a happy coincidence that this anniversary falls during the German Presidency. Many of our core policies – social and economic cohesion, the euro, the internal market, enlargement – owe much to Germany, and as Europeans, we should always have a word of gratitude for everything Germany has done for the great cause of European integration. As we have just heard from Chancellor Merkel, Germany’s commitment to Europe remains as powerful as ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency offers an opportunity to demonstrate why the European Union matters so much in the age of globalisation. I agree with the priorities presented just now by Chancellor Merkel. Indeed, I welcome the fact that those priorities are now the priorities of a trio of Presidencies – that gives increased consistency and coherence to the work of the European Council. Therefore, I will not go into detail, but will just concentrate on two immediate priorities, bearing in mind our work leading up to the March European Council: energy and climate change, and the declaration that we hope to adopt in March.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the March European Council. The Commission’s proposals from last week on energy and climate change form a central part of the Lisbon Agenda for growth and jobs. These are issues which touch the lives of every European, where Europe must continue to show leadership and where the European dimension is absolutely essential. We need that European dimension. You cannot tackle global warming, you cannot deliver sustainable, secure and competitive energy, without Europe. So what must be agreed at the European Council in March?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we in the Commission believe that we should agree on the strategic goal of an agreement by developed countries to cut their emissions by 30 % by 2020, which is essential to ensuring that global temperatures exceed pre-industrial levels by no more than 2°C. This will be our first objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must continue to lead, and to provide an incentive for others to follow. The leadership comes with the European Union commitment now to at least a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020; the incentive by making clear that we will go further if others join us. It is, after all, global warming, not just European warming. Others have to join our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, three pillars to deliver our objectives of sustainable, secure and competitive energy.</p>
<p class="contents">A single market in practice as well as on paper, to give real choice to European Union energy users and to trigger investment. This will require a clearer separation of energy production from energy distribution, and stronger independent regulatory control with a European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also makes proposals on improved interconnections, on transparency and on a new Customers’ Energy Charter. A 20 % target for energy efficiency by 2020, with detailed proposals for how to get there. A new drive for clean energy, through a binding commitment to triple renewable energy use by 2020. A 50 % annual increase in the energy research budget and commitments to advance clean hydrocarbon technology. There is a role for the European Institute of Technology in this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to hear Parliament’s voice on these issues in the run-up to the March European Council. The European Union could find no better way to launch its anniversary than by showing its ambitions for the future and to make it clear that today climate change is one of the most important challenges – if not the most important challenge – we face in this 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed the first part of the twin-track approach of policy delivery for Europe’s citizens alongside working towards a constitutional settlement, starting with the Berlin Declaration: a declaration on the future of Europe which the Commission proposed last May, and the European Council agreed in June.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Berlin Declaration is an opportunity for the Member States to commit themselves to the values and aims of the European Union. It must look forward and deliver a political statement about the Europe we want for the next 50 years and, as I proposed last May, it must fully involve Parliament and the Commission because, now, we are no longer only an economic community but also a political community, and only by involving the three main institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – can we do what our founding fathers did 50 years ago to show our political will for the next 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It provides an opportunity for the 12 Member States that joined in 2004 and 2007 to contribute, as full members, to the vision of our common future. This time they will not only sign up to what has been agreed but will also have a say on the Europe we all want to build. It is appropriate that this Declaration – a declaration for the future of Europe – will be signed in Berlin, the symbol of a reunited Europe, a Europe reunited in the values of freedom, peace and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the Declaration say? I think today’s leaders should stand on the shoulders of the founding fathers and look ahead to the next 50 years – to the challenges which could not be imagined in 1957 but which Europe must face in 2007. Put simply, they must equip Europeans for globalisation, in a Europe of open economies, open societies, in a Europe which must engage with citizens, not ignore them. A Europe built on citizens’ consent has solid foundations. A Europe which does not work for that consent is built on sand.</p>
<p class="contents">I have five practical proposals for this Declaration. First, solidarity: an enlarged and open Europe requires greater cohesion – social cohesion as well as economic.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, sustainability: the fight against climate change, through energy and other policies, should be a defining mission for Europe’s future. This was not perceived as a priority in 1957. This must be a priority in the Declaration and in the constitutional settlement in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Third, accountability, transparency and access to information should become not only rights for European citizens but also obligations for Europe’s institutions. At the beginning of the European Community, that could be done diplomatically, but today diplomacy is not enough: we need real democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, security: Europe must guarantee the security of its citizens whilst preserving fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, the external dimension: promoting Europe’s values in the world, as well as its interests. Sustainability, accountability, solidarity and security cannot – indeed, must not – stop at Europe’s borders. I believe the European citizens want us to have a more coherent approach on the global scene. This is also one of the reasons why we need a constitutional settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">These are five specific suggestions for the Berlin Declaration, a declaration which should create the momentum to settle the constitutional question. Chancellor Merkel has set out the Presidency’s ambitions. We need, by the end of the Presidency, a common roadmap towards an institutional settlement, before the next European elections in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">However, not only do we need a roadmap; we also need a settlement to clear the clouds of doubt which hang over parts of Europe, to show vitality and confidence to our partners, and to make the European Union more transparent, more effective, more democratic and more coherent in the world. As I have said before, Nice is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our task today is to show leadership, translating the principles and values that were at the core of the foundation of our Community for the global challenges of the 21st century. Europe was never more needed than today. We need it not only for ourselves but also for this unpredictable, unstable world. We cannot build tomorrow’s Europe with yesterday’s tools. We have a great opportunity to start changing that in the next six months. Let us go to work.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joseph Daul, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr Poettering, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Merkel, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, I should like to express my emotion on the occasion of the first major debate under the presidency of Mr Poettering, Mrs Merkel and our Commission President. These three figures are members of our political family, but if I express a favourable opinion on the proposals made by the German Presidency, it is not only because of that. It is also because of the path taken by Mrs Merkel herself, because of her political choice, the choice of Europe, as you explained so well this morning, Mrs Merkel.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the role of an elected representative? To anticipate, to make decisions, to take responsibility for those decisions before his or her public. As a European, I can only welcome the Presidency’s proposals not only on such crucial issues as energy, climate change, environmental protection, security and justice, immigration policy, the coordination of economic policies, development policy and international trade, but also on relations with the United States and Russia. On these issues, the German Presidency is developing a resolutely European, and even pro-European, approach.</p>
<p class="contents">On the institutional issue, you stated, Mrs Merkel, that you would not adopt a minimalist approach but that you would try to strike a balance between the position of the 18 countries that ratified the Constitutional Treaty, that of France and the Netherlands, which rejected it, and that of the countries that have not yet adopted an official position: it will be difficult to do so, I grant you that.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that it will be very difficult, even illusory. However, there is a long list of political ambitions that seemed unachievable but that nonetheless became a reality because courage prevailed over demagogy. Let us think about peace in Europe, about the return of prosperity and growth up to the creation of the euro, about the end of Communism after the fall of the Berlin wall and about the reunification of the European continent: the only battles lost are those that are not fought.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Presidency, Mrs Merkel, has decided to take up the institutional challenge. You are right to do so, and our political family will help you to do so. Why are you right? Because, in the same way that we welcome the recent enlargements of the Union, we must point out that the challenges facing us require Europe to provide itself with an effective decision-making system as quickly as possible. The European Convention was created in 2002 and drew up a draft Constitutional Treaty precisely in order to put right the inadequacies of the Treaty of Nice. How is it that what was considered urgent five years ago in a Europe of 15 is considered less so today in a Europe of 27? You will have the full support of the political family of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has played a leading role on this issue in terms of seeking a new approach enabling Europe to provide itself with the tools it needs to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying, the German Presidency has chosen Europe, a Europe that suffers from a public image that is not, let us say, always positive, a Europe that, paradoxically, is also perceived by a large majority of citizens as the level best suited to respond to a number of everyday problems.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean, of course, that everything can and must be dealt with at European level. As far as our political family is concerned, the principle of subsidiarity constitutes a major principle of governance. Following the events of early 2006, and then those of the last few days regarding the Union’s and its neighbours’ energy supply, Europe must speak not only with one voice but also with a firm voice in order to protect its strategic interests. I would like to reaffirm my group’s support for the German Presidency’s and the Commission’s position regarding Russia. The Presidency has also announced that one of its main priorities will be to strengthen transatlantic relations. I welcome that move.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation founded on dialogue and on balanced relations with the United States is a key factor of stability, as you said. The prospect of a transatlantic market can only stimulate our economies, boost growth and create jobs. We must therefore work towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">On 25 March, the people of Europe will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. This is a very important event, which will be marked by the staging of a European summit and by the adoption of the Berlin Declaration. Let us remind everyone of the common values that unite us, but let us also highlight the future priorities of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The world has changed over the last 50 years. The reasons for us to unite and to close ranks have certainly changed somewhat, but they are at least as relevant now as they were in the past. The role not only of political decision-makers but also of economic players and the media is to be strong and convincing in sending out a positive, clear and perceptive message – a message of responsibility, quite simply.</p>
<p class="contents">The new reality is that major challenges can now only be addressed within the framework of large regions. Europe is one of those regions, perhaps one of the most powerful, the most prosperous and the most stable, one of the most democratic too, and therefore one of the most attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, Madam President, that, with your determination and with that of your entire government, the next six months will be put to good use. We offer you our full political support so that, for all the complexity of the task, we might see progress made in June and assess the work left to do. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> I wish you much happiness and success, my dear President-in-Office.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office’s speech was an encouraging one, and I am grateful to her for everything in it that had that effect, for it is the spirit of that speech that Europe needs, and it is that that will enable us, under the German Presidency of the Council, to make headway. With that end in mind, you will find the Socialist Group in this House right alongside you.</p>
<p class="contents">Please permit me, though, Madam Federal Chancellor, to make a number of comments on what you had to say about the social Europe – which was not, in fact, very much at all. You have the right idea about freedom, and we agree with you on that score. Yes, indeed, freedom of opinion, the freedom of religion on our continent, to which we are committed, entrepreneurial freedom, artistic freedom – all these things are right and fundamental to the realisation of what we call the European model, but these freedoms cannot be made real without freedom from fear and freedom from social threats.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is in social security that freedom is made real. What people on this continent expect of this Union, Madam President-in-Office, is that it should be social. If the Europe we are building does not give people the feeling that it is offering them social security, that Europe will have no foundation and will not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked what it is that enables us to hold this Europe together, and that something is, indeed, technology, tolerance and the fostering of talents, but the model of success that we have derived from the second half of the twentieth century is about combining economic progress with social security. If we do not continue to do that, I can tell you, Madam Chancellor, that we in Europe are going to be in big trouble, and that is why I would ask you to add to your concept of freedom – which I unreservedly endorse – the idea that freedom is about social security too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason, Madam Chancellor, that I urge you to do something, something very important, and it is this. You spoke about the Constitution. This Constitution incorporates the European Union’s horizontal social commitment; the only thing is that it has not yet entered into force, but we can make this social commitment even before it does so. I call on you to join with the Commission in putting forward the machinery that will make it possible for the social impact of the EU’s legislation to be assessed. Everything we do happens in a single economic area, but also within the territory of twenty-seven sovereign states with their own specific national social security systems. Let us then gauge beforehand what effects the laws we make will have on the social mechanisms in the Member States. If we do that in advance, we will not have to do what we did with the Bolkestein directive, with us in Parliament making up afterwards for what the Commission lost.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, eighteen Member States have said ‘yes’ to this Constitution. It has been rejected in two referendums, but endorsed in two others. It is together that Europe succeeds, and it is always one thing that makes shared success possible, namely the ability to compromise, the capacity for solidarity. What you have said about the constitution shows us the right way. Given that this Constitution enjoys majority support in Europe, let us start with what is at its heart and ask those who are sceptical about it to come up with their own suggestions as to how we, in a spirit of solidarity, might arrive at a satisfactory compromise, and then you will be on track.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with secure energy supplies, Europe needs fair partnership, especially with those states on whose cooperation we rely. You said what had to be said about the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, but what we also need is to realise that climate change is not going to be beaten unless we abandon the economics of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to use less energy and to use it more efficiently, and that, let me add, means that we also need technology – you got that right – and the faithful observance of contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">You are at the head of a government that has abandoned nuclear power. It is a good thing that you have done that, and you have a chance to win others in Europe over to your government’s line, which would be even better.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause and laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If, however, you want to use the Council Presidency to gain an advantage on the domestic political front and to go back to nuclear power – which is what you wanted to do as leader of the CDU – then I have to tell you that what coalition agreements have in common with contracts for the supply of gas is that those who do not keep to them lose credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">You also said what needed to be said about Africa and international policy. I am grateful to you for the Council Presidency’s commitment to peacemaking in the Middle East and around the world, and, above all to fair sharing as a means of securing peace. Your making reference to Africa is something that we wholeheartedly endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">You invoked the spirit of this Europe of ours. Sixteen years ago today, on 17 January 1991, Helmut Kohl was elected the first Federal Chancellor of a reunited Germany, and you were a member of his government. Opinions differ on Helmut Kohl and there is much that can be seen differently from the way he – and you as a member of his government – saw it, but there is no disputing the fact that Helmut Kohl’s achievement was an historic one, in that he took Germany – reunited, free of every nationalistic attitude and of the desire to become a major power – and made it part of the European project. By so doing, he created confidence in the continent that had been reborn after the fall of the Wall, confidence in our country, a confidence that grew and spread throughout Europe. It is that spirit of confidence that indwells the Treaties of Maastricht and of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the Europe of Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand, the Europe of Felipe González and Jacques Delors, the Europe of Jacques Santer, too; the Europe of many great men and women. I might add that it was also the Europe of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who gave their assent to these Treaties. This was the Europe that had the will to achieve the re-ordering of our continent to the end that hatred and intolerance might be done away with, that division might be replaced by the common good.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing I would like to add, and it is that this was not easily arrived at; it had to be achieved and fought for; people had to commit themselves to it, and that is what these men and women did, and they did so for one simple reason, namely that they had learned from shared experience that the opposite of tolerance and the desire for peace is hatred and warfare, and if you do not want Europe to go back to that, you have to dedicate yourself to what you, Madam President-in-Office, called the soul of Europe, and for that soul you must fight. We are all alongside you and ready to do so!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graham Watson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span>President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats wish you every success for the German Presidency of the European Union. You have presented to us a bold programme entitled ‘Europe Succeeding Together’, firmly in the cooperative tradition of our most powerful Member State. Liberals and Democrats welcome the commitment in the opening paragraph, where you say that European integration is the foundation of our common future and that its dynamic development must continue. I commend to you, Chancellor, the words of the poet Goethe when he wrote: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> ‘<span class="italic">Bleibe nicht am Boden haften, frisch gewagt und frisch hinaus</span>’ – bidding us not be rooted to the spot but venture out and risk new things. </p>
<p class="contents">Progress will be built on the pillars of a strong economy. I am disappointed that the word ‘social’ appears in this programme almost twice as many times as the word ‘competitive’. The word ‘liberal’ appears only once. I fear this document owes more to the SPD side of your coalition than to others. However, even the SPD in Germany is lagging behind the new socialist consensus at their conference in Oporto. It is no good trying to protect energy giants like RWE or EDF in the hope that they can stand up against GazProm. We need free markets and energy security and there is no contradiction between the two.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We welcome your plans for technology and talent, but you will not do it if you cut the budgets that the European Union has for research, innovation and education.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We will work closely with you on justice and home affairs. You talk of intensive police and judicial cooperation between Member States, but we are deeply concerned and we will work to change your plans, which focus too much on the repressive aspects of policy and not enough on freedom. You said fine words in your speech about tolerance. However, data collection is mentioned in your document, but there is nothing about data protection: there is not a single mention of it in the section on civil rights.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In your document we find border guards, but on development aid policy to relieve the misery that pushes people towards our shores, there are just a few platitudes on the final page. We may be in danger of creating in Europe what Dieter Lattmann once described in your own country as <span class="italic">eine lieblose Republik</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may cite one sentence from your document, it is this: ‘if a common European area of justice cannot be achieved in the field of civil and criminal law, the European single market will remain incomplete’. I welcome the fact that you see justice and home affairs as part of the European single market, but then why do you stubbornly resist demands from citizens to make policy in the same way as you make policy for the single market: qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You speak of the role of national parliaments, but there is nothing about the role of the European Parliament. You seek to adopt the Prüm Treaty on data-sharing outside Community competence. It is no surprise that a former president of your country, Roman Herzog, said that Germany is no longer a parliamentary democracy because so many of its laws come from Brussels. But we need at least to make Europe a proper parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In common foreign and security policy too – another area that should come under the first pillar – the EU is incapable. We watch the disintegration of Iraq: last year alone there were 34 000 civilian deaths; people saying that today is better than tomorrow. That is the most urgent geopolitical issue of our time. As you say in your programme, we need a more effective and a more coherent foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome what you say about the environment. The Green Party in your country may have biodegraded, but it clearly had some impact. We support, in particular, your plans for environmental technology and the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities. We hope you will work towards a European Union budget in 2008 that gives us the means to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor, on the Constitution I wish you success. Many in my group are not optimistic that the conditions exist in London, Paris or Warsaw for a move forward. Please work on bringing the EU closer to its citizens, on better regulation and on greater transparency. Build the basis of support for the Constitution, but remember what Theodor Fontane said: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> ‘Good digestion is better than a million, but a thick skin is better than good digestion.’ </p>
<p class="contents">I wish you every success in your Presidency. We will judge you on your achievements at the end of your term.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cristiana Muscardini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the UEN Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is now my fourth parliamentary term in this House, and it was a pleasure for me to listen to your speech and to your hopes for the future, Chancellor, but we also need something more definite.</p>
<p class="contents">You quite rightly referred to the responsibilities of freedom: we must not abuse our own freedom to the detriment of others. We believe that, but we would also recall something else that Voltaire said: ‘If you wish to converse with me, define your terms.’ Today the terms are perhaps the need for clearer internal and external rules that we can all share, the need to have not only a charter of rights in Europe but also a charter of duties: the citizens’ duties towards the institutions, but most of all the institutions’ duties towards the citizens. It is essential to have tolerance and goodwill towards others, and to see everything through other people’s eyes. Hence we need greater generosity both within the EU and outside it.</p>
<p class="contents">You are both the first woman Chancellor and the first President-in-Office of the Council to have been born and brought up beyond the Iron Curtain. To me, that is a good omen and a sign that our Europe is growing both morally and politically.</p>
<p class="contents">This Presidency’s term is starting with two significant events: the entry of Bulgaria and Romania, consequently requiring a greater spirit of cooperation; and the election of Mr Poettering, who has received both many plaudits and also many calls to do all he can to carry through the major institutional reforms that are essential for us to function effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is represented by three institutions, but its full political role, if I may say so, lies both with the Council and with Parliament, which must not be sidelined in the dialogue on reform that has to be restarted at once. The new treaty needs to be made more intelligible and suited to our needs, respecting our peoples’ roots and showing that it can cope with the breakneck changes occurring in our society and in other peoples’. We must now reopen the debate in Parliament, and not just go along with the intergovernmental method.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the Presidency's alarm at the energy problem, which must be solved within a European framework and not, of course, through bilateral agreements between Russia and individual Member States. We must also throw out the idea of eastern, southern, northern or western Europe. The standard of living of each and every one of our citizens is an issue for the whole Union. Energy guarantees our development, economic stability and daily life; energy and development go hand in hand with environmental issues and respect for factors that will lead to disaster if abused.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot make do with a lack of information about what is happening in Africa in terms of economic development, living standards, human rights or security policy, if we want to eradicate terrorism. The EU must not be seen to be in disarray and unwilling to take a firm stand on the death sentences handed down on European citizens in Libya or the ongoing kidnappings of technicians in Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in Somalia shows how little information the European Union has about the situation on the ground there and how little Europe knows about international jihad movements. The Union has a duty to support legitimate governments, help people achieve a better standard of living, and defeat terrorism wherever it may be.</p>
<p class="contents">Both personally and on behalf of our group, I call for a commitment by the German Presidency to combat the spread of paedophilia and the use of information networks and the media to snatch away children’s dignity, lives and hopes. We have a duty to protect the weak, including abused and exploited children, whose physical and mental wellbeing must be safeguarded. We must also enable our society to develop in peace. We therefore call for a new path that will lead Europe towards having shared rules governing technology and communications, in order to safeguard our citizens and our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Merkel, in our opinion it is important to have you here with us often, so that our separate responsibilities may together give rise to a Europe with improved living standards, greater certainty in international relations and more development for the less-fortunate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what we have in common, and no further word needs to be written on the subject, but we do also have a certain impatience, and that baffles me. What then? We love Europe, and we want to shape it. On the subject of tolerance, you should have quoted not only Voltaire, but also been magnanimous enough to quote Rosa Luxemburg, who said the same thing and is also part of our shared European history. That is the way of life; I love Voltaire, and I love Rosa Luxemburg, and in an age of women we are also allowed to quote women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because Mr Daul mentioned the subject that I should also like to add that it is diversity, too, that leads me to dream of diversity during a Presidency, and so I close my eyes and imagine Mr Daul having to deliver a speech in 2008, when a woman, as President of France, will stand before this House and restore this diversity. It will be wonderful, and I am dreaming of how you and Segolène Royal will go about it, hand in hand and cheek by cheek, in Berlin or in Paris. In Europe, a new era has begun, with diversity and more women – wonderful, tremendous!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That was my thought for Sunday. That is political stuff rather than a comedy performance. Just as you, in Germany, made the right choice in Mrs Merkel, it is a purely political statement when I say that those in France who are backing Segolène Royal are right. This is not an act, but deep and serious politics.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the points that you made. Yes, the constitutional process needs to be driven forward – a wonderful idea, but how to do it? Earlier on, our good friend Mr Barroso said that Nice is not enough. It is not just that Nice is not enough; we do not want an intergovernmental conference of the kind that made Nice such a dreadful result. If you think, then, that the constitutional process can again be restarted in the darkened rooms of an intergovernmental conference, then the people of Europe will turn their backs.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is public debate, a Convention, with votes. The Sherpa policy, the period of reflection, is over. I can tell you everything that the governments think; when it comes to the constitutional process, the last word was said long ago. How are we to compel all the governments? How are we to compel the diplomats to arrive at their compromises in public rather than in a darkened room? That, at the end of the German Presidency, will be your challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Who says, too, that it was the Convention that created these problems for us? It was the Convention that adopted the first and second parts, then along came the governments and – in Thessaloniki – obliged us to accept the third – and then the Convention had to spend two or three weeks sorting things out. It is the inter-governmental votes that are always the problem in the Constitution, and that is why we do not want them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You talked about the challenges Europe faces in the Middle East. Right, but how do we deal with them? I will give you a tip: here in this House …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption by Mr Ferber)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You have enough problems with your CSU, so just shut up! I have a tip for you, too: Mrs Pauli is right.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Another woman: women are wrecking everything these days.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted, however, to talk about the Middle East: here in this House, we adopted a resolution to the effect that we needed a major regional conference. That sort of thing takes preparation, of course. That is why – since the European Union started out with coal and steel – it might perhaps have been a good idea for Europe to set in motion a big regional conference on water, for it is water that all these states have in common, that Israel has in common with Palestine and Syria with Israel. If we were to manage, by way of a specific project, to get these countries to trust one another, I do think that would be the first step towards longer-term understanding in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">You said we should join with America in taking action; by all means, but let us not be tied down in the way they are in America, with innovations constrained by undemocratic patent laws. That sort of thing destroys diversity, so not everything needs to be learned from America.</p>
<p class="contents">You then had something to say about the climate problem, but let us not be dependent on California where climate is concerned. Forget Bush! Let us go to California and see what progress can be made on the climate front.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause and interruptions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Martin, there are some conservatives who do something intelligent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruptions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I was talking about climate, not about the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you want to foster talent. In that case, you also need to consider the way in which German schools, and others, do that. The German school system does not foster talent; it destroys it. That is what we have learned from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Madam Federal Chancellor, we are of one mind …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Disturbance)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Darling, shut up!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Disturbance)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are of one mind where Europe is concerned, but there will inevitably be argument about how we achieve what we want.</p>

<p class="contents">Of the heavy responsibilities incumbent on your Presidency, certain issues will unfortunately be more mundane, not least that of the launch of the process that is due to lead to the adoption, in two years’ time, of a new European treaty. It is on this one point that I should like to make some brief comments. My colleague, Mrs Zimmer, will expand on my speech in a few moments’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">My first remark concerns the joint declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which, in this context, will constitute an important message to our fellow citizens. Allow me to make a suggestion: beware of too much backslapping, of overly polished assessments, of commitments that are abstract and wordy on the major principles but evasive on the issues that cause anger! That kind of approach will in no way lessen the crisis of confidence that we are experiencing, but will be liable, instead, to increase the scepticism that is growing a little bit everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">My second warning concerns the initiative – which is certainly not incumbent upon you personally – to gather together at the end of January representatives solely from the countries that ratified the draft Constitutional Treaty. I regard this manner of pointing the finger at the so-called bad pupils of the European class as unfortunate and counterproductive. What we need to do, instead, is to hold an open, frank and respectful dialogue with all of the nations of the Union, and not avoid contradictions, because, if we do avoid them, we will just be keeping ourselves happy and we will not make any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe – and this is the final point that I wish to highlight – that the unrest being caused by the Union’s current approach is not just French and Dutch. It is European. And, as Mr Schulz said, it is primarily social in origin. This is where we need to change the substance. In the German Presidency’s programme, you propose what Mr Schulz has just requested of you, which is that – and I quote – in future, European projects should be examined in the light of their social repercussions, too. Marvellous! Let us start straightaway, then! Let us start with the third rail package on the liberalisation of rail, for example, or by extending this approach to directives that already exist, such as the Services Directive or the Working Time Directive, or to forthcoming decisions such as the one on the modernisation of labour law.</p>
<p class="contents">As your fellow countrymen, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, used to say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The proof of social Europe is in its being used in practice. Thus, to quote your Presidency's logo, together, we will make Europe succeed.</p>

<p class="contents">They then attribute this weariness with Europe to the fact that the constitution is not yet in place, and blame its absence for the fact that the Council still conducts its business behind closed doors, believing that the way to remedy democratic deficits is to hand over even more powers to the Commission. What a perverse way of looking at things!</p>
<p class="contents">Things really are getting comical when the proposal is made for a Europe-wide referendum on the constitution with the suggestion being made at the same time that those states that do not accept it might want to consider whether they want to stay in the EU at all. We do not though, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, need a constitutional monster with centralising tendencies; on the contrary, we must, at last, allow our citizens to play their part in taking important decisions and resolve, as is long overdue, such problems as globalisation, migration and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">You would be better advised to concentrate on delivering on one of your core election promises by preventing Turkey from joining the EU, for that is something you owe not only to your German compatriots, but also to Europeans as a whole, and to spend Germany’s time in the presidency in seeking to resolve, once and for all, the problem of mass illegal immigration in the south of the EU; you would thereby be doing a far better service to the European identity of national and cultural diversity, which you so rightly praise, than you would be reanimating a long-dead constitutional treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With that end in mind, you have, at any rate, our unconditional support.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that you will succeed in reinvigorating the spirit of trust to which Mr Schulz referred earlier, although he did, to my surprise, omit someone from his list, namely the former Federal Chancellor Mr Schröder, by whose foreign policy this spirit of trust in Europe was in fact destroyed. We are right behind you!</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask that there should be no debates in this House on domestic policies such as nuclear energy or schools – such things are irrelevant. Instead, we want to support the German Presidency in its priorities of moving the constitutional treaty forward and revising the way Europe makes its laws. I also welcome the proposal for discontinuity; it is right that the European Parliament – and the Commission too – should have a greater part to play, but it was, in the past, often because of the Council that proposals for legislation took as long as ten years before appearing again above the surface.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad, Madam Federal Chancellor, that you have set yourself the particular goal of prioritising Europe’s external policy problems and the problems of energy policy during your presidency of the Council. I am sure that you will succeed in this, and we, in any case, are behind you.</p>
<p class="contents">It may, of course, be the case that, as Mr Schulz says, Europe is a model of peace, of prosperity, of how to run an economy. If it is to be developed as a social model, then we will have to give some thought to where the European Union’s powers lie. It is the Member States who should discharge their responsibilities where matters are within their remit, no more and no less.</p>

The only value we find missing is that of solidarity. You affirmed your belief in a social Europe, but you would get even more support from our side if you were to include solidarity in the list of values that is very important to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking here of the unemployed and of the vulnerable members of society, to whom you too made reference. Poverty is on the increase in certain European countries, and that is a scandal, something that we must deal with together. I would recommend the open expression of this sort of solidarity – as well as of solidarity between the individual Member States – as an addition to your programme. One thinks, here, of energy policy; we will not achieve a common energy policy without solidarity between the individual countries on that front.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards foreign policy, it is to be regretted that the American President did not take Chancellor Schröder’s advice, and ended up in the mess in which we now all find ourselves. I do not want to use that to score anti-American points right now, but Richard Haas, an American moderate, recently had some things to say on the subject, and I shall now quote him word for word: </p>
<p class="contents">‘The American era in the Middle East is over. More than anything else, it was the Iraq war [...] that brought it to an end.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> This is where Europe must help, this is where it can jump into the breach. There is much for the German Presidency of the Council to do when it comes to seeing how we can help the people of this crisis-torn region, particularly the socially vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Germans have taken some good initiatives with regard to Syria; France has taken a good one with regard to Iran, too, but I urge you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that we get a common foreign policy founded on solidarity, for it is only then – when we give pride of place to solidarity – that we will be able to help people in the Middle East, not to mention the people of our own continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not doubt that what you had to say about the values that bind us together – tolerance and freedom among them – mark an important step towards finding the soul of which you spoke.</p>
<p class="contents">You will of course be aware of what is expected of the German Presidency, and, in particular, of you as President-in-Office, for courage and the strength for leadership are completely absent from this EU of ours, and the expectation of you, Mrs Merkel, is no more and no less than that you will demonstrate that courage and that strength that fits you for leadership, so get down to brass tacks! That is what everyone in this House expects of you.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that you have declared yourself willing to work very hard and constructively with us. You can rely on us. I would like to see the presidency of what is both your country and mine become a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad of your forthright statement about the timetable for the constitutional treaty, and think you are right to say that it needs to be ratified by the spring of 2009. You want to get the other Heads of Government committed to this, but, of course, saying this naturally involves saying something else too, namely which constitutional treaty we are actually talking about here. The present one is a busted flush, having been rejected, and so I would like to ask you to say, in quite definite terms, what you think about this. Do you want a shorter version of the kind already proposed, or are you holding fast to the present constitutional treaty? How is it meant to be ratified? Is every country to adopt its own procedure and do it at its own speed? Are there to be national referendums, or is that something you want to steer clear of?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Merkel, you have said on repeated occasions that you want to put the citizen centre stage in European policy, and that is precisely what is needed. That is the response we need to increasing euro-scepticism or rejection of the EU – a citizens’ Europe, rather than a Europe of secret diplomacy. The constitutional treaty is more than just a document laying down processes and voting procedures; it can be the foundation of the shared values that bind us and which are summarised in it. It is for that reason that Europe’s citizens should be given the chance to themselves say what they think about it. What, Mrs Merkel, do you think of the idea of a Europe-wide referendum held on the same day throughout Europe? That would be an historic event. The people could say what they think.</p>
<p class="contents">What I need to say before I wind up is that more than a million people would like us to conduct this sort of debate in Brussels. That, too, would make me happy. It is up to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I approve of the way in which you follow Marxist dialectics in referring to great Europeans from Plato to Rosa Luxemburg by way of Voltaire, and it is a good thing that you did, but – and this is where I have to contradict you – we, in Europe and the EU, are still a very long way away from putting civil liberties and human rights into practice. People without personal documentation cannot enjoy them, nor do the numerous refugees who turn up on a daily basis at the EU’s external borders. We have not forgotten the images from Ceuta, Melilla, and Lampedusa.</p>
<p class="contents">You are also right, Madam Federal Chancellor, to say that freedom must be won anew time and time again, but it is also true that freedom can exist only where there is social equality. As I see it, the implementation of individual freedoms and human rights in society faces an obstacle in the shape of the millions of people who are marginalised every day, without work, unable to live on their incomes, not to mention the deepening social divisions caused among other things and in particular by the enforcement of the Lisbon agenda. The same goes for access to culture and education for everyone living in the EU, including, and particularly, in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that you did not cite one single concrete initiative that would reposition the EU as a social Union, that aims to bring in binding minimum social and environmental standards and minimum incomes in the EU, and that would also make a consistent policy of combating poverty and social exclusion the number one priority for the German Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I have something else to say about the European Constitution. On top of all the critical comments that have already been made about it, we also expect attention to be given, in any debate on the Constitution, to the need for minorities, too, to be able to live with a constitution in the future and not to feel permanently obliged to say ‘no’ to it. Any constitution must be forward-looking and must also be compatible with changing political majorities. That is not possible if it is to be characterised by undiluted free-market economic thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You also want to ensure that, in future, 84% of German laws will no longer be enacted in Brussels, a state of affairs deplored by the former President of Germany, Roman Herzog, a few days ago. The process is now under way of negotiating in smoke-filled rooms and going through the rejected Constitution in order to see which of its clauses can be sneaked through without having to have referendums. If this exercise is continued with, the result will be a serious crisis of confidence between citizens and their elected representatives. It makes much more sense to map out the future in conjunction with our citizens, rather than in opposition to them. Why not say right now that the text on which you agree will be put to referendums in all the countries in which that is constitutionally possible, and preferably on the same day. In that way, we should know people’s position on the matter, and the final clauses might quickly be negotiated and put in place. We should also have ground rules that people actively support, instead of having a situation in which people react with further disgust to all elected representatives. </p>

There are, of course, technical matters, and it would be good, for example, to guarantee our farmers’ future after 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Our destiny lies elsewhere, however. If the aim is to find the soul of Europe, Mrs Merkel, there are only two paths to take. The first is that of Orpheus, who went to the underworld for trying to find Eurydice – the European Constitution – whom he lost because he looked back. Mrs Merkel, look forwards! Do not go back, even to constitutional treaties. Instead, make a strategic offer to France that goes beyond the 1963 Elysée Treaty. For instance, faced with the challenges of which you speak, be Churchill rather than Bismarck; propose sharing a symbol – Franco-German co-nationality, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since you are searching for the soul of Europe, the second path is that of the world that Europe, from Vasco de Gama, Mr Barroso, to Goethe, has enlightened. The real challenge of the 21st century is to build the world starting with the shared dimensions of planetary co-ownership, that is to say, the collective management of food – eating – of water – drinking – of medicines – caring for oneself – and of education – acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p class="contents">Despite that success, however, Europe is in crisis and too many of our fellow citizens have lost confidence in integration. We need to turn this situation round as fast as we can. The programme that you have presented to us appears to be effective and well thought through, but priority should be given to those areas where somehow we can quickly and effectively demonstrate with real facts that Europe is better than no Europe. I should like to point out three such areas: the Balkans and Middle East questions, the fight against terrorism and the energy problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, a special opportunity is opening up in relation to energy, associated with the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. What better occasion could there be to go beyond mere words and to relaunch an institution that was introduced at that time and which would probably prove to be more useful today than it was then?</p>
<p class="contents">A Euratom II might let us address at European level something that cannot be done everywhere at individual country level, and in which Europe cannot risk being left behind: I mean research and the management of sensitive stages, such as enrichment and waste disposal. Think about it, Chancellor, and, in the meantime, good luck! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I begin by congratulating you on your early meeting with the American President. For too long there has been an apparent schism between Europe and the United States and it is time to move things in the right direction. You are laying some solid groundwork for future cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome some of the key measures outlined in your Presidency work programme – the emphasis on economic reform, the need for less regulation and your emphasis on the fight to combat climate change which should concern us all far more from now on. As a British Conservative, needless to say I do not welcome the emphasis on resurrecting the European Constitution. This could reinforce a sense of alienation within Europe which would be unhelpful and would complicate matters at a time when we need to make some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the remarks of the former President, Mr Herzog, are very important and he has deep concerns at the possibility of centralising forces in the EU. I believe that there is much the nations of Europe can do working together, and as the leader of my party has said, it is because we want to see a future for the EU and believe in a strong Europe that we want to see it confront its failings. I agree with that. </p>

Germany is strong enough to turn the rudder around. Those who voted ‘no’ must not be allowed to set our course. Come June, there will have to be some plain speaking done. What is needed is a renewed basic treaty to restore the Union’s effectiveness, or else a two-speed Europe is inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">It was originally five Member States that gave us freedom of movement and the Schengen Agreement. The eurozone is the heart of Europe; it has a lower rate of inflation than the USA or the United Kingdom. The Prüm Convention sets new benchmarks in the fight against crime. We are all in favour of tolerance, Mrs Merkel, but the moment of truth for the nay-sayers and the freeloaders must come all the same. That also applies in the fields of energy and climate change. Out of 180 member states of the United Nations, only 30 have signed up to the Kyoto commitments. Last year, the fact that the EU was responsible for 14% of the world’s CO2 emissions was attributable not to our having improved so much but rather to others putting out more of it. This is what makes energetic energy diplomacy long overdue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying something about the internal market. The market lives by free competition, but it cannot do everything. As one very intelligent woman said recently, the Commission sees policy as a distortion of competition. It and its officials must get back to acknowledging the primacy of policy-making. Europe is not merely a market, but also, and most urgently, a service meeting the public's social needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As if that were not enough, it has now emerged that Germany plans to impose its line on the Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies, which will follow its own. This involves adopting a single line in relations with Russia, at a time when presidential and parliamentary elections are to take place there. It amounts to toeing the German line.</p>
<p class="contents">Consider the implications this will have for us, ladies and gentlemen. Germany is to renegotiate the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement on behalf of the Union. The agreement is now to be more pragmatic than regulatory in nature, and there is a danger that the negotiators will not take the interests of former Soviet bloc countries into account. That has been evident in the case of the undersea pipeline across the Baltic and also in connection with the cargo ferry between Baltijsk and Sassnitz. Bilateral relations between Germany and Russia are to be repackaged as Union relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The revival of the rejected Constitution has a bearing on all this too. As it stands, the Constitution is beneficial to the largest Member State of the Union, because it deprives smaller ones of the right of veto.

<p class="contents">I am also delighted to have heard the speech by Mrs Merkel, particularly the first part of it. I believe that a political leader is someone whose political action is guided by their vision, and today we have seen a lot of that vision, and that is necessary, Mrs Merkel, because in Europe today there are too many accountants, too many prophets of doom, too many people who complain about everything, and I believe that we need a little vision, founded upon values and principles, in order to restore our dream. I therefore congratulate you.</p>
<p class="contents">I also congratulate you on having made the Constitutional Treaty the German Presidency’s priority from the outset. President Barroso has explained why the Constitutional Treaty is better than the existing Treaties very well. That is a reality that nobody denies. If we compare what we have to the Constitutional Treaty, the Constitutional Treaty comes out infinitely better.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, also a psychological reason: many Europeans believe that Europe will be in crisis until the constitutional issue is resolved, and therefore, in order to put an end to this interminable crisis, we must find a response.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe, Mrs Merkel, that this is the day to give us the key aspects of the response. That is not possible. We still have much talking to do. But you have said something. You have said: ‘I want the European Commission and the European Parliament to be consulted’. I would like to say to you that, in my view, consultation is not enough. The European Commission and the European Parliament must take part in the solution. They must participate because history shows that governments essentially put national interests first and the interests of everybody else second, and the Commission and Parliament, which are European institutions, institutions for everybody, have a more general vision.</p>

We agree with the priorities she formulated where foreign policy is concerned; her view that stability in the Balkans depends on a European perspective is one with which we could not agree more, and it is good that that has been confirmed here on behalf of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The most urgent issue is, of course, as Mrs Merkel observed, that of Kosovo, where some form of independence appears inevitable. The question now is what the European Union can do to make a solution of that kind acceptable to Serbia, and in some ways also to Russia, which has declared itself unwilling to accept an agreement that has not been thrashed out with Serbia in the Security Council. I hope that the presidency can contribute in the shape of an active dialogue with the Serbian Government following the elections there at the end of this week or the beginning of next week, but will also capitalise on our good relations with Moscow in a bid to find a solution that is acceptable to everyone. In this connection, we definitely want to distance ourselves from the comparison that is sometimes drawn by Moscow, where the issue of Kosovo is lumped together with conflicts in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to my second point. You have made a number of observations with regard to relations with Russia. We agree that a balanced approach must be found which can accommodate economic relations, energy, human rights, as well as the situation in Russia itself and the issue of a number of conflicts in the shared neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the next few months, you will be able to take a balanced approach when working on these three issues, not least in the framework of the negotiations about a new partnership agreement. As I see it, the European Union must now make an effort in order to be able to help find solutions for the issues of Transnistria, with reference to Moldova, but also with regard to the problems Georgia is facing. These are the three core elements, and I hope that in the next few months, you will be able to work them out whilst maintaining the right balance in your dealings with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is equally important that you receive the same sustained applause in your farewell speech in six months' time. Many have received a great deal of applause and been sent off with their tail between their legs, such as Mr Blair from Great Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">So if you are to receive a good round of applause at the end of your term of office, you will need to remain consistent in your opinions, with the consistency for which Germany has been known in the past and which we have seen fail recently. You have changed opinion several times on Turkey; I would like to believe that you will remain consistent in one view. We at least need that because, just yesterday, your ambassador called on Turkey in Ankara, saying that we would finance trade in the occupied area.</p>
<p class="contents">You come from a country which is almost occupied and you know what occupation means. So will you finance the occupying army? Call for the occupying army to leave Cyprus and openly finance the northern part of Cyprus. You cannot, however, finance the occupying army.</p>
<p class="contents">You must also make sure that there are equal rights. Here in this Chamber we have a German President, a German chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a German leader of the socialist opposition and even a German leader of the Greens. There should be equality for all groups. So demonstrate respect for the smaller countries and you will make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I have this to say: Madam Chancellor, remember that Moscow is a two-hour flight from Berlin, while Washington is nine hours away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We MEPs from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have great expectations of the German Presidency. Europe today needs new impetus and courage.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Chancellor, we look to the German Presidency to move the constitutional process beyond the current crisis. Today there are very real dangers on account of the delay. If by the end of 2008 we will have not closed this matter, and if the unresolved question of the Constitution becomes the main topic of the 2009 elections to the European Parliament, then we simply add fuel to the fire of marginal political forces.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a danger that these forces, with their shrill and destructive campaigns, may get elected to the next European Parliament in much greater numbers than before, and the current crisis may be accompanied by a serious institutional crisis. Parliament’s decision-making process could grind to a halt. We do not wish to see this happen, and therefore we must take urgent action.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States on the eastern borders of the newly reunified Europe are much more dependent upon external suppliers of energy. This is not merely an economic dependence, but there is today a real danger that former political influence will be rebuilt by means of economic tools. This matter is of concern not only to the new Member States, but to all of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A common European approach to energy policy is more important today than ever. The advantages of cooperation in this regard are clearer than day. If we work together, we are strong, but if we opt for separate deals on energy policy, others will get the better of us. The new Member States are counting on solidarity to help reduce their dependence, not only in their own interests but for the sake of Europe as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore my appeal today is that following this speech, with its great vision and great ambitions, we must make that become reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one month ago at my Congress of the European Social Democratic Parties, we gave you an idea for a roadmap for a better social Europe, because we need better, not less, social policies. We are proposing to you a roadmap for reviewing and modernising our social model and making it more dynamic. We call it ‘The New Social Europe’. It is about ensuring the continuation of our welfare states in the global economy; it is about ensuring that the market is the servant and not the master of people.</p>
<p class="contents">You talked wisely about talent, technology and tolerance. I want to add just one thing: yes, yes, yes, but for all and in a coherent society and based on the concept of freedom, which is also – as you know and have underlined on other occasions – that you are not free if you do not have a job, you are not free if you do not feel secure, and you are not free if you cannot see your future.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that your fight with other governments will be hard. Let me give you just one commitment from our side: when you fight with the Polish, with all your colleagues in the European Council, I think that we in the European Parliament have a duty to support you to make progress on that roadmap by telling our governments that it is not only about thinking about their own states but also about the Community.</p>

The Presidency’s goals to continue the full liberalisation of Europe’s postal services markets and its commitment to complete the creation of the internal market in gas and electricity are highly laudable. I hope that, by using its influence, Germany will indeed manage to achieve a shift in Europe’s security of energy supply policy, and that this will include forging a unified policy with Russia which has support from all the Member States. All in all, most of the Presidency’s programme should be seen as a genuine instrument for furthering the process of integration in the Union and garnering the support of European citizens. In my view, the same cannot be said of the Presidency’s first priority, which is to return to the debate on the Constitution. The rejection of the Constitution by two large Member States is, at the least, a signal that the European Union has become too distant and incomprehensible even for voters in the founding Member States. I was one of the members of the European Convention who urged that we should not write a European Constitution, but instead improve the existing treaties to bring the European Union closer to citizens in the Member States, both large and small, old and new. I urge the same course of action today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make it perfectly plain that what we jointly drafted in the Convention was the right response to Roman Herzog’s analysis of the need for the national parliaments to be involved at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also, however, appeal to our counterparts in the national parliaments to do their duty. When I consider just how much of what has been accused of ultimately tending to centralise Europe is attributable to the initiatives of Councils of Ministers, then I have to be frank in saying that these things were concocted, not, Mr President of the Commission, by the Commission in Brussels, and not by the European Parliament meeting in this place, but, in the main, by the Ministers with their several responsibilities meeting in Councils of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore find it very regrettable that our friend Mr Cohn-Bendit is no longer present, for he came up with a very pertinent analysis of the way intergovernmental cooperation functions, citing as an example the Treaty of Nice, which goes back to the year 2000, and having something to say about the work of the Intergovernmental Conference that followed the Convention. In response to all that, though, I would point out that, at that time, it was his old friend and fellow commune-resident from his Frankfurt days, his fellow-Green, Joschka Fischer, who, as foreign minister, bore some responsibility for this, so, instead of boring this House with it, these things ought better to be discussed in his commune.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final comment to make on this: we are talking about the social Europe, something that we all want, but the question arises of what this Europe of ours can afford if it is to be social. What do the Member States have to do to give people a social home? I do not believe that we can solve problems by handing more and more over to Brussels, but rather by delegating downwards where matters such as responsibility and social security are concerned; that is the only way in which we will get anywhere. We wish you much success in your Presidency, and will support you to the best of our abilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly liked what she said about that house having a soul and about the need for us to find it.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that building a house involves a variety of people. It involves architects; many of the architects have now spoken. It also involves, though, small-time artisans, and those who have to add the finishing touches to the work, and such artisans are an honourable trade, among whose number I count myself. You have to be rather careful what tools these craftsmen are allowed to get their hands on. I would ask you not to allow the couple of references you have made to the subject to be taken too far.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all alongside you and alongside those who advocate cutting back bureaucracy, but it is when that is used as a means of agitating against regulations that we actually need that I have a problem with it, for a proper community cannot live without proper rules. As our former President, Mr Borrell, said, ‘better lawmaking’ does not mean the absence of regulation; that is what you have to look out for, and, above all, you should also take care that the European Union is not always left to introduce those rules alone.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want to press on with cutting back bureaucracy, then you will have to take action, not only at Member State level, but also across the European Union as a whole, for I can tell you from personal experience of the way things are in my own country – although I cannot speak about the situation in other Member States – that the bureaucratic hindrances thrown up by the Member State itself are far more numerous than those originating from the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">It is these same qualities that the people of Europe expect from you, Mrs Merkel, when it comes to outlining our future prospects. As you said, as far as the Constitutional Treaty is concerned, the time for reflection has passed, the time for negotiation has come and soon will come the time for decision making. Rest assured that you will have all the support you could wish for from our group when it comes to overcoming the current difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priority is to find a solution that enables Europe to make effective decisions, a solution that respects the people who endorsed the Constitution, those who rejected it, and also those who have not yet expressed an opinion on it. An institutional reform that is focused on improvements on which there is consensus strikes me as being a beneficial option in the short term. It would enable the Union to make progress on a number of significant issues and thus to restore the citizens’ faith in their institutions. It is a matter of responding in a precise manner to the expectations and concerns of our fellow citizens faced with the major challenges of our times: the means of acquiring economic, industrial and scientific power, demographics, co-development, the management of migratory flows, energy security and climate change, food security, the preservation of our social models and also the dialogue between cultures and religions, integration and the rise in power of China, India and a great many other emerging countries.</p>

This House has – in both cases by a very large majority – adopted two resolutions on the subject, in which we state that the treaty, as negotiated and signed, is the starting point for all discussions, and, in this case as in others, the <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda </span>rule applies, so that trust may prevail between what are now twenty-seven Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One possible solution could be solidity in substance combined with flexibility in form. What we would find unacceptable would be a mini-treaty that would contain institutional rules and nothing else, and would – to use your own words – deny Europe a soul, the ‘soul’ meaning all those elements with which people deal directly, things like not only the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also all the elements of direct and indirect democracy such as the citizens’ initiative, the strengthening of this House’s citizens’ chambers and also of our counterparts in the national parliaments. If this constitution is to be acceptable to this House, then those are the things that will have to be in it.</p>
<p class="contents">A shorter constitution might perhaps be one way of dealing with the crisis. What we have here is a book of 448 articles that hardly anyone can read and understand, and the third part of which is simply wrong-headed. Work will have to be done on producing a document with perhaps 100 articles that can be read in any school classroom. As for the timetable, I would recommend that this be completed perhaps as early as the Portuguese Presidency, since the problem has to be got out of the way before the next European elections. In that, Mrs Merkel, you will have this House’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you that Mr Schulz is not absent-minded and that he does not say things without thinking first.</p>
<p class="contents">Our efforts are focused on the constitutional treaty, and so are our expectations of your presidency. If I might use your image of the European house, it is a house in which there is an audible murmuring, a house in which everyone would like to live, but the fact that the Netherlands and France have said ‘no’ means that the constitutional treaty is straddling two levels – the councils and governments on the one hand and the citizens on the other, and it is obvious that it has, for the moment, been brought down not by the councils and governments, but by the public, which is why it is they that we must endeavour to win round. The proverbial sixty-four thousand dollar question is: how are we going to do that?</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to your image of the European house, we all want to live in it, but the people who actually do, want to organise the interior decorating themselves. The interior décor of the European house is subject to too many European rules, and that tends to make people annoyed. There is excessive European regulation, including of things that do not need to be regulated by Europe at all. In many cases, this is attributable to the requirements of national governments, but occasionally – with all due respect to its President – to the Commission’s excessive enthusiasm for regulating things. That is why the reduction of bureaucracy is an essential consideration, and you have our fullest support in trying to achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And it is here that we have come to a standstill. Everything rests on you, Portugal, Slovenia and France: this matter needs to be settled in the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to express a few ideas. As far as the word ‘constitution’ is concerned, do not dig your heels in; this is an issue that angers people: there are countries that do not have one and there are countries that have had too many of them. As regards the preamble, do not meddle with it too much, because people are going to argue in the good Lord’s name, and, having consulted him, ‘He’ believes it to be a very good preamble: do not change a word of it. As regards the institutions, keep the bloc, keep the core and leave it at that. As regards the charter, make it a rule of law. Our British friends may not be too fond of that idea. Perhaps we ought to give them a little time. You know full well that they always come round after a while. Let us be patient.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the third part, let us take what is new from the social clause for public services and let us ratify more or less at the same time. You do not have a right to referendums; we are obsessed with holding referendums, as you well know. Be that as it may, let us ratify more or less at the same time. As regards the revision, be more flexible and heed Jean Monnet’s advice: ‘Nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Support for the European dream is falling due to the lack of a clear vision of the future. There are signs that the German Presidency could break the current impasse, but it will have to cope with difficult challenges. I should like to mention three issues in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to the revival of the constitutional process. Europe needs new institutional solutions, so it can act efficiently, effectively and more democratically. We trust the German Presidency will present a road map leading to the adoption of a new treaty in the course of the next two years. Such a treaty should strengthen the Union, enable it to act more efficiently, and enhance solidarity and competitiveness. It should equip the Union to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Eastern dimension of the European Union’s foreign policy requires strengthening. Our policy towards our Eastern neighbours needs to be firmer and more consistent. It should be governed by the principles of effectiveness and solidarity and the need to promote democracy and reform. We are confident that other countries, including Poland, will be involved in work on this policy. Poland can contribute vital knowledge and experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue I would like to raise concerns the security and reliability of energy supplies. Europe urgently needs a common energy policy aimed at ensuring the security of supplies, solidarity, and the lifting of barriers in the common market in energy. Investment in new sources of energy is also called for. It is to be hoped that Germany will be able to come up with a common policy based on the common interests of the Member States and solidarity between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor, Europe is suffering from a leadership crisis. Germany must live up to its responsibilities as the largest Member State of the European Union. The German Presidency has to be successful, not just for Germany’s sake but for all our sakes, for the sake of the European Union as a whole. I wish you that success, Chancellor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have also made use of such European programmes as Interreg, Leonardo and Socrates, so that, on the frontiers, regions have come into being that are constituted as European, and that will be the prescription for the future too. It is not behind closed doors, but among people together, that Europe comes into being.</p>
<p class="contents">Back home in Belgium, our Prime Minister Martens once told us not to allow anyone to prevent us from building bridges; that is what we have to do – build bridges between the twenty-seven Member States.

<p class="contents">The people are today asking Europe to provide solutions to those problems of theirs that the Member States and the regions cannot solve.

<p class="contents">Firstly, there are those to do with the constitutional treaty. With all due respect to Mr Cohn-Bendit, I must of course object to his comparison of the Council with a darkroom. I do not think that characterising the Council as a darkened room into which the light of transparency – in the shape of your House – shines, is an accurate description of the relationship between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaties of Rome were the Council’s handiwork, and Parliament can be said to have emerged from them. We want Parliament to be of major importance as a venue for wide-ranging debate, for we must not forget that it is you, its Members, who bring Europe to the people, you who are a vitally important link alongside all the other opinion-formers, but I would also ask you to bear in mind that the representatives of the governments – which are themselves, of course, democratically elected too – are doing their work to the best of their knowledge and ability, and that the only way we will be truly effective is for the Commission, the Council and your House to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the subject of a referendum, to which reference has been made, I will be frank and say that I have no time for the idea of a referendum on the same day throughout Europe, or in the countries where one can be held, and not only because Germany would not be able to take part in it, but also because we need to make clear what is stated in the constitutional treaty, namely that it is the Member States that have the final word where the Treaties are concerned – that is the fact of the matter, and that is why it is the Member States that must decide for themselves whence the legitimacy of this treaty is to be derived, and what shape it should take, in order then to transfer powers to Europe. I would also say, however, that I favour a democratic Europe in which the Commission and Parliament work very closely together.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, are we now to proceed? The situation is, of course, a complex one; we all know that. We have to take the existing Treaty as our starting point. I am highly sceptical about the idea that another Convention will be of any use to us now. We have to endeavour to move forward those things that the Convention got right, some of which the Council then altered, and there is scope for a long debate about those.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something I would like to say to our friends from the United Kingdom. What makes your attitude almost antagonistic is that this constitutional treaty is one that gives the national parliaments more of a say, setting boundaries more clearly and achieving clarity, and the opposition to this constitutional treaty on the part of those who want greater clarity, more of a say, and more subsidiarity, makes matters so much more difficult for us since our recognition of the need for greater public involvement was the very reason why it was drafted in the first place. The treaty now gives people the opportunity to lodge appeals; it enables us to speak with one voice where powers are at the European level, but also makes us hold back more when they are located elsewhere. The simple request I have to make of you – and yes, I know it will be hard for me to make myself heard – is that you should not commit an historic mistake by preventing Europe from taking a step in that very direction in which many of you want it to go.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">After all, the only practical thing we can do is to carry out confidential consultations and find out, for a start, precisely what objections the various Member States are having to deal with. The time for highly generalised debates about whether the thing is needed in the first place and how one should go about this or that is long gone; we now have to tackle very specific things, or else I do not think we are going to achieve our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate something to which I only very discreetly alluded in my speech earlier, that those who are so keen on enlargement – and I am not necessarily one of them – must be aware that, if they, at the same time, take a sceptical view of the constitutional treaty, then, the present legal basis being what it is, enlargement is not going to happen.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely the point we are reaching with Croatia, which will perhaps be the next candidate for accession, but it has to do with the whole of the Western Balkans too. As I said, we have thousands of soldiers stationed there. What do we have to look forward to? Disputes about whether we are going to move forward, and, if so, how?</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside for a moment the question of whether a meeting now would be well-advised as the way to proceed, we will, in the course of our presidency, take care that members are not divided into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, but that we achieve a result together. It has to be said, though, that those eighteen Member States that have already ratified, have done so in the full conviction that this was the right thing to do. Germany is one of them. These eighteen are certainly not going to say, ‘OK, let us do something about enlargement and let everything else go hang’. Europe will certainly not work like that. That is why we have to take on board the fact that the draft constitutional treaty has already been ratified by 18 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That, for today, is all I have to say about the constitutional treaty. We will of course keep you informed about it. We will be meeting in Berlin with that purpose in mind and will then have another meeting in June. I hope that your House will be supportive, and ask those who have sounded a sceptical note today to have a rethink about it all.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do agree on is that climate change and energy are crucial issues, and it is for that reason that the Commission has come up with a number of proposals, many of which I think are absolutely spot-on, and the President has already had something to say about them. A number of them will have to be discussed at Council level. I shall do everything possible to ensure that the Council on 8/9 March produces as specific a response as possible to the Commission’s big package, and that will not be easy.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has ever looked into the subject of energy will know that the cooperative line currently taken by the Council is, in essence, in advance of the Constitution, for, where powers are concerned, it is in the Constitution that that issue of energy is mentioned for the first time, in a modern response to the challenges we face.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of European integration began with coal and steel. In our modern society, energy efficiency, security of energy supply, solidarity between the Member States and foreign policy in relation to energy assume the same importance that coal and steel did then.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can find no answer to these problems, then we really are in trouble. Climate change is of course one of them, and another, self-evidently, is the need to promote renewable energies, to improve energy efficiency and promote the admixture of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have to say to Mr Cohn-Bendit is that nuclear power will, of course, continue to be a bone of contention. Speaking personally, and as one who is all in favour of it, let me say that I believe that we must nevertheless apply some vigour to saving energy and finding renewable varieties of it. I believe that these must not be seen as mutually contradictory but should instead be seen as belonging together.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about the social state model, and it is that Europe is unthinkable without it. It is because globalisation has put this social state model under pressure that we must consider how we can continue to guarantee people’s standard of living; it will not be easy. In 1900, Europeans made up 26% of the world’s population; we now make up something between 12% and 14%, and, by the beginning of the twenty-second century, that figure will have dropped to 4% or 5%. We must see to it that we hang on to what we have worked so hard for.</p>
<p class="contents">I have looked into this. The Council has already decided that impact assessments are needed in social security matters too, and it will be again asking the Commission to make more use of them, to the point where it becomes normal practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, though, that Germany’s experience of the social market economy has been that it makes it possible for capital and labour to be reconciled, and so I ask you not to make us play the one off against the other. There are those who want less bureaucracy, and there are others who want to defend social provision. The two are not contradictory; on the contrary, in the European social state model, they belong together. That is why, of course, freedom without the necessary social conditions is no more than highly deficient or not even viable at all. It is only through freedom, competition and confidence in people that individuals can be enabled once more to achieve something that makes for prosperity for every citizen. That ‘social’ always means compensating those who are weaker is not a matter of doubt; without that, the social market economy and the European social state model are not even conceivable.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I have two final comments to make, the first of which has to do with internal and justice policy. This week, in Dresden, an excellent informal council meeting was held. Yes, we are committed to the Prüm Convention! I believe that the common area of justice and security is something people want at a very fundamental level. Yes, of course, the balance between protection of data and the exchange of information is a recurrent topic of serious debate, and my less than total enthusiasm for the line taken by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has something to do with the fact that I would not be one of their members if I were a Member of your House, but this is a debate we will have to keep coming back to.</p>
<p class="contents">My last word has to be about the trimming of bureaucracy. The nation states know what they have to do. Although the constant mutual recriminations get us nowhere, the simple fact is that the much-lauded <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>has, over the years, grown rather than diminishing in size.</p>
<p class="contents">As I discovered from my own experience, one of the blessings of German reunification was that the German legal system became effective as a whole and at a stroke. If I may now make so bold as to speak for the new Member States that have been fortunate enough to be presented with the whole <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, so to speak, all on one plate, there are certain questions I would just like to raise. There is in fact nothing anti-European about wanting to review whether all our legislation is still relevant to present circumstances, about considering whether it has piled up to such a degree over time that some of it could be summarised, about looking to see if there are modern methods that make ten-page application forms redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">I will never forget seeing what the fishermen on Rügen in my electoral district did with the first applications for fisheries subsidies; they simply threw the forms in the waste-paper basket, because they could not imagine how they could ever complete them all.</p>
<p class="contents">This really is not about making things less certain; it is about making Europe – despite people’s experience of red tape – an attractive place in which it is possible to live, so, with that in mind, let us address that issue as well.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would just like to refer to some of the points that were highlighted during our very fruitful debate, especially now that Chancellor Merkel has also referred to energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers referred to energy and to the importance of energy in relation to third countries, namely Russia. Mr Daul said that we need to speak with a common voice externally – I agree. But let us be frank: to speak with one common voice externally, we cannot go on speaking with 27 different voices internally. We need a common market, an integrated market, for energy. We also need a clear energy policy internally. Without coherence we are not credible.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise the issue of energy very strongly because, apart from its value in itself, it is one of the most powerful drivers for the European project. Let us not forget that the European Communities started after the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. The same day that the Treaty of Rome was signed for the European Economic Community, the Euratom Treaty was also signed. Since the very beginning, energy has been at the core of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, if there is a matter where the idea of solidarity applies, it is precisely this issue of energy. But we are linking energy with climate change because climate change is one of the most important challenges – if not the most important challenge – of the 21st century. Our founding fathers could not make a reference to it in the Messina Declaration or in the Rome Treaties, but we now have a duty to put that as a very important global challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the nature of our European Union. The old question of more or less Europe belongs in the 20th century. The debate now is not whether we need Europe, but how to make it work properly and in a more efficient way. We need more efficient decision-making, more democratic accountability in an enlarged Europe and a more coherent external position of the European Union. Those are the basic reasons why we need a constitutional settlement, not because of any theological discussion about a superstate in Europe. No one is really proposing a superstate, a centralised state in Europe. What we are proposing is a European Union dimension that is indispensable to meeting the challenges of the 21st century. That is quite obvious! Even Germany, the biggest Member State, or Britain, France or Italy, cannot meet those challenges alone. That is why we need the added value of our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also look pragmatically at areas where we can do more and at areas where we can do less. One area where we can and should do less is bureaucracy. We have to reduce bureaucracy, and we must have better regulation to improve the conditions for our companies and for our citizens. Therefore, it is not a question of more, or less, Europe, but of a better Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If we work in the spirit of partnership we have seen today – of course, with democratic debate – between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we can achieve results during these six months. I should like to promise the President-in-Office and the President of Parliament that we will try to achieve real results during these six months so that our European Union can make progress and so that we can look forward to the next 50 years with hope and with pride.</p>

It gives meaning to European integration where a great many issues are concerned: more specifically, values, the institutions, the international role of the Union, the Doha Agenda, transatlantic relations, the partnership with Russia, the forthcoming Europe/Africa summit, energy and environmental issues, the development of our internal market and the need for better legislation in order to prevent bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments to make regarding the start of this presidency. I regret that the President-in-Office was not present during the election of the President of the European Parliament on Tuesday 16 January 2007. Moreover, pursuant to Article 105 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, I believe that, without prejudice to the objective of price stability, it would have been useful to have addressed the issue of how the euro can be used to serve EU economic policy. I will support this excellent programme, which was drafted in political agreement with the future Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies and which will be crucial to the major debates of the forthcoming European elections in 2009. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult not to agree with the priorities that have been outlined (growth, work and foreign policy) but, as I have pointed out on other occasions and Mr De Michelis has reiterated this morning, what we need before any conceivable strategy on either economic growth or diplomatic cooperation is, in my opinion, a sound energy self-sufficiency policy if, as we have seen, all it takes is a ship or a tree – not to mention the whims of a political leader – to bring economic activity to its knees for hours across entire regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a policy does not mean just cooperating with our partners, but also having a strategic plan aiming at research into clean and renewable energies and at their use in practice, especially by industry, so as to respond both to the challenge of energy supplies and to environmental problems. The EU has a duty to its own citizens to solve this problem, and it can set a good example that its international partners can follow for everybody’s benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It costs EUR 250 million per year for our taxpayers, not to mention the environmental damage caused by the hundreds of journeys and thousands of cars travelling between the two cities. During Strasbourg weeks MEPs spend their Mondays and Thursdays making unnecessary trips instead of working and meeting their voters. The German Government has a tough economic policy at home, and it recommends the same measures to other countries, like my homeland, Hungary. I hope the German Presidency will be brave enough to push forward the same economic reform in the EU, not allowing our taxpayers’ money to be thrown away. Let us respect our voters, let us respect the environment, let us encourage Chancellor Merkel to fight for a single seat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is an excellent approach. It would be difficult not to endorse the set of values underpinning Europe, such as diversity, freedom, tolerance, Christianity and mutual support. There is, however, one further value that should be added to the list, namely solidarity. Without a deep rooted sense of solidarity experienced not only by individual Member States but also by their citizens, it is difficult to conceive of a common European Union foreign policy and an EU Foreign Minister, for example. I therefore support President Barroso's proposal to make solidarity the top priority of the planned Berlin declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the current constitutional crisis will not be resolved unless we can inspire greater confidence amongst the citizens. One way of doing this would be to convince the citizens of the Community that their collective security is in safe hands with the European Union. In my experience, people have a very broad understanding of the concept of security, considering it to include solidarity over energy issues, neighbourhood policy, social security and relations with third countries attempting to set Europeans against each other. Solidarity could become Europe's strength, allowing us to disseminate our values. If there is no solidarity amongst us, we shall forfeit our unity and our ability to achieve our objectives.

Indeed, Europe has to regain its economic vitality in order to sustain growth and jobs in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing enormous tasks! The internal market must be carried to completion, the competitiveness of European businesses must be strengthened, our regulatory systems must be modernised. We have to move beyond the constitutional crisis, which jeopardises faith in the future of integration. Efforts must be made to improve economic growth and employment opportunities, to strengthen Europe’s global political and economic weight, to institute a common energy policy and climate protection and to create a European zone of security and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint fight against terrorism and organised crime cannot be put off, and we have to tackle the ever mounting flood of refugees. In addition, the menacing spectre of racism and xenophobia must prod the German Presidency to take a firm stand.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I welcome the emphasis given to the basic values that form the foundation of Europe. Let us not forget that 2007 is the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, a fundamental European value that may have been the first to be set down in the founding Treaties. The German Presidency’s motto is very pertinent here: ‘Europe can only succeed together’. All of us, together and in our own countries, have to work towards furthering equal opportunity. It is in this spirit that I announced, together with the competent Hungarian minister, the national programme of the 2007 Year of Equal Opportunities.</p>
