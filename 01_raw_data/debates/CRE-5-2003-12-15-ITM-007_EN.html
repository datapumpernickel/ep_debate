<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, last October, I presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market the new Commission proposal for a takeover bids directive. That proposal was aimed primarily at meeting the Parliament's criticism that the earlier proposal had not gone far enough in establishing a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">That proposal has been discussed and amended by Member States and, on 27 November 2003, the Competitiveness Council adopted a general orientation on a compromise text presented by the Italian presidency. On the same day, Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted Mr Lehne's report, based on the same compromise text.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would like to express my surprise about all the changes in this report between the vote of the Legal Affairs Committee and the plenary session. The proposal now on the table is based on the text, dated 7 May 2003, that was worked on during the Greek presidency including multiple voting rights in the scope of the breakthrough and draws on the suggestion put forward by the Portuguese delegation to introduce options for Member States and for companies in the application of Articles 9 and 11.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only repeat here what I already said in the Council. Articles 9 and 11 are crucial elements of this proposal. Article 9 contains the basic principle that the board of an offeree company may only take defensive measures after prior consultation of the general meeting of shareholders. Article 11 makes it possible for an offeror who has acquired 75% of the capital to break through certain defensive mechanisms set up by the offeree company. I indicated quite clearly during the discussions that I would not accept as a compromise the deletion of those Articles. Nor can I accept an arrangement whereby those Articles are to be made optional. That will not achieve the harmonisation that the Commission intended when it tabled this proposal. Moreover, it goes back on the level of harmonisation that we agreed last time, before Parliament objected to the first proposal on the grounds that it did not go far enough in establishing a level playing field. At the moment no level playing field whatsoever is established.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, you will not be surprised that I cannot accept Amendment 5 or Amendment 21, which introduce these optional arrangements. I have some difficulties as well with Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 20, last paragraph, concerning 'special rights'. This confuses rights in private law and those in public law, which are not covered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that time is running out and that we have already spent a great deal of time discussing this proposal. However, I do not think that we are sending the right message to the markets by adopting the proposal in its current form. Is it really a worthwhile contribution to our project which seeks to build the most competitive market in the world by 2010? I sincerely hope that we can do better, even if we need more time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Right now, I have no desire to go through everything that has happened in relation to it in the past. I share the Commissioner’s view that something more would have been desirable. I still believe that a better solution was represented by the joint initiative that we set in motion during the Greek Presidency of the Council with the aim of finding an overall solution that would create truly uniform conditions of competition in Europe. As tends to be the case with political change, we ended up having to make compromises, and the best is the enemy of the good. What we have before us is what was negotiated with the Italian Presidency and unanimously adopted in the Council as part of a political agreement and, in essence, the same as what was adopted by this House’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and by its Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. It is a compromise with which all parties can live under the prevailing circumstances, and that in itself shows that it is a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">We will achieve the goals of which the Commissioner spoke, but, for now, they do no more than indicate what is currently achievable in terms of European law. The rest we can leave to the markets. We have been given an objective to aim at, but, according to this proposal, it will ultimately be the markets that decide whether or not what is proposed is right, and in which direction things will change.</p>
<p class="contents">Having had in-depth discussions with the various Council Presidencies – starting with the Danes, then with the Greeks, and now with the Italians – we now have the opportunity of wrapping up this issue once and for all. The Italian Presidency of the Council has offered us the possibility of completing this procedure in one reading, and, as we are in any case approaching the end of this Parliament, I believe that we should make use of this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent months, the rapporteur and the committees were kept fully and regularly informed of the progress of the deliberations. People from all quarters of this House were involved. I therefore ask you to vote in favour of the Commission proposal. I cannot but note with regret that a number of groups have submitted amendments aimed in particular at further extending the rights of workers. It is with reference to them that I wish to make it clear that this compromise already includes workers’ rights; it is explicitly laid down in the compromise reached on Article 9, that the workers’ representatives have to be informed and that they can make a statement, which, together with the board’s statement, must be made available to the shareholders and to the public. By way of a compromise, Article 13 ensures that all existing rights of workers to participation and co-determination – be they put in place by the nation states or by Europe – are retained and remain unaffected by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too, I think, one must be amenable to compromise. Rather than constantly wanting to enforce pure doctrine, one must at some point reach a compromise. There is something positively paradoxical about a situation in which it is the Socialist governments in the Council that want to prevent workers gaining more rights – the examples I would give are the Swedes and the British Labour Government – while, here in this House, the Left, led by the Socialists, who are willing to let these directives and this proposal fail, even though their own governments, at Council level, are blocking these compromises that go even further.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise will, in my view, provide adequate protection for workers’ rights. There is no reason to go further. I would therefore ask you to reject these amendments, for, if you do not – for so we have been told in unambiguous terms by the Council – the whole of the compromise that has been achieved will be in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we approve this directive, this compromise, we will be demonstrating the European Union’s capacity to act in difficult times. It is for that reason that I ask you to vote in favour. We could now bring this never-ending story to a close.</p>
<p class="contents">I want especially to thank all the co-rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups. I want to make especial mention, by name, of Mr Huhne, with whom I have enjoyed the closest possible cooperation. We have run the Rule 162a – enhanced cooperation – procedure very well and have achieved a good result. What I ask this House to do is to bring this never-ending story to a full stop by voting in favour and letting the end of this year be marked by a real success for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully sympathise with what the Commissioner has said and those who argue that it will not create a level playing field in cross-border takeovers in the Union. There is no doubt about that. Member States will still be able to sanction their companies to take anti-bid measures with the approval of only the board and not of the shareholders. Therefore, it fails to deal with a major potential obstacle to cross-border takeovers and restructuring. The choice of whether to apply the rules is only a fig leaf to disguise that reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States, including some like Germany who proclaim themselves in favour of more political integration, are against foreigners taking over their own companies. In Britain we have many hang-ups but, fortunately, not that one. We have been losing foreign direct investment due to our failure to join the euro, but the signal that this part of the directive sends out about France and Germany may help to sustain Britain's share. For the euro area in particular this failure is a serious own goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Why then is this draft worth supporting? The provisions in this text to protect minority shareholders are important and will encourage more cross-border portfolio share ownership. By ensuring that there is a threshold in each Member State at which someone taking control of a company has to launch a full bid for the other shares, this directive stops creeping control of a company. It therefore means that a new shareholder with perhaps only 30% of the stock cannot decide, without providing an exit for all the other shareholders, to pay themselves special dividends or to sell off assets cheaply to another private company that they happen to control. By reassuring investors about those practices, by no means unknown in many Union financial markets, the directive will encourage more cross-border share ownership. That is crucial to the efficiency and returns on pension funds, for the support of the retired and for insurance funds for the compensation of the distressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, however, this is clearly a modest measure. It does no harm, it does some good. It sends the wrong signals but, in reality, it changes too little; it does not change anything in the reverse direction. Certainly calling it a takeover directive is a misnomer and would probably be a breach of the United Kingdom's Trades Descriptions Act. But all that is politically attainable at present. For those who would like to see more radical opening-up of cross-border mergers, there is also the promise of a clearer view in the next Parliament and the prospect that the markets themselves can add to the pressures on companies to apply best practice in consulting their shareholders. Transparency in this matter, as in others, may help, and we must not let the best be the enemy of the good.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally reiterate something on the debate with the Socialist Group on employee consultation. Mr Lehne, to whom I would like to pay tribute, has certainly worked very hard, as I did, on a text that would have satisfied the PSE Group, even though the position on takeovers, as we have seen, is effectively unchanged. Takeovers will not be made any easier but, nevertheless, the PSE Group wanted a form of words to provide some political concession, as if they were being made easier. In reality, that form of words in their amendments merely echoes what is already in the information and consultation directive. It provides employees with nothing new, but potential differences in the legal text between this draft directive if it is voted and that one could mean a risk of litigation over takeovers if it is voted through. For that reason, we should vote against these amendments and support what is, I agree, a flawed and partial compromise, but, nevertheless, one which makes some progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been somewhat overlooked in the whole debate, although we have already heard about the latest developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that the lack of arrangements for employees' information and consultation was one of the main reasons for rejecting the previous proposal for a directive on takeover bids in 2001. The Commission acknowledged that, to a certain extent, in providing us with Article 13, but our Employment and Social Affairs Committee was almost unanimous in its opinion that it was not enough. The Commission refers only to national Member States' practices and the Employment Committee's opinion explicitly makes information and consultation a mandatory part of takeover bid procedure, both for the companies making the bids – Article 6 – and the target companies – in Article 9.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group is still of that opinion, and over the last month I have prepared a text which is adapted to the situations in different Member States. This was a big concession to the United Kingdom, whose standards for takeover bids differ from those in the continental Member States. We also adapted the text to bring it into line with the provisions of the directive on the information and consultation of workers. That is why the references are there. So there is no real problem as regards differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing is that the main Articles of the directive should explicitly mention information and consultation. My Group wishes to stress that this should be a normal part of the procedure. That is made clear by three amendments that have now been re-tabled: Amendments Nos 35, 36 and 37, and by other amendments that have been tabled by the Verts/ALE and GUE/NGL Groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne, Mr Huhne and I had a compromise on this, but between Monday 24 November when these three amendments were adopted almost unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Thursday 27 November, before the Council took its position, they left the deal and voted against the three amendments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. That is why that compromise is not in there now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne's argument that it would have complicated the decision-making process is not convincing. The only reason he does not want this to be included is that he wants to press for a first-reading agreement, but in our opinion this takes away Parliament's right to have any input in the discussion. It is still early enough in the negotiations to make this input. The Italian presidency did discuss this seriously enough with the Council: there is still a chance to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group is ready to support the compromise, although we are not very enthusiastic about it. Our original position was to make a directive without Articles 9 and 11 protecting minority shareholders' rights. But we only want to support it if these three amendments are adopted. If that is not the case we will vote against the compromise package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the opinion that we put forward reflected the concerns of a majority of our members and those concerns were particularly directed at the need for, and importance of, employee information and consultation. A number of amendments concerned informing the employees of the target or offeree company, and another amendment concerned the importance of consulting the employees of the offeror or predatory company.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area of concern to us, where we were in line with a number of other committees, is the issue of jurisdiction. We felt it very important that jurisdiction should be in the Member State of the offeree company to avoid any ambiguity or confusion. We also put forward an amendment covering the issue of jurisdiction on bids originating from companies in countries outside the European Union – third countries – and the need for those to be subject to national authorisation within.</p>
<p class="contents">A third area of concern which was addressed in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was that of the Scandinavian countries in particular over multiple classes of shares.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne: the affair of the takeover bids directive really does seem to be never-ending. Starting life in January 1989 with the first Commission proposal, a proposal that was, moreover, ambitious, pursuing the objective of achieving a single market in corporate control, the progress of the takeover bids directive through the legislative process seems to have been a kind of obstacle course, with texts alternating between maximalist proposals unacceptable to some – the individual States and the Council of Ministers – and minimalist compromises unacceptable to others – the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Of this obstacle course, I remember that the European Parliament rejected a Conciliation Committee joint text on 4 July 2001<span class="bold">. </span>I also remember the extremely interesting Commission proposal of October 2002, drawn up after a group of high-level experts had been consulted. This proposal, in addition to preserving the passivity rule in Article 9, sought to achieve the objectives set by the European Parliament and the wise men consulted, the neutralisation of some pre-bid defensive measures and proportionality between risk capital and voting rights, while I am afraid the very points that we might call most dangerous such as large corporations and multiple voting rights were excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Another obstacle course has started, with regard to which we thought that the intuition of the Council Presidency in June 2002 provided a way out: giving the Member States and quoted companies respectively the possibility of choosing between the directive’s model with the passivity rule and the neutralisation of defensive measures - type A companies - or preservation of defensive measures - type B companies - all supplemented by a requirement of maximum transparency in a system to which a company is subject.</p>
<p class="contents">To put all the operators on a level playing field, provision is made for type A companies to decide not to let themselves be taken over by a type B company. The solution has many advantages: it shows which is the ideal solution – type A, the benchmark – and creates reciprocity. Moreover, the neutralisation of defensive measures requires an initial uniform rule of European company law: Article 11, which provides for the options, is essentially a derogation from the usual system. These options can be withdrawn once the market, favouring type A companies, has created the right conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is more. With the current system, quoted companies subject to systems which do not provide for passivity rules or neutralisation can opt for competitiveness, which would not be possible without the directive. Moreover, the maximum transparency of company systems<span class="bold"> </span>and internal rules required by both Article 10 of the proposal for a directive and the parallel proposal for a directive on the transparency of quoted companies - which is also currently being debated in Parliament and the Council - ensures that companies which fully accept Articles 9 and 11, the stars, are the true European companies and clearly identifiable as such. In this way, it is made possible for the market to reward them. Indeed, institutional investors should explain to their clients why they are investing in non-competitive, type B companies rather than in a competitive, type A company.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the compromise, providing for preventive partial takeover bids, allows many countries not to make substantial changes to their legislation, while, at the same time, it does not risk<span class="bold"> </span>exposing companies to unfair competition from companies in other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I am doing so, however, it is also the case that, when it appears that a high degree of consensus has been reached on certain issues, it is good to consider what has happened, at least so that, if not in this case, then certainly in the future, we can draw conclusions on how parliamentary tasks are carried out within the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore going to focus exclusively on two aspects of the first occasion on which – as all the honourable Members will remember – during this legislature, Parliament did not approve the text of the Conciliation Committee, which was basically in line with the text of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these aspects will allow me to remind the honourable Members of the different formulae which were considered on the initiative of the European Parliament in terms of regulating administration bodies’ neutrality obligation and comparing them – where appropriate – with the formulae now being presented. And in view of this comparison I do not believe that what we are going to approve today improves on what on that previous occasion had been proposed, at least by the European Parliament. Because at that time this House proposed maintaining the administration bodies’ neutrality obligation – which is positive – although, simply for certain cases in which it is not possible for the board of directors to meet, it proposed certain formulae, which were not accepted by the Council or by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening now? Well it has only been possible to reach a consensus by greatly reducing the Commission’s initial proposals. Ultimately, by not regulating the section relating to the neutrality obligation and consequently allowing the legislations of the Member States to regulate, by means of handy subsidiarity, issues relating to the prohibition or non-prohibition of defensive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that this is a good formula for legislation. I believe that, if certain proposals presented by Parliament had been approved at that time, we would have had more suitable legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect – which has been mentioned by my colleague, Mrs van den Burg – relates to the chapter on information and consultation for workers. I would like to point out that, on that occasion, a large majority of Members of Parliament approved rights to information and consultation for workers which were shared by the immense majority of these Members. Some people pointed out on that occasion that there had been an alliance between certain conservative sectors and the Socialists, as a result of which the former had obtained flexible treatment for the prohibition of defensive measures, while the latter obtained broad recognition of the participation of workers. At that time it was also proposed that we Socialists should break the pact and vote in favour of the proposals in the common position in exchange for recognising the workers’ right to information.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, on that occasion we did not do so, but – as Mrs van den Burg has said – if this aspect is not recognised and if the relevant amendments are not approved we will be obliged to vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The current proposal leaves a great deal of scope for Member States and companies themselves, such as a company's optional, or even temporary, permission to take defensive mechanisms when it is faced with what it views as a hostile takeover bid. The question can therefore be posed whether takeovers are still to be possible at European level and whether this directive will, in practice, make any actual change to the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I think that we should approve this proposal, even if it were to finally end the discussion in the European Union about takeover bids – which has been going on for thirteen years now – and set up a first, albeit hesitant, regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to a Flemish saying, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The takeover directive is indeed an important component of the Lisbon agenda on a strong, competitive European Union and is essential to the further completion of the European internal market. We should therefore ensure that this directive enters into force as soon as possible, so that we, along with the market operators, can immediately learn whether, and how, we can give this regulation more depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eventually, the matter went back to the Commission, which has had ample time available to it, and it might therefore have been thought that the proposal had been developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, a compromise is being presented between different owner constructions and owner interests, but still no concern is being shown for the employees. I think that is incredibly strange. It must be obvious that the employees, just like the shareholders, are interested parties in takeover situations, and it is unrealistic to ignore the fact. In a way, the employees are perhaps interested parties to an even greater degree than the shareholders, because hostile takeover bids are almost always combined with plans for restructuring and, perhaps, cut-backs.</p>
<p class="contents">In other contexts, we talk solemnly about the social dialogue in the European employment strategy as progress in EU policy. We talk about the Lisbon strategy in which the two sides of industry and the social dialogue are also important. In the present context, all this is conspicuous by its absence, and the old idea still prevails that companies only belong to their owners and that, in general, the employees are no more important than machines or other loose fittings. It is an old-fashioned, unrealistic and out-of-date idea. There can be no legislation on takeover bids that is not in some way grounded in the fact that a company is also its employees. That is absolutely fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall of course support the amendments concerning improved information and consultation. Information is, of course, important, but I want at the same time to say that it is not enough. It must be possible, in one way or another, to use information for something. There must be certain rights. The employees must have certain opportunities to act in situations such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">If the matter were now to go back to the Commission, I should like to give Mr Bolkestein a piece of advice. I think that the offeror should also be required to present an adjustment plan for the new company that is coming into being. A development and adjustment programme of this kind should also take account of the employees’ interests and talk about what will happen to them. There should also be a guarantee against at least short-term dismissal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is worth reminding ourselves that although technically we are now at first reading, this is in fact a fourth reading, even just for those of us who have participated in the present Parliament. We have been through this a long way and I myself am one of those who think that if we can bring it to a successful conclusion this time, then we should do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the point made by Mr Huhne and Mr Bolkestein that there are further problems we did not have before. It is perhaps a little like the story of the Sybilline Books. The first time they were offered as a set of 12 and Tarquin refused them. Three of them were then burned and they were offered as a set of nine at a higher price: each time the price goes up and the quality goes down. Maybe that is so, or maybe not, but we are now in a position where we have to make up our minds.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group is firmly of the conviction that we must take full and proper account of employees' rights in this context. Employees are not just pawns on the chess board. Employees are the people who make companies work and make them function effectively. Their interests have to be taken fairly and fully into account. Their right to consultation and information has to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">On that account, my Group will certainly vote for the sets of amendments agreed between us, the GUE/NGL Group and the PSE Group when the vote is held tomorrow. Thereafter we are of two minds: some of us are firmly of the view that we should adhere to this to the last, and that if they are not carried then we will vote against the directive in its present form. If that means the compromise collapses then it will simply have to go to second reading, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Others - and I am one of those others - think that the time has come to reach a conclusion. I shall vote for these amendments, but at the end of the day I shall try to get this through at this reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need to understand each other: I believe that calling this a takeover bids directive – as Mr Huhne said earlier - is an exaggeration. What we are doing here is acknowledging that there are different regulations and guaranteeing to the different countries that they can maintain protectionist legislation with regard to their companies, their national public or private market leaders. I believe that we needed to go much further, to decide whether to aim at an integrated, effective, competitive European capital market which would provide fresh opportunities for growth for the European Union, not least in the field of employment, or not to take this so-called ‘risk’ and remain in our current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules, as proposed by the Council, eliminate very few of the obstacles that some States’ rules place in the way of companies’ competitiveness, with the result that I am sad to say that hostile bids – as are the norm in a mature financial market, in which capital is moved where there are thought to be efficiency margins to recover, in the interests of the companies and the workers of those companies and of other companies, in the interests of the consumers of products, goods or services – become impossible. There is also the risk that this crystallisation of the current situation will take us a step backwards. In Italy, where the current legislation – the Draghi law – is extremely open and effective from this point of view, we are already being asked to take a step backwards, and I would point out that we are not going so far in Europe in opening up to the competitiveness of companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, should this measure – which is not, I repeat, a takeover bids directive – be adopted tomorrow by Parliament too, it will generate genuine competition between legal systems and ensure that those systems in which takeover bids are penalised and obstructed pay the price for it through having their international investors ‘vote with their feet’. There are very few positive elements: recognition of the protection of the rights of minorities and the sunset clause - the idea that the debate on the issue can be reopened. Maybe for this reason alone, it is worth adopting this measure, which is not a European law on takeover bids.</p>

However, it did so on that day some two-and-a-half years ago when Parliament rejected the takeover directive. Nothing I have seen or heard since then has made me change my mind that what we did was not only wrong but also foolish. In an increasingly interdependent world, where the globe's economy is seamlessly linking together, the single greatest economic challenge we face in Europe – a challenge which we lose at our peril - is global competitiveness. We all know that we are very good at talking about it and we are equally bad at doing anything material to address the problem. Furthermore, whenever Europe has to face up eyeball to eyeball to the challenges posed by competitiveness, we funk it. We funked it that day two-and-a-half years ago, and we have regularly funked it since. We always use special pleading about the minutiae as an intellectual fig leaf to avoid the tough decisions. It must be said that it is all pretty transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">To set the picture straight: I may be a British Conservative, but I am not the contemporary equivalent of the hard-faced men who made money out of the war. I am no Thatcherite – never have been – and I am not a Eurosceptic, but I think – some consider this to be an eccentric point of view – that we should deal with the world as it is and not the world as we would like it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is to deliver for its citizens – and it has to – our economy has to be competitive. Part of that state of competitiveness is to have a system of company law and capital markets that enables it to compete. It does not now, and that problem has to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals we are debating this afternoon are a miserable, insufficient response to today's world. However, we have to start from where we are. I hope Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to confirm that in the event of this proposal becoming law further proposals will follow this one, taking the matter forward – and rather more quickly than this one has been taken because, if it is not taken more quickly, if I am lucky I will be drawing my pension and if I am unlucky I shall be dead.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is a single, wretched, shuffling step on the journey that Europe has to take. There is no choice. It is for that reason we shall support it as long as Mr Lehne's proposals are not amended or watered down. On balance – just – it is worse to reject it than to support it and for a Conservative that is a good enough reason to vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I honestly did not know that there were 275 German MEPs in this House. That is how many Members rejected the results of the first conciliation procedure. Ladies and gentlemen, when we consider Europe as a social community and as an example to others, workers’ rights have an important part to play. It was because they were not sufficiently taken into account that the first takeover directive failed in this House, when the plenary rejected as inadequate what had come out of the conciliation as having been agreed with the Council. It was clear to us that decisions concerning an enterprise’s continued existence could not be left to the shareholders alone, but that the people who were employed by it had, at the very outset, to be informed and enabled to influence events. After all, when an enterprise is taken over, it is not just power and a great deal of money that are at stake, but also the fate of many people. Issues of the enterprise’s location and the security of jobs are also involved. That is why the people affected must be asked their opinion and involved in what happens.</p>
<p class="contents">Today sees us making a new start on the takeover directive, and the rapporteur would like us to be able to manage with just one reading. At an early stage, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have promised him our support, albeit subject to the condition that a satisfactory solution must be found to the issue of workers’ rights. He has promised that it will be, but I – like everyone else who thought there would be a good solution – am surprised to find a takeover directive that is not one whit better than the first one. Faced with such an impertinence, we will not be waving this directive through into a fast-track procedure until the workers’ rights issue has been sorted out in a manner favourable to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This could have been an important directive for creating better preconditions for growth and for promoting restructuring within Europe’s corporate structure. It is the dynamic companies that can be restructured that create jobs. Without jobs, Europe will not survive. That is genuinely an issue in the employees’ interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The expression ‘Much ado about nothing’ is quite a good description of this controversial directive. For fourteen years, we have tried to bring about these fair and common ground rules. In fact, we have failed, but it is nonetheless a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally have had some difficulty with this debate. In principle, my view is that the differentiated voting right does not favour the emergence of efficient companies able to compete in a global market. Over time, the various voting values tend to consolidate deficient corporate structures. I also think there are important legal objections to retroactive legislation, and I can also see the point of entrepreneurs being able to go to the stock exchange to obtain extra capital for their life’s work without losing complete control of it. In spite of this, it is incredibly important for us to obtain common corporate ground rules with a view to opening the European market to more liberal restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, be able to live with this compromise. We could have obtained more, and more is what we wanted. Now, this directive is more about openness and the protection of minority shareholders, and less about takeover rules. It is, however, a step in the right direction, and I think we can support this compromise, even if it shows that it takes sixteen years for EU legislation to come into effect. An initial 14 years and then a further two years before it is incorporated. If we continue in this pattern, we shall never become dynamic and competitive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unacceptably, no such guarantees are given.

<p class="contents">Although we have known this for a while, it has just dawned on me that Mr Bolkestein is rejecting the defensive mechanisms that are now being proposed in the amendments and that are more or less optional in each country, resulting in the creation, as he intended, of a very watered-down version of the directive. This also has some advantages for employees, for it means that, in some cases, these mechanisms will still give employees and employers themselves control over a few rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of that, I am in any case pleased that the new directive now contains what we have decided on in the meantime, namely new guidelines on information and consultation in a number of cases, for which praise is due, for that was one of the stumbling blocks last time. I should, however, like to add that we would actually want pro-active action to be taken in takeover bids that do not succeed – which is in about 50% of the cases. This means that consultation must precede the bid, that consultation about this bid must take place before it is made public, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein, it is a matter of modern management, a matter of socially responsible management, that consultation should be further detailed in such a way as to entitle stakeholders, and not only shareholders, to consultation where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled those amendments to improve matters. Although my group is divided on this, I think that the majority are behind our position. We would like those amendments to be adopted; if they are not, we want to vote against the proposal. The majority of the group are behind me on this. It has been said that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. They can stay in the bush as far as I am concerned, and another way could then be found to make consultation more detailed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council did not want to see the withdrawal of Member States’ means for intervening in the case of attempted hostile takeover bids for their large national companies. For twenty years, Europe has indeed been systematically destroying the strategic actors that are the Nation States, and what is more without managing to replace them.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive proposes to protect the interests of minority shareholders and to keep employees informed. In fact, it lifts the obstacles to our companies being taken over by interests outside Europe, to the extent that, in Article 6 for example, it designates a single supervisory authority and prohibits authorities in Member States from giving their approval or demanding the addition of supplementary information. Furthermore, this directive does not say anything at all about the specific control that the European Commission exercises over mergers that are likely to lead to misuse of a dominant position, control which, strangely enough, is still opposed to this type of merger when a European company has the dominant position, but much less so when a company from outside Europe has this position.

Virtuous circulation means more productivity, more growth, more competitiveness and - I am addressing the left-wing Members here - more employment. After 14 years, we have, at last, reached our goal and it is a pity that the Commission is not taking up the positive aspects of the present compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, there has been intense cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament, and that is a positive result in itself. Europe certainly needs positive results right now! This is, of course, a compromise, the only compromise possible at the present time. We would have liked more, especially my country, whose legislation on the matter is very advanced and open; we would have liked a directive creating a genuinely level playing field with the passivity rule and the total neutralisation of defensive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We tried, but it was not possible because of the opposition of certain Member States which are now probably hiding behind so-called social amendments. The compromise to be put to the vote tomorrow reflects the state of European capitalism, which is still a mixture of small-scale and large-scale capitalism. However, it does provide proper protection of workers’ rights. Hence the opt-in/opt-out system as regards the level playing field. However, the undertaking is given to try again in a few years, with the useful sunset clause, when the time will be ripe because the financial markets will have favoured the companies which opt to be competitive. All we will have to do then is delete Article 11 A, make a few cosmetic adjustments, and we will have a new directive ready for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With this directive and the others which we are adopting in the framework of the Financial Services Action Plan, competitive companies, their governance and their balance sheets will be transparent. We have a great need of transparency, in view of recent cases such as the <span class="italic">Enron</span>, <span class="italic">Cirio</span> and <span class="italic">Parmalat</span> cases. Companies will be encouraged to opt to be competitive by the fact that competitive companies will be able to refuse to be taken over by non-competitive companies. We have established the benchmark and we have protected it, which is better than a directive merely laying down transparency procedures such as that which exists in the United States. All in all, we can be proud of what we have achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of this, the compromise now before us is, in my view, unacceptable. The proposal would mean that vote differentiation in the matter of shares could be permitted to remain for a transitional period, as an exception to the general rule. Subsequently, a revision would take place, involving a review of the system of A and B shares and also of other forms of shareholding.</p>
<p class="contents">Many believe that this has rescued the Nordic system of shares with different voting values. Those who maintain that this is a good compromise fail, however, to appreciate the issue of principle surrounding whether the EU is entitled to interfere in how shareholders in private companies choose to organise themselves. I find it regrettable to see so many in this Parliament so casually accepting infringements of the right of ownership. No one mentions the crucial issue of the principle of respect for the right of ownership. It is the business of no one other than the shareholders themselves how they organise their shares. That is a basic prerequisite of the market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">If the compromise is approved, this means in practice that Parliament says it is acceptable to appropriate assets. If someone has bought a share with a higher voting value at market price, what right does the EU or any state then have quite simply to rob this person of this investment by saying that what he has paid for no longer has any value?</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Government maintains that this revision clause is a victory because the revision is to embrace more forms of shareholding than simply the system of shares with different voting values. That may be the case, but the Swedish Government no doubt knows as well as anyone else that, in five years’ time when the revision takes place, no one will either be able, or wish, to investigate the multiplicity of forms of shareholding that exist within the EU. Presumably, the discussion would, then too, be focused upon the system of A and B shares. The reason for that is simple. Different voting values are a clear and straightforward system. Unlike with most other systems of shareholding, it is very simple to see how many votes a type of share corresponds to, and it is at least as easy to see what the share is worth in the market. There are no pitfalls or secrets in this system.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the new regulations governing takeover bids is that the EU should be an open market and that obstacles to takeovers should be removed. The fact is, however, that the number of takeovers in countries in which different voting values are applied is not in any way lower than the number in countries where this system is not permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the proposal now before us is, in my opinion, unacceptable, for, in the first place, it infringes the right of ownership; secondly, does not respect agreements entered into; and, thirdly, identifies vote-differentiated shares as an obstacle to takeovers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, firstly I would like to refer to certain amendments. As I said earlier this evening I cannot accept Amendments Nos 5 or 21 because they introduce the optional arrangements which the Commission rejects.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have some difficulties with Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 20, last paragraph, concerning special rights, which mix in an undesirable way special rights provided for in the articles of association of certain companies which could be exempted from the application of Article 11, and special rights provided for in law which, as I said earlier, are not within the scope of this directive in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said tonight on this subject but only two questions have been addressed to the Commission. The first question is about the inclusion of consultation and codetermination rights for employees and I would like to say in answer to that question that this is not a social directive. It would therefore not be appropriate to introduce through this directive new consultation and codetermination rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Following Parliament's request, we have included in our new proposal a new Article 13 which makes it quite clear that all existing information, consultation and, where appropriate, codetermination rights which are part of Community law, also apply here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also stated very clearly that Member States are free to introduce rights that go beyond Community law as long as they respect the rules concerning insider trading. Furthermore, following Parliament's request, we have now stated in Article 8 of the directive that all information concerning the offer should be made available to the representatives of the employees or to the employees of both the offeree company and the offeror.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question was addressed to the Commission by Lord Inglewood. He asked whether any more measures may be proposed by the Commission. Of course the Commission will review on a regular basis what is happening in this area, in particular how the market will react to this proposal if it is accepted, but the moment for reviewing the situation and revising the proposal is five years after its adoption. If one takes into account the normal period for adoption that date will then be in 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also a reason why the Commission is profoundly unhappy with the proposal as it now seems to be approved by Parliament, because the world is going to change a great deal between now and 2011 and, as I said earlier, this will only be reviewed in 2011. That is a long way off.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Lord Inglewood in his assessment of this proposal.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
