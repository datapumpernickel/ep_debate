<p class="contents">What, then, is that constitution worth? There is no freedom of association for political parties. The Green Party, which submitted its articles of association several months ago, has still not been recognised and has not even received an acknowledgement that its application has been received. These anti-democratic manoeuvres are taking place on the eve of the legislative and local elections planned for October. We have no guarantee regarding these elections, because there is no independent electoral commission. In our opinion, the release of Chbih Melainine is a prerequisite for holding the elections in October, as is the reconstitution of all the opposition parties. It is in order to allow all these political actors to participate that we are asking that the elections should be postponed. In order to re-establish democracy and guarantee the organisation of free and fair elections in Mauritania, we are asking the Council and the Commission to enter into consultations with the government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political opponents of the regime are being neutralised. People are being arbitrarily arrested, excessive force is being used against peaceful demonstrators and the press now serves only as the president’s lackey. The judiciary is again entirely at the disposal of those with political power. Their Honours recently sentenced the principal political opponents of the president in a show trial to no less than five years in prison. The imprisoned politicians were kept <span class="italic">incommunicado </span>for a long period and then taken to prison 800 km from the capital, so that they can receive almost no visitors. It appears that no one can do anything to stop this. Independent human rights organisations can scarcely operate in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">While Western countries are obliged to apologise in Durban for the slave trade conducted by their distant ancestors, slavery is still common practice in Mauritania. In the caste system, people become serfs at birth. They receive no education; no income from forced labour and are not allowed to marry without the permission of their master. According to an estimate by the American State Department a few years ago, there are still some 90 000 slaves in Mauritania. As recently as 1983, this country was the last on earth to abolish slavery officially, but still does its utmost to keep the gruesome reality hidden from the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that the European Union opened the consultative procedure of Article 96 with Mauritania. We cannot continue giving aid and maintaining intensive trade relations as if there were no problem. We must prepare for pseudo-elections in a pseudo-democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water is a scarce resource and its 2.2 million people are poor and live in rural areas. It depends on its exports of iron ore and fishing – just two things. I was invited in May of this year to lead a small delegation of MEPs and visit Mauritania, which I did. I spent a week with parliamentarians, all the ministers, President Taya, civil society and NGOs. We travelled up and down the country – a week is a long time to be in Mauritania. Mrs Sudre and Mrs Langenhagen came with me. I was impressed by what President Taya has done over the years in a country as poor as this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am astonished – and I want to embarrass him and his government, which I shall do at the ACP Conference when their delegates come – that there is now this sad case of locking up the opposition. There is no reason for it, there is no need. He is quite strong, he is quite popular. He has done well. He can do well without locking up his opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as slavery is concerned, it is actually banned in Islam and Mauritania is a Muslim country. There are Moors, there are blacks and various mixtures of these two. I saw their lifestyle. I did not see any slaves, though that is not to say they are not there. What I shall certainly do is embarrass the government of Mauritania at the ACP Conference to make sure this practice does not continue and the opposition is allowed to operate freely so that there is accountability of the ministers. It is better for the president of the country and the people of the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are talking about a country that falls within the ACP framework in relation to the European Union and which, furthermore, hopes to move on from its current observer status to becoming a full member of the Barcelona process. We are obliged to remind the Mauritanian authorities that it is impossible for the European Union to envisage, for example, that country acquiring full member status in the Barcelona process if democracy does not become a reality, if human rights continue to be violated and, what is more, if the date is maintained for the municipal and legislative elections which, as things stand at the moment, will take place this October without any type of guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly little chance of dissolved parties and imprisoned opposition leaders being able to participate when, furthermore, they have nowhere to express themselves because the press is either overseen by the government or simply does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I shudder to think about the situation of that one Member of Parliament who does not belong to the government party in an assembly of 79 seats, but I imagine that if any opposition Member were elected in these elections – which will not happen – he would probably soon be sent from Parliament to jail.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the European Union must implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. Mauritania lowers the already low average level of democracy and human rights in the Maghreb. However, it is clearly just one more case on a continent such as Africa, where human rights are constantly violated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mauritania is a country where the permanent dictator, not the dictator of the moment, President Mauya Uld Sid'Ahmed Taya, has just torn up all the rules which, with the mediation of the European Union, the opposition and the government had established for proper elections, elections furthermore which have been delayed indefinitely. I believe that the Union must act decisively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, although some good souls have assured us that everything is working out nicely, Togo is still living in a political wasteland and it has a long way to go before it escapes from it. Democracy is still a fleeting ideal. Civil rights and human rights are constantly flouted, and I believe that the passive attitude of the governments of European Union Member States does nothing to encourage things to change. Parliament’s regular condemnations are merely rhetorical and ineffective. Most recently, the sum paid by the Commission to organise new elections – CFA francs 4 billion – was dismissed as insufficient by the government, which took advantage of the opportunity to postpone, yet again, the long-awaited legislative elections. In a complete violation of his previous undertakings, President Eyadema and his government are even thinking about amending the constitution so as to allow him stand for election again. Finally, one of the opposition leaders, Mr Yawovi Agboyibo, was arrested and sentenced, a month ago, on trumped-up charges. The truth of the matter is that he had denounced the terror tactics employed in areas where the opposition had a majority, tactics which took the form of rapes and other crimes, including the murder of opponents. Mr Eyadema seems less than ever prepared to honour his obligations to his people and his obligations to the international community. Here again, Parliament should firmly condemn his actions, demand that free elections be held on the planned dates, and ask the Council and the Commission to initiate consultations in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Opposition parties are banned or it is made impossible for them to function. Opponents who have or threaten to acquire support are put behind bars. The press is completely manipulated and anyone openly criticising the president winds up in a cell if he is lucky and six feet under if he is less fortunate. Mass demonstrations are mercilessly broken up. The political class consists entirely of slavish servants of the president as a result of a system of rewards and punishments. A ludicrous cult of personality is designed to give the Head of State a quasi-divine status. The French President, Mr Chirac, has to be hoodwinked to such an extent that he condemns Amnesty International instead of the human rights violations in Togo. The murdering of opponents of the regime goes unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">This is still unfortunately the familiar pattern in many African countries and we do not really know how to deal with it. Crude misuse of power hampers development and perpetuates poverty. The European Union quite rightly suspended aid as long ago as 1993, but the situation has not improved. On the contrary, the opposition leader and human rights campaigner, Mr Agboyibo, was thrown into jail for six months, for allegedly insulting the Prime Minister. In order to add force to his arguments his Excellency maintains a private army of 1 000 troops.</p>
<p class="contents">Togo is asking for financial support to hold parliamentary elections in October. The question is whether or not we would then contribute to the organisation of a democratic farce, designed solely to give those in power a semblance of legitimacy. President Eyadema has announced that he will keep to the constitution and step down in 2003, but why should we believe someone who has lied for 34 years in order to stay in power? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some leaders are indeed proving exceptionally creative in eliminating their political opponents and getting round the democratic rules of the game. One of them is General Eyadema from Togo.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last elections in 1998 he did not hesitate to have the counting of votes stopped and himself again proclaimed president. A period of bloody repression followed, in which, according to Amnesty, hundreds of people were killed. An international committee confirmed those findings, but at the present moment, no one has yet been called to account or punished. On the contrary, the repression is simply continuing. The latest victim is opposition leader, Mr Agboyibo. Last month in a show trial, he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for spreading false information. I have met Yawovi Agboyibo several times personally in his home base. I have developed a very great admiration for the way in which, at the constant risk of his own life, he continues to campaign for human rights and the restoration of democracy in his country.</p>
<p class="contents">This must be stopped in some way. Maintaining the suspension of aid is one thing, but I believe that we must ask ourselves whether a country like Togo still belongs at conferences of the ACS and the European Union. However, the problem is that, just as in the case of Zimbabwe, certain European states follow their own agenda for the sake of commercial or other interests and, in so doing, run counter to the European strategy towards Togo. It is not enough to establish fine principles in an agreement. They must also be applied consistently and that also applies to a country like France. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much support is still required on the slow road to democracy, and the local elections will be an extremely important moment in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kampuchean People’s Party, which controls the country, is an old-style Communist party, which means that it as a party is directly or indirectly involved in everything, in every sector, at every level in that country. Consequently, it is not surprising that the local elections should be considered a threat and that they have been repeatedly postponed. It is therefore essential that we continue to exert international pressure on the government to do everything possible to create a violence-free period before the elections and to reopen the procedure for voter registration. Voter registration is in the hands of the village headmen, who are appointed by the central committee of the Kampuchean People’s Party, and nothing is simpler than to give poll cards to those in favour of the government and withhold them from those opposed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last Monday, the leader of the opposition, the Member of Parliament, Sam Rainsy, had a meeting with the local representative of the European Commission, who in that conversation, was able to make the point that we have a very positive attitude to the National Election Committee. I am far from being so enthusiastic. We must watch that National Election Committee very closely, since it is at the crux of whether or not the elections are being conducted fairly. The European Union has little cause to be proud of the way in which we observed the elections in Kampuchea last time, and we must do a lot better this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During this period, there were two people who personified the hope for freedom, Son San, the important democrat, who often visited us here in Strasbourg and who has since died, and King Sihanouk, who is now an old, ill man. That is why this country needs to be renewed from the roots upwards and young, democratic forces need to be supported. This can only be done through the communes, it can only be done through democratic local elections from the roots upwards. That is why it is so important for us to support and back the numerous candidates in the communes, for us to ensure that fair local elections are held, for us to monitor efficiently, for us to ward off, prevent and correct any jiggery-pokery during registration. As for the Criminal Tribunal, we must state quite clearly that this is not a question of revenge, it is a question of law. We must state quite clearly to future offenders that acts of violence, genocide and mass murder will be ruthlessly punished on the basis of the rule of law, irrespective of who is responsible.

Not only did he rescue the people from a sinking ship, but subsequently too he consistently took the side of the people. It is thanks to such humanitarian help that we can retain a vague hope in a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, our group feels that a legal obligation should be introduced to allow the stowaways ashore at the first port of call, in agreement with the 1957 Treaty on stowaways. As a result of the clash between the various spheres of law, the refugees become the exhausted pawns in a game of passing the buck.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it must be clearly stated that Australia’s actions in this matter have been far from praiseworthy. Local political interests have taken precedence over the respecting of human rights. Through its actions, Australia supports and finances the source of the problems with which the country is confronted. Too little attention is paid to the cause. The main responsibility for this drama lies with the Taliban regime, which is systematically destroying its own country and killing the spirit of its own population, so that migrations of people have become a necessary evil.</p>
<p class="contents">In this matter, we have an international political humanitarian responsibility. We might have wished that Australia would use its political weight to condemn the regime in Afghanistan and to spur the international community on to constructive action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only because of the repressive and fanatical nature of a regime which denies women and children education, work and even medical care, but also because of the deterioration of the economic situation which that fanatical regime is causing in the country. We therefore perfectly understand the almost 500 people which tried to flee, at risk of their lives, and came up against a brick wall erected by a country such as Australia, a rich country which could have taken them in from the outset without any problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should acknowledge the courage of the captain of the Norwegian freighter, Arne Rinnan, who, without thinking of the consequences and led only by humanitarian considerations, immediately picked up these people, who were in danger of drowning. In contrast, we must strongly criticise a country which, like any of our countries, is obliged to take in a ship which was sailing in it waters with almost 500 people in a situation as precarious as that of these refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules must be laid down to prevent this type of situation. I know that it is not easy, that there are increasing numbers of refugees, that poverty is spreading and is the reason why many people are seeking a better life, but I believe that the attitude of Australia must not be imitated by any country towards any group of refugees who, under the protection of the United Nations Convention of 1951, are asking to be allowed to survive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, a former European Commissioner and Member of this Parliament, the current Greek Minister for the Merchant Navy, Christos Papoutzis, has highlighted the irresponsibility of the Turkish government in allowing a situation such as this to come about.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Member who has just spoken has said, we are undergoing a universal process of globalisation. The phenomenon of illegal immigration is not confined to one part of the world. The European Union, to be specific, is currently seeing the arrival of huge numbers of immigrants, and since Commissioner Lamy is here, and he has been so concerned with the problems of globalisation, I would like to say that I believe we are dealing with another aspect of the phenomenon of that globalisation. Just as capital and goods are being moved about freely, it seems that people also want to move about freely.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs González Álvarez has said, this is not an issue which is easily resolved, but I believe we could do something from here on many levels. On the most general level there would be a regulation of the international economy that includes population movements. And on more specific levels it would mean action by the institutions of the European Union to try to regulate this illegal immigration. This very week, this summer, on the island where I live, we have seen the bodies of illegal immigrants who have been flung from the boats on which they were arriving by Moroccan skippers who form genuine mafias.</p>
<p class="contents">The question should be put to the Commission of what measures the European Union is preparing for action within its own territory and what measures it is proposing on an international level. I believe that we must act in our own territory, and in the area of neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Morocco, which are sending us illegal immigrants, and on an international level, by establishing regulations of a general nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that responsibility on the issue of the Afghan refugees should fall exclusively to Australia. Responsibility also falls, for example, to the Indonesian government because it was from there that the original boat sailed, the crew was Indonesian, it all began in waters under Indonesian jurisdiction and it seems that nobody is remembering to state this type of responsibility at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that international action is required in this case and I believe that this would be an excellent opportunity for the European Commission to implement an initiative, I repeat, not only in the closer area of our neighbours, but also on an international level, with a view to achieving the regulation of migratory flows and illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The captain was given permission to proceed to the Indonesian port of Merak, after which he was put under duress by the passengers with threatened suicides and forced to sail towards Australian waters. It is believed that many of these passengers set out from a refugee camp in Pakistan, paying about GBP 4 500 each to be taken illegally to Australia. Apparently the going rate for Germany is GBP 7 000 and Britain, the destiny of choice, is GBP 10 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Australian government was perfectly entitled to exercise its sovereign right under the law of the sea to secure its borders by refusing the ship access to Australian waters. Nor do its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention apply until an asylum seeker is actually present on its territory. The convention itself, introduced before the age of cheap mass jet travel, was a response to the horrors of Nazism and designed to protect the principle of asylum. However, as we are all aware, it is increasingly abused by economic migrants who pass through several safe but poor countries in order to reach rich countries to settle in, where it can lead to people-trafficking, prostitution and a black economy in jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In Britain over 100 000 people claimed asylum last year and the great majority of these claims were unfounded. But it remains profitable for criminal people-traffickers to ply their trade because appeals can be strung out for years and, even when unsuccessful, almost no-one is deported back to their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Australia's problem is also our problem. We need urgently to face up to the need to secure our borders and remove those who enter illegally. There is widespread concern. The EU should urgently develop new policies in this area. We also need to exert severe pressure on those countries which refuse to take back their own nationals. In fact we need to totally renegotiate the 1951 Geneva Convention and think again.</p>

I would like to distance myself from statements like that. It misrepresents the position of people in Britain who do not understand the kind of attitude that we heard here earlier this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad that after eight days of sitting under tarpaulins in the hot sun and inside containers, the Afghan refugees are now at least in reasonable conditions on board the ship on a long voyage to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. It has been an extremely tragic incident and terrible to watch and to think of their suffering. But more than anything it teaches us that the 50-year old asylum-seeking system instigated by the United Nations is not working any more. It is creaking under the strain of the mass movement of 21 million migrants a year. The desperation of the people on the <span class="italic">Tampa </span>is clear. To suggest that people take this kind of action lightly is ridiculous. They take terrible risks with their lives and the lives of their children in order to escape persecution or penury. They cross the seas in inflatable boats, they cling to the underside of trains like the Eurostar and jumbo jets. The suffering of the refugees on the <span class="italic">Tampa </span>should at least lead all the governments that we represent here to rethink the way that they implement the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that the first thing we have to try and do is to ensure that it is governments, rather than organised criminals, that determine where refugees finally end up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Once again, it was UNITA which struck the blow, thereby continuing to violate the peace agreement signed in Lusaka in 1994, which made provision, amongst other things, for the disarming of the militant rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, these acts of terrorism are merely one further stage in the civil war that has been ravaging the country for more than 25 years. Above all, however, these extremely violent acts against civilians only serve to postpone even further the prospect of organising the elections planned by the government for 2002–2003.</p>
<p class="contents">When he announced, on 23 August, his intention not to stand in the presidential elections, President dos Santos threw the ball back into the rebels’ court. He says that he is prepared to hold free and democratic elections, provided that the war comes to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The pause in the fighting and the restoration of a peaceful climate are due, according to him, to Mr Savimbi and his militant movement. Yet Mr Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, says that he wants to negotiate. In reality, of course, sitting comfortably on his diamonds, he wants only one thing: all the power.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also responsible here, because who is it who supplies UNITA with arms? Who is it who participates in this diamond trafficking? As for the government, it is not transparent either. The lack of transparency in the management of petroleum revenue leads us to conclude that public funds have been used to back up the regime. The Angolagate scandal has revealed the role of Europeans in this affair.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence has to stop, and dialogue must be initiated as a matter of urgency. Angolans must vote for and achieve peace. The European Union can make its influence felt, and it has a role to play here. It should be reminded of that fact, and we must vote in favour of this resolution in order to go forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one has yet claimed responsibility for this attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous to this, there had been the attack on the train we are condemning today, which caused the deaths of more than two hundred people and for which UNITA claimed responsibility. Lives have been wasted and innocent blood has been spilled in a bout of violence that we can only condemn. We condemn UNITA today with the same independence with which, in February, we condemned the MPLA and the Angolan government for persecuting journalists. More important, however, than condemning those who stubbornly continue to wage war, and criticising both sides, which undoubtedly deserve our criticism for pursuing this path of confrontation, the most important and most useful thing may be to foster peace.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament can contribute to encouraging all those in Angola tired of war and wanting a better future. Along with many other Members of this House, specifically Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I signed a proposal to award the Sakharov prize to Zacarias Kamuenho, Archbishop of Huambo and Chairman of the Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé.

<p class="contents">We have watched these terrible events unfold in Angola with profound and heartfelt regret. The suffering of the Angolans and of these innocent civilian victims of the attack by UNITA or of other events gives us no satisfaction. We do not see these occurrences as a triumph that should feed the warlike approach of the government and prolong the war. We must remember the tragedy that Angola has experienced for the last twenty-six years, in a never-ending violent bipolarisation of the country, of which the Angolan people are weary. </p>
<p class="contents">This phase of the civil war, we must remember, is the third wave of the war, and each wave has been more brutal than the last. It is clearly the consequence of UNITA’s failing to meet its commitments, but it is also the consequence of President dos Santos’s plan, announced in December 1998, to use weapons to destroy his old enemy.</p>
<p class="contents">This could only lead to disaster and, once again, it is a disaster that we are witnessing.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I should like to read from the account of a missionary who returned from Angola a few months ago: “In 2000, Angola celebrated 25 years of independence. In 2001 it ‘commemorated’ 40 years of war. There are now three generations of Angolans for whom living in wartime is all that they know. I lived in Cuíto and Huambo between 1989 and 1994. I saw boundless hope etched on the faces of many Angolans, who were crushed by commitments that had never been met. Now, when it is clear that there is no military solution to the conflict, – not that there ever was! – people are saying more than ever that arms are the key to peace. Whilst this is being said and put into practice, young people are abandoning their studies, adults are not working and children are not going to school, hospitals are without medicines and this armed route will not lead Angola to any kind of future”. Serious incidents are occurring, such as those that we are condemning today. The missionary goes on to say: “I cannot, however, accept such a conclusion about a country that is so rich in natural and, above all, in human resources.”</p>
<p class="contents">This priest, Father Tony Neves, who has a profound knowledge of Angola, finishes with a dream of peace, but warns us that “25 years after independence, Angola has only two options: peace or total destruction”.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what must make us aware of our responsibilities. We cannot work with the warlords, whether they are involved in diamonds or oil. We can only rely on those who are fighting for peace without weapons in their hands, those who, inspired by the churches, by Archbishop Kamuenho, by the Interdenominational Committee for Peace, are rising up in civil society. We can only rely on those on the moderate wings of UNITA and the MPLA, such as the former prime ministers Marcolino Môco and Lôpo de Nascimento, such as certain journalists of whom we sometimes hear because of the persecution to which they are subjected, such as certain moderate UNITA Members of Parliament like Chivukuvuku Jaka Jamba, many moderate people in the MPLA and, above all, other small parties in the Angolan Parliament, whose voices are never heard. Why do we never hear these people, such as Filomeno Vieira Lopes and Mfulopinda Nando Vítor, who have never taken up arms?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the people we should listen to, because Angola does not only consist of the dos Santoses and the Savimbis. Angola belongs to the Angolan people, and we must listen to the spokespeople of those who are suffering and not always the spokespeople who are doing the killing.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidature of Archbishop Zacarias Kamuenho is part of this approach and I urge all honourable Members to ensure that we, as an international community, understand the tragedy of the Angolan people. The cold war is long since past and it is high time that the international community stopped pouring oil on the flames of Angola and contributed responsibly to peace, to dialogue and to a bilateral, simultaneous and immediate cease-fire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miranda (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the appalling terrorist attacks that Mr Savimbi’s UNITA has been carrying out in Angola, first in Caxito, then on a train, and then on cars, schools and hospitals, warrant our sternest condemnation, because they mainly affect the civilian population. These are some of the most violent and reprehensible terrorist acts in living memory. I therefore feel that the European Parliament too must express its repudiation of such acts in the most forceful terms, as the rest of the international community and, in particular, the other Community institutions have done by unequivocally condemning such barbarity.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, and if any doubts could possibly remain, these acts have brutally shown the correct nature of the positions that have been successively adopted by the international community which, with a single voice, has called for and is implementing the isolation of UNITA and the imposition of sanctions on it. That organisation had already given sufficient proof of being largely responsible for the tragic situation affecting Angola and its people, through its rejection of election results, obstructing the disarming of its forces and, more generally, through waging war and not respecting and even blocking the implementation of agreements that they themselves have signed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, with such acts of vandalism, UNITA is revealing its true colours even more clearly and there is no longer room for any doubt, however small, as to the nature and the objectives of this organisation. This is why there are even fewer grounds for holding equivocal positions, particularly where the European Parliament is concerned. Any positions or initiatives, particularly when formulated by friends of UNITA such as Mr Ribeiro and Castro, which tend to condone, exonerate or divert attention from the huge responsibilities of UNITA in the tragic situation that Angola is experiencing are completely unacceptable. This applies also, and especially, to those that tend to place the legitimate government of Angola on an equal footing with this type of terrorist organisation. As a matter of fact, it is now clearer than ever that any path to peace in Angola requires holding UNITA responsible, ensuring its political and diplomatic isolation, ending the diamond trade that sustains it and disarming it for good.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I should just like to say a few words about the motion for a resolution that we shall be voting on next. Its approval, despite the odd provision that is not worthy of adoption and is not essential, would be a positive development in that it would enable the European Parliament to adopt its traditional position of aligning itself with the international community and with the other Community institutions on this matter. In particular, I would like to emphasise the correctness of the decision adopted by the resolution to call the acts that UNITA has recently been perpetrating ‘terrorist’ acts. This is the right word to describe them and all concomitant conclusions should be drawn from that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not do favours for the diamond dealers or the oilmen or for Angola’s corrupt administration, which is largely responsible for what is happening and for the suffering of the Angolan people. Mr Miranda should be ashamed of what he says and what he does, particularly because he is chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and should be making a more responsible contribution to promoting a cease-fire and dialogue, which is what the Angolan people are asking us to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, allow me to take up the various points which have been mentioned during this debate, and to let you know the Commission’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Mauritania, first of all, we share the concerns that have been expressed regarding respect for human rights in Mauritania. In recent years we have observed some progress. This has now come to an end, and we are experiencing a period of sudden backward steps. Like the Members who have spoken during the debate, we believe that the Union cannot remain silent in the face of the imprisonment of the leader of the opposition, Mr Chbih, in the conditions that we are aware of and in particular in the period leading up to the elections. Therefore we, like you, believe that steps should be taken to ask for the release of Mr Chbih while the result of his appeal to the court of cassation is awaited, at the same time using this opportunity to remind the authorities of the principles to which the Union is committed with regard to the electoral process. The release of Mr Chbih and the holding of the elections this coming October are our two priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Togo, again we share your concern, both about the imprisonment of a local journalist in May and about the imprisonment of the two leaders of the opposition parties, Mr Olympio in June, and Mr Agboyibo just recently. All these names and all these facts have been mentioned, in particular by Mr Rod. We should like to follow up our approach to the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 August, when once again we expressed our concerns to the Togolese government. At the time, I believe that we got a clear message across, to the effect that, from the point of view of the Union, the political parties and the media must be able to continue their activities without restrictions. So far, our approach has not had any effect. We believe that the statement made in August by the Prime Minister, in which he mentioned the need to postpone the elections and proposed that the electoral code should be amended, which some Members have mentioned, is not good news and does not help to create a climate which is conducive to the conducting of transparent, free and democratic elections. On this subject we have noted with satisfaction the statement made by President Eyadema, in which he said that on this point the Prime Minister’s proposals committed only the Prime Minister himself, whereas he, the President, intended to respect the constitution and abide by the undertakings given under the Lomé Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We are continuing to monitor the political and economic situation and we shall maintain our position, to the effect that we can render assistance to the electoral process by helping the government to create the necessary conditions, notwithstanding the suspension of our cooperation with Togo which, as you know, was decided on under the provisions of the Lomé Convention, which corresponds to what would now be Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. From this point of view, Mr Rod, we are already past the Article 96 stage. The Union has also responded positively to the invitation from the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs to participate in a mission to observe the elections. If the United Nations decided to take on the task of coordinating such an observer mission, we would not have any objections. However, the conditions for organising and implementing such an observer mission still have to be determined. If it is decided to go ahead with such a mission, obviously Parliament’s participation in that mission would be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">As for human rights in Cambodia, the Commission and the Member States have been officially invited by Cambodia to nominate and dispatch observers to monitor the local elections. With this in mind, we have sent a fact-finding mission. The conclusions and recommendations of that mission will be examined by the Council during September, so as to decide whether or not we should organise a Community observer mission to monitor the local elections. We are also ready to assist in the smooth running of those elections by means of technical assistance projects. On the question of electoral registration, Mrs Maes, the latest figures available to us indicate that the overall rate of registration is just over 80%, which is an improvement on the previous figures, though 100% registration has still not been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the question of how we should deal with the past, which some of you have mentioned, I would remind you that we support without reservation the efforts of the United Nations and of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia to reach an agreement concerning the court responsible for the Khmer Rouge trials.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Afghan refugees seeking asylum in Australia, we, like Mrs Kinnock, are relieved that a solution has been found which will provide the help and protection needed by those people, men, women and children, who are fleeing from one of the most intolerant of all regimes. If I have understood you correctly, your speeches were not intended to put any particular third country in the dock, but rather to consider whether, in the context of the present system of international governance, there are any remedies that would enable us to handle this type of situation better.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, we cannot remain insensitive. We all know that there are other ships carrying other fugitives from misery, often in the most appalling conditions, and that these ships arrive, some of them off the coasts of Europe. This is not a question of ‘the rest of the world’, from which we can remain detached, any more it is a question of looking at it purely in the light of the problems that it may give rise to elsewhere. There is clearly a growing malaise in the international community with regard to forced migration, whether it is of economic, political or criminal origin, because this is how we must describe the organised networks trafficking in human beings. Mr Medina Ortega, we share the desire which you and other Members have expressed for international instruments to be adopted which will be able to prevent and settle such cases, and also your desire at least to update and amend the 1951 Convention so that it can cope with the present situation, which is not the same as it was in the 1950s. From this point of view, we support the efforts initiated by the High Commissioner for Refugees, which were announced on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of that Convention. The High Commissioner for Refugees played an important role in dealing with the crisis involving the <span class="italic">Tampa</span>, and I believe that we should all encourage the Commissioner to put this type of problem on the agenda of the consultations which, following the Geneva Conference in December, should enable us to update our rules, because that is what they are, international rules. We must also remember the importance of the protocols on trafficking in human beings which are annexed to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime of December 2000. The Community is itself a party to those protocols which, when they come into force, after a certain number of ratifications, will improve the joint framework that we have at our disposal in order to combat such crime.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Union itself is concerned, and we really <span class="italic">are </span>concerned, as I have said, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the Tampere European Council provided the basis for a common policy on asylum and immigration. I believe that the Union, by means of these instruments and various declarations, has repeated its commitment and that of its Member States to a humanitarian tradition which should take the form of the creation of a common asylum regime which provides appropriate protection to any person who needs it, and which guarantees the principle of not turning people away.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this will not work without preventive measures in the countries and regions of origin. We took a step in the right direction here when the Council adopted a certain number of action plans prepared by the immigration and asylum group. One of these plans is specifically targeted at Afghanistan and neighbouring regions. If it proves to be ineffective, we shall have to look at it again, and we shall rely on Parliament to point us in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trafficking in human beings is concerned, we need to strengthen the action taken by the Union, especially in cases where the victims are able to benefit from international protection. Here too, the Commission takes the view that a more systematic and coherent approach is needed. We shall shortly be taking action with a view to achieving this, by issuing a communication.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all turning into a timetable of action for the Union. Work has started within the Council. To be perfectly honest, we think that things are proceeding very slowly, but this is only to be expected given the sensitive nature of these issues from the point of view of Member States. No doubt we shall need fresh impetus at an appropriately high political level, probably at the European Council in Laeken. At any rate, that is what the Presidency seems to think. It goes without saying that Parliament’s support in this matter will, we are sure, enable us to proceed in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of the attack on a train in Angola, there is not much that I can add. Much of what has been said we can all agree on anyway. Like you, the Commission is very concerned about the continuation of this war, and deplores the fact that these confrontations are intensifying and that, yet again, several hundred civilians have been killed in various regions of the country over the last few weeks. We are absolutely determined to support the efforts being taken, in accordance with the Union’s common position, to find a political solution to the conflict in Angola. I did not get the impression, from your speeches, that you are seriously critical of that common position. We are therefore working towards implementing it, by supporting any proposal which seeks to support the initiatives being made by the African Union – and there <span class="italic">are</span> some – or by African regional organisations such as the Southern Africa Development Community, with a view to developing the systems which have been set up on the initiative of African countries in order to prevent and resolve conflicts. I would remind you that we are continuing our humanitarian aid to Angola, which is substantial, and that we are consequently ready to adjust the nature and the scale of that humanitarian aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What I said in my speech that gave Mr Ribeiro e Castro the pretext for answering in the way he did was simply that some friends of UNITA, specifically Mr Ribeiro e Castro, had gone ahead with certain initiatives. Mr President, I did not mean any insult by this, because it is public knowledge and widely known that this party, to which Mr Ribeiro e Castro belongs, has clear, public and acknowledged links with UNITA.
