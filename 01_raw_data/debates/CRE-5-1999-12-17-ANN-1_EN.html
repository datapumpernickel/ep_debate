<p>In its report A4-0066/99 on the Commission communication on the EU-India Enhanced Partnership, the European Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to make relations with India one of the EU's foreign policy priorities and 'to propose to the Indian Government the holding of an annual Euro-Indian Summit'. In October of this year the Commission (in the person of Mr Patten, Commissioner) expressed its determination to work towards establishing an EU-India strategic relationship. For a number of reasons - starting with the need to signal a complete break with the climate of relative indifference which has so far characterised EU-India relations and the urgent requirement for account to be taken of the extremely worrying developments taking place within the Chinese communist government and the consequent urgent need for India to be made the focal point of the EU's policy on Asia - the convening of an initial annual EU-India Summit could take on the utmost political significance.</p>
<p>Does the High Representative responsible for the CFSP share this view?</p>
<p>If so, could he indicate what action he has taken (or is intending to take) in order to ensure that the foundations of an EU-India strategic relationship are laid in the very near future?</p>
<p>In particular, is he prepared to do everything possible to enable an initial annual EU-India Summit to take place as early as next year?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council pays enormous attention to the on-going development of relations between the EU and India and actively works to achieve this by remaining in regular high level contact with our Indian partners. The EU is already India’s most important trade partner and its main source of aid in development cooperation. The last round of talks with leading Ministers and officials was held in Helsinki on 2 and 3 December 1999. During that round, many questions of interest and concern to both sides were discussed. These include the issue of cooperation in such areas as human rights, the environment, organised crime and terrorism, illicit drugs trafficking, dialogue on civil society, development trends in investment and trade, international issues such as security, a block on arms, the decommissioning of weapons, regional development in South Asia, and the views for the future that Europe and Asia share for the 21st century.</p>
<p>The next country to hold the Presidency, Portugal, has also made a proposal to hold a Summit meeting between the EU and India during their presidential term, and the General Affairs Council, which was held on 6 December, viewed the proposal positively. India has supported this proposal, and the Commission and the Secretariat are examining options with regard to the Indian Summit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0722"></a>

<p>Police harassment in the USA has increasingly come under the spotlight in recent years. The problem has been confirmed by bodies such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. As a result of police excesses, US citizen Ritt Goldstein in 1995 set up a citizens action group in Connecticut to set up external monitoring of the police by independent surveillance bodies. This made Goldstein himself the target of comprehensive police harassment, which forced him to leave the USA and apply for asylum in Sweden in the summer of 1997. His request was rejected in December 1998 as 'clearly without foundation'. The Swedish authorities did not question the severe harassment suffered by Goldstein but referred to the USA as 'an internationally recognised democracy in which the rule of law applied'. They also claimed that Goldstein had not been subject to State persecution as the perpetrators had been individual police officers. At the EU Summit in Tampere, the Council stated that EU refugee policy would be based on 'the full and inclusive application' of the Geneva Convention on Refugees, which should mean that all requests for asylum would be examined individually regardless of the country of origin and regardless whether the applicant had been subject to State or other persecution.</p>
<p>Does the Council consider that requests for asylum from US citizens may be rejected as 'clearly without foundation' without full examination of the individual case? Does it consider that 'unofficial' persecution does not entitle a person to refugee status under the Geneva Convention?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member will certainly know, ideas about what constitutes a ‘safe country of origin’ and applications for asylum that is ‘clearly without foundation’ have not been fully harmonised at Community level. Both phenomena are being discussed in association with the soft law approach in the Council resolution adopted in 1992 on applications for asylum that are clearly without foundation. Member States’ actions are guided in this area, however, by the rules laid down by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 1979 on the procedures and bases for determining refugee status and, in particular, the interpretation of Article 1, section A, paragraph 2 of the 1951 Convention.</p>
<p>This year in March the Commission communicated to the Council and the European Parliament its preparatory act on commonly agreed requirements for asylum-seeking procedures, which set forth ideas on future Community acts on what is meant by ‘clearly without foundation’ and ‘safe country of origin’.

<p>The Council is fully aware of the problem concerning the participation of women in the peace process (or their exclusion from it). In fact “Women and Armed Conflicts” is one of the concerns of the Beijing Action Platform adopted in 1995. Point 135 of the Beijing Action Platform recognises that “in a world of continuing instability and violence, the implementation of cooperative approaches to peace and security is urgently needed. The equal access and full participation of women in power structures and their full involvement in all efforts for the prevention and resolution of conflicts are essential for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Although women have begun to play an important role in conflict resolution, peace-keeping and defence and foreign affairs mechanisms, they are still underrepresented in decision-making positions. If women are to play an equal part in securing and maintaining peace, they must be empowered politically and economically and represented adequately at all levels of decision making.”</p>
<p>All Members of the United Nations are committed to the following: firstly, to promote equal opportunities and the equal involvement of women so that they are included in all fora and can participate in peace action at all levels and secondly, to take account of considerations of gender equality in the resolution of conflicts, armed or otherwise, and foreign occupation, and ensure that issues of gender equality can be discussed in various bodies.</p>
<p>Ministers who are responsible for equal opportunities raised the subject when they informally convened in Berlin on 14 and 15 June 1999. The Ministers stressed that the UNHCR’s guidelines on the protection of refugee women and the document drafted by the UN’s Interorganisational Standing Committee on mainstreaming gender in the humanitarian response to emergencies, should be applied and implemented forthwith, so that women’s needs might be taken into consideration in crisis situations and so that considerations of gender equality might be taken account of in all humanitarian action concerned with peace and reconstruction.</p>
<p>The Beijing plus five follow-up meeting, to be held next year, will be a good opportunity to evaluate progress and continue the work as appropriate.</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting by the ECE to review the implementation of the Peking action programme in 2000 (Geneva 19 –21 January 2000) will also be an opportunity for the Member States of the EU to be involved at European level in drafting recommendations regarding this issue for the Beijing plus five steering committee to consider. The question of women in military situations and conflicts is one of the subjects to be discussed at the ECE meeting. The Finnish Presidency is at present putting the final touches to the EU’s provisional comments on the final outcome of the meeting. The EU comments emphasise, among other things, the importance of strengthening the status of women as active participants in the prevention of conflicts, peacekeeping and constructive work.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0731"></a>

<p>President, I should like to give a joint answer to the questions by James Fitzsimons, Pat Gallagher and Richard Howitt, all of which refer to the revision of the Treaties.</p>
<p>President, I should first of all like to stress in reply to the questions by James Fitzsimons and Richard Howitt that the Council is fully aware of the importance both of the voluntary services and of certain NGOs in 'civil society'.</p>
<p>In this connection there is a need to stress the importance of voluntary work in the development of social solidarity in the European Union and in meeting those needs which cannot be satisfactorily met by any other means. Because the Treaty of Amsterdam established the importance of voluntary work in our society, the Council has striven by various means to take this special form of solidarity into account and to promote it within Europe, and proposes to give it a great deal of attention in the future as well. In this connection it is worth noting that the increased importance of many NGOs at a social level in Europe is equally essential.</p>
<p>As regards the forthcoming IGC, the Council can only urge the Honourable Members to study the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, paragraph 16 of which deals with the topics for discussion at the Conference which will begin in February 2000. At this stage the agenda for the Conference includes the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council, as well as related issues. The conclusions state that the next Presidency may propose additional issues to be included on the agenda of the Conference. According to its terms of reference, the Conference is to examine how the matter raised by the Honourable Member can be taken into account in the work of the Conference.</p>
<p>It may also be noted that the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council state that the European Parliament is closely involved and will take part in the work of the Conference. According to paragraph 18 of the conclusions, meetings of the preparatory Group for the Conference may be attended by two observers from the European Parliament. In addition, meetings at ministerial level will be preceded by an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament; similarly meetings at the level of Heads of State or Government dealing with the IGC will be preceded by an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Council also draws the Honourable Member's attention to the decision taken at the Tampere European Council (15-16 October 1999) that a body specially set up to deal with this matter, comprising representatives of the European Parliament, the Member States' governments, national parliaments and the Commission, be instructed to draw up a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union. The first meeting of this body will be held on 17 December and the Members of the European Parliament which is represented on it, will be regularly informed of the progress of negotiations.</p>
<p>In this forum, the European Parliament may bring up the efforts of individual people and organisations working in this area in the civil society to which I have referred.</p>
<p>Regarding the question by Pat Gallagher, the Council assures the Honourable Member that it fully supports the objectives of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and considers it essential to take all possible steps to safeguard children's rights by guaranteeing them appropriate protection against shameful forms of exploitation such as sexual abuse and forced labour, which should no longer occur in our day and age.</p>
<p>The Council also considers that civil society must guarantee without exception to all children the opportunity for education, for today's children are tomorrow's citizens.</p>
<p>I should like to draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that the Council does not take part in its capacity as a European Union body in the IGC, which is shortly to be convened to examine ways and means to review the Treaty.</p>
<p>That being so, I feel sure you will understand that the Council cannot reply in more detail to this question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0733"></a>

<p>The Tampere Council conclusions have made it clear that the protection of victims of crime is a priority for the future and has recommended that ‘national programmes should be set up to finance measures, public and non-governmental, for assistance to and protection of victims’.</p>
<p>Taking into account the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes, does the EU Council consider that compensation of EU nationals who fall victim to violent crimes while in another EU Member State should be subject to special measures at EU level, a situation which was not covered in the 1983 Convention and has the Council any time-scale in mind for ensuring the establishment of national programmes for the protection of victims of crime and, finally, will such programmes, which should envisage a special role for NGOs, be considered as an essential element in the enlargement process?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member reminds us in his question, the European Council held on 15 and 16 October 1999 in Tampere considered, on the basis of a communication from the Commission, that ‘minimum standards should be drawn up on the protection of the victims of crime, in particular on victims' access to justice and on their rights to compensation for damages, including legal costs. In addition, national programmes should be set up to finance measures, public and non-governmental, for assistance to and protection of victims’.</p>
<p>The Commission communication referred to in the question was forwarded to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member may note that in that communication, inter alia, the Member States were called upon to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes concluded on 24 November 1983, which has a more restricted scope.</p>
<p>The purpose of that Convention, which has to date been signed and ratified by eight European Union Member States, is to bind the parties to define in their legislation or administrative provisions a compensation system whereby compensation can be paid from public funds to those victims of violent crimes who have died or received serious physical injuries as a result of acts of violence.</p>
<p>The Commission is following up its communication and will shortly be presenting a table of results of the follow-up to the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. On the basis of the Commission communication the Member States are currently looking at the drafting of national programmes to assist and protect the victims of crime. However, the Council notes that it has not itself dealt with the proposals contained in the communication. All areas relating to justice and home affairs, including the status of victims, will be taken into account in the enlargement process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0737"></a>

Furthermore, the technical specifications in Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98 on euro coins of 3 May 1998 take account of the fact that these coins must be easily recognisable by means of appropriate visual and tactile features.

<p>The conclusions adopted in the General Affairs Council on 15 November stated that the Council had noted the current situation relating to the discussion of the initiative on the death penalty, as proposed by the EU in the UN General Assembly (motion for a resolution UNGA 54). It once again drew attention to the importance the initiative had as part of the EU’s overall policy on the abolition of the death penalty, and considered it was important to maintain EU unity in the forthcoming talks in New York.</p>
<p>After the EU successfully moved for a resolution on the abolition of the death penalty in the 55<span class="sup">th</span> sitting of the UN Human Rights Commission, it also decided for the first time to move for a draft resolution in the Third Committee of the 54<span class="sup">th</span> General Assembly of the UN. Many countries strongly opposed the initiative, however. The EU and the other countries that supported the initiative had no other choice than to postpone the introduction of the draft resolution on the death penalty, until more favourable circumstances offered themselves. If the initiative were to be discussed now there would be many changes to the text of the draft, as proposed by those counties that are in favour of keeping the death penalty. One of these proposed changes was particularly harmful to the content of the resolution and the whole initiative itself, as it set out to include in the initiative the principle of sovereignty, and the regard for human rights would be subordinate to a ban on interfering in the internal affairs of the country. </p>

<p>Reports coming out of Colombia are giving increasing cause for concern. Since 10 November tens of thousands of rural workers and native Indians have been demonstrating peacefully in Cauca, in the south of the country, and have been calling on the Colombian Government to honour the commitments it entered into with them following an earlier demonstration. The police sent in in response used armed force on 19 November, injuring several demonstrators.</p>
<p>Will the Union be playing a more active role in resolving the various forms of social unrest which have gripped the country for decades?</p>
<p>President Pastrana has asked the European Union to finance the 'Colombia Plan' drawn up by his government. Will the Union see to it that such assistance is not approved until peace agreements have been concluded, thus ensuring that EU funds serve to resolve rather than exacerbate the conflict? How will the European Union ensure that any such assistance is tied to Colombia's acceptance of the recommendations made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, given that human rights have become a crucial aspect of EU cooperation? Will it ensure that any aid plan for Colombia is tied to specific commitments to make the necessary moves towards greater democracy, clamp down on impunity, disband paramilitary groups and introduce social reform, including agricultural reform, compliance with these commitments being subject to regular checks, conducted with the help of European and Colombian NGOs if possible?</p>

<p>The Council believes, as the Honourable Member does, that the conflict that Columbia has undergone for decades is both difficult and complex. The Union has expressed its satisfaction with the announcement that peace talks would continue between the Colombian Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This announcement is evidence of the clear and courageous commitment of the Colombian Government, whose democratic legitimacy is indubitable, to the peace process. The Union has reconfirmed its attention to support as best it can, and by using appropriate means, attempts at a peace agreement based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It also called on all parties involved in the conflict to work in cooperation, which is vital if lasting peace is to be achieved.</p>
<p>On his visit to the European Parliament on 25 October President Pastrana also met the Secretary-General, CFSP High Representative Javier Solana, who reconfirmed to him the Union’s position on Colombia. Until now, the Union has not received any special request to fund concrete projects under the ‘Colombia Plan’.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Union does not consider it desirable that EU aid should not be granted until peace agreements have been made between the legitimate government and armed groups in Colombia. As with everywhere else in the world, the Union, however, is still anxious that the aid it grants will promote a respect for human rights, which is the key factor in cooperation with third countries.</p>
<p>The Union is still following events in Colombia closely, both at the diplomatic level and through its contact with civil society and the European NGOs whose work is influenced by the situation in Colombia.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would like to state that it is not its task to take a position on the possible role of the European Parliament in this connection, as it is an independent institution, whose competence in the area of foreign policy is precisely defined in the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0752"></a>

<p>The Council supports cross-border cooperation. The importance of this kind of cooperation has grown even more in recent years in relations between the newly independent States, the European Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as there is a common border with the newly independent States now that Finland is in the Union, the Baltic region is becoming ever more important as the Union enlarges, and the western borders of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are developing in their preparations for accession.</p>
<p>The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the Communities, their Member States and the newly independent countries specifies the conditions for gradual convergence within the framework of broader European cooperation.</p>
<p>In the European Union’s joint Russian strategy, which was decided in the European Council in Cologne on 4 June 1999, it was stated that the European Union would support strengthened cross-border and regional cooperation and would draft a plan for appropriate tools within the EC and the Member States to try to enhance the participation of particularly important regions of Russia, as far as the EU is concerned, in EU programmes.</p>
<p>In addition, there is provision in the TACIS programme for support for action to promote cooperation among the Member States, the regions and the border areas. Special attention is to be paid to border crossing arrangements between the newly independent states and the Union, and the newly independent states and Central Europe, as well as measures for the border between Finland and Russia to compare with those brought in in the relevant area between the Union and the PHARE countries. </p>
<p>It can be said, especially with regard to Karelia, that the Finnish areas of North Ostrobothnia, Kainuu, North Karelia and the Karelian Republic within the Russian Federation have decided to establish an area of cooperation, the Karelian EU Border Area. The Finnish regional authorities adopted the memorandum in September 1999, and the Karelian Republic authorities adopted it just recently. A main aim of the Karelian EU Border Area is to make cross-border cooperation more effective by means of a development programme and a common decision-making procedure. The programme is to be implemented with Interreg and TACIS appropriations and national funds. This is the first project on the Russian/Finnish border to embrace non-EU territory. </p>
<p>Furthermore, special attention is being paid to cooperation between the newly independent States and the Union and the newly independent States and Central Europe in terms of large geographical areas.</p>
<p>Cross-border cooperation is being implemented within the framework of the TACIS programme, so as to achieve the greatest possible synergy with that part of the Community programme on interregional cooperation (Interreg) that deals with cross-border cooperation, and the PHARE programme for cross-border cooperation. I might remind everyone, in this connection, that the Commission delivered a communication on this subject of cross-border cooperation to the European Parliament, the Council, and the Committee of the Regions, in May 1997. </p>
<p>With regard to cross-border cooperation within the framework of the PHARE programme, I would remind everyone that cooperation involves structural action and from now on not only the border areas between the EU and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe but also the border areas between these various countries themselves.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0753"></a>

<p>The Council has noted the decision by the Turkish Appeal Court on 15 November not to carry out the death penalty handed down on 29 June 1999 to Abdullah Öçalan by the State Security Court in Ankara.</p>
<p>The Presidency of the European Union has repeatedly conveyed, and will continue to convey to the Turkish authorities the position the Union has unanimously taken regarding its opposition to the death penalty as a question of principle, irrespective of the defendant or the crime. At the same time, the Council has always clearly expressed its condemnation of all forms of terrorism.</p>
<p>The Council would like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that it is at the discretion of the Turkish Parliament whether or not the death sentence passed by the Turkish court should be upheld. The Council continues to express its hope that Turkey will continue with the practice it has been adopting over the last 15 years, and not carry out the death sentence. The European Council at Helsinki granted Turkey EU candidate status. On the basis of the Helsinki conclusions, it is very important to point out that the non-application of the death penalty is a part of the common values of the European Union, and thus also a part of Union law. </p>
<p>The Council also understands that the Turkish Government intends to await the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, which asked Turkey on 30 November 1999 to “take all necessary action to ensure that the death sentence is not implemented, so that the court can make effective progress in its examination of the correct conditions and justification for considering the plaintiff’s appeal.”</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0757"></a>

<p>The European Union does not call into question the national sovereign rights of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to its own national airspace. It has on many occasions declared its support for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The EU would like to remind everyone that it is firmly committed to the establishment of a democratic government in all parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within its present borders, and that it notes with satisfaction the democratic reforms that have been made in Montenegro. The Council thus decided to lift the ban in respect of Montenegro and in doing so is showing its support for the ongoing process of reform that the democratically elected government in Montenegro is involved in. In addition, the Council decided to lift the flight ban in respect of the province of Kosovo, for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>The improvement in relations between the EU and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will require decisive action aimed at democracy on the part of that country and total cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia. Decisions on sanctions are to be taken on the basis of developments in the situation as they are achieved in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>With regard to the 1994 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, it has to be said that the EU is not a party to the agreement.

<p>The Commission understands, like the Council, that these are very significant and difficult times for Croatia and for Croatians.</p>
<p>Croatia must adjust to a future without President Tudjman, who, as the leader who steered his country to independence, will always have an important place in Croatian history.</p>
<p>But when this immediate period of mourning is over, Croatia will need to face the future, and decide how best to move forward, to chart a course that will enable it to take its rightful place in the family of European democracies. And she will need all the support of her friends in the Union as she does so.</p>
<p>That is why the Commission hopes – that the forthcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections, when they are held, will mark a turning point for Croatia.</p>
<p>It is vital that those elections should be genuinely free and fair, and seen to be so.</p>
<p>The Commission does not seek to interfere.</p>
<p>All that is asked, as friends of Croatia, is that there should be a level playing field in those elections – not just at the ballot box, but in other crucial areas like access to the media, especially television.</p>
<p>On that basis, the Commission hopes to be able to work closely with the new government. It will look to that government to live up to the standards of accountability and openness that is expected from aspirant members of the European Union. It shall match its cooperation to economic and political reform it carries out. It is hoped that if Croatia lives up to the commitments it has made, it could benefit before long from the Stabilisation and Association process.</p>
<p>In short, there is now an opportunity for a fresh start in relations between Croatia and the European Union. the Commission remains keen to establish and increasingly close relationship. It will look to Croatia in the coming months to show the same commitment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0773"></a>

<p>The Commission has stressed from the outset its determination to establish the closest possible working relations with the High Representative. It has got off to a very good start. It is already getting into the habit of working closely alongside each other.</p>

<p>The first joint trip was to Kosovo in October, underlining the commitment to the reconstruction effort in the Balkans.</p>
<p>The roles of the External Relations Commissioner and the High Representative for the Common and Foreign Security Policy (CFSP) are mutually reinforcing. The Treaty is clear in spelling out the High Representative's role in assisting the Presidency in the area of CFSP.</p>
<p>The Commission has a clear Treaty-based role and institutional responsibilities in the field of external relations, including common foreign and security policy. The Commission is fully associated with the work carried out in the field of CFSP and has an important responsibility for carrying out and executing agreed policy. The Commission recognises that this is a subject in which Honourable Members and others will continue to take a close interest.</p>

<p>It is widely recognised that the SCR has been a failed experiment which has not improved aid management and has reduced further the accountability of the Community's aid programme. Though the immense backlog of payments might have now been significantly reduced, the fact remains that the project cycle is split, and funding processes remain cumbersome and slow. One group of people designs projects, whilst another implements them. There is no common hierarchy or effective coordination mechanism, and there are increased tensions between the geographical desks and the SCR. When does the Commission propose to review the project cycle, and how does it intend effectively to remarry aid policy and design management so that the European Union can boast a coherent and coordinated development aid programme?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for her timely question. It is pleased to announce to the House the creation of a Review Group within the Commission to work on ways of improving the management of the Union's external aid programmes in parallel with the wider reform initiative. Working under the close supervision of Relex Commissioners, the Review Group will aim significantly to improve the quality and timely delivery of projects while maintaining the highest standards of financial control and accountability. Composed of representatives of all the Commission Services involved with managing external assistance, the Review Group will also draw on the experience of other major international donors like the World Bank and the ERBD.</p>
<p>The first question the Review Group will address is the division of responsibilities for managing external aid, in particular within the project cycle. The President of the Commission highlighted the need to look carefully at this complex question when he announced the recent reorganisation of the Commission's services. It is hoped, on the basis of recommendations from the Review Group, Relex Commissioners will be able to take a decision on the way forward next month. It would be premature for me to opt for any particular solution today, before this work has been carried out.</p>
<p>More generally, it is believed the Honourable Member is overly harsh in her judgements about the achievements of the dedicated staff in the "Service Commun Relex" (SCR) since its creation in 1998. The SCR inherited a huge backlog of late payments and unfinished projects. The new division of responsibilities in the Commission services did not address the fundamental problems of severe staff shortages and excessively burdensome legal constraints. While the upheaval of a major restructuring has no doubt had a short-term impact, as it would in any organisation, concrete improvements are starting to be seen.</p>
<p>The backlog of late invoices was cleared during the summer of 1999. Now all valid invoices are paid within the normal 60-day period (provided budgetary resources are available). The rate of project commitments is also up on last year; A manual of harmonised procedures for external aid contracts was approved on 10 November 1999. This will reduce the number of different procedures from over forty to eight, thus considerably simplifying life for external contractors and the Commission administration;</p>
<p>A standard contract for subsidies has recently been agreed. This should also speed up internal procedures, because less time will be spent checking legal paperwork before projects can be approved;</p>
<p>Greater transparency has been achieved thanks to the highly successful SCR web-site, which provides details of tenders and other useful information for contractors. This site attracted a record number of over 275,000 hits in September 1999.</p>
<p>Plainly, there is still much more that can and must be done. Achieving further concrete improvements in the delivery of external assistance is one of the Commission's top priorities.</p>
<p>The Commission has a huge responsibility to the beneficiary countries and to Union taxpayers to maximise the effectiveness of the very considerable resources managed. That is the only way a real difference to economic prosperity, democracy, human rights and the rule of law throughout the world can be made. Rapid and well-targeted delivery of high-quality assistance is a precondition if we are to be an effective player in world affairs. The Review Group announced today should make a significant contribution to achieving this aim.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0695"></a>

<p>On 5 November 1999, Judge Jackson released his statements of the facts in the case brought by the American Justice Department against Microsoft. This document is still not a final verdict but simply establishes the facts relating to the dominant position held by Microsoft in the PC operating systems market and its practices vis-à-vis some of its competitors.</p>
<p>It is not possible to anticipate a final decision in the American case since we still do not have a final verdict. Nevertheless, it is clear that Microsoft is present throughout the world and that its products are widely distributed within the Community. If the American Justice Department orders remedial action, this will affect the behaviour and commercial policy of Microsoft and will very probably have repercussions for the European markets. The Commission is therefore particularly concerned to observe and monitor the repercussions in Europe of any American judicial decisions.</p>
<p>The Commission and the American competition authorities have been cooperating for several years with regard to competition issues within the framework of the 1991 cooperation agreement. Therefore, the Commission has been kept informed by the American authorities about the proceedings against Microsoft by the American Justice Department concerning Internet navigation software. This case does not, however, prevent the Commission from being able to intervene itself where necessary.</p>
<p>With regard to the actions undertaken by the Commission against Microsoft since the early 90s, it has been active in several cases. These cases include both complaints from third parties and proceedings initiated by the Commission itself. Microsoft has modified its behaviour in several instances in order to comply with European competition rules. In certain cases, Microsoft has itself settled its dispute with the complainant in order to avoid possible action against it by the Commission.</p>
<p>Of course, the Commission is very concerned to prevent any anti-competitive practices in Europe. To this end the Commission is continuing with other cases involving Microsoft, in particular two complaints made against it by some of its competitors and which concern areas not covered by the current proceedings in the United States. In this respect, the Commission wishes to point out that the proceedings, such as those being brought by the American justice system, should establish, on the one hand, Microsoft’s dominant position, but also, on the other hand, the abuse of that dominant position, in accordance with the provisions of Article 82 (ex-Article 86) of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0717"></a>

<p>The Commission applies the same approach to all commercial organisations which are in dominant positions, without regard to the legal status under which they are incorporated. The Commission has already indicated that in its reply to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-4-1998-0836_EN.html">E-0836/98</a> and, subsequently, in its reply to oral question H 515/98 given on 16 June 1998. The competition concerns regarding certain Finnish local telephone cooperatives do not relate to their legal status but to the fact that the rebates granted by these cooperatives could constitute abuses of dominant positions under EC competition law. As already mentioned in the above replies, rebates combined with personal shares in cooperatives which aim or have as effect to bind the customer to use only this cooperative can – in line with the case law of the Court of Justice – be considered as an abuse of a dominant position, especially when leading to price discrimination. Such rebates obviously discourage these subscribers to switch to competitors who cannot use rebates basing on the return on investments made in the past when sheltered by monopoly rights, as the relevant cooperatives.</p>
<p>Already in 1997 – in the framework of the preparation of the third report on the implementation of the Community Telecommunications Directives – the Commission raised the possible incompatibility with the Treaty competition rules of such rebates by local telecommunications operators, and in particular by the Helsinki Telephone Company.</p>
<p>The initiatives taken by the company are suitable to remedy the concerns mentioned. The Commission decided therefore to close the administrative procedure opened regarding this possible infringement to the Treaty rules.</p>
<p>It should in this regard be emphasised that Community competition rules only prohibit abuses of a dominant position on a substantial part of the common market. The Commission therefore does not intend to investigate the rebate practices of smaller local telephony operators which do not have a dominant position on a substantial part of the common market. This matter must be assessed under national competition law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0769"></a>

<p>The Commission cannot accept to extend the validity of the current regional aid map for the United Kingdom until 31 March 2000 in case that the new map has not been approved before 31 December 1999.</p>
<p>By letter dated 24 February 1998, the Commission proposed on the basis of Article 88(1) (ex-Article 93) of the EC Treaty to the Member States to limit the duration of the existing regional aid maps to the 31 December 1999. This was accepted by the United Kingdom and by all the other Member States. The Commission further asked Member States in the same letter to submit their proposal for a new regional aid map by 31 March 1999. This delay was set in order to allow for the timely approval of regional aid maps before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Member States have been reminded several times of the need for timely notifications and of the requirements established by state aid rules to be respected by the new regional aid maps.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom notified its proposal for the future map by letter dated 15 July 1999. Replies to the Commission's requests for additional information were sent last time in October 1999. Additional information was also provided at several meetings with the British authorities, of which the last was held on 25 November.</p>
<p>The Commission regrets that due to the delayed notification and to the incompleteness of the notification, it will not be in a position to approve the United Kingdom map by the end of 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently assessing additional information on several crucial points which it has received on 3 December 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission reminded Member States at several occasions of the important consequences of such a situation, last time by letter dated 26 October 1999. Member States for which no new regional aid map will have been approved before 1.1.2000, will not be able to grant any regional aid from 1.1.2000 until the date on which a new map is approved by the Commission.

<p>In March 1998, the European Investment Bank granted a loan of about ITL 60 billion to Gardaland S.p.A., for the purpose of enlarging the leisure park of the same name. The author of this question harbours doubts about the advisability of granting the loan to a company which has substantial assets and is located in a region which is flourishing economically and which is particularly valuable and very important in ecological terms. When it was asked about the nature of the investment planned by Gardaland, the Bank argued that it was unable to forward the relevant documents on the grounds of the confidential nature of relations between the Bank and its customers.</p>
<p>In view of the links between the ECOFIN Council and the EIB Board of Governors, could the Commission state whether it intends to take measures to make information relating to decisions by the EIB more transparent and accessible, particularly where such decisions have major repercussions on a region's development?

<p>The Commission refers to the answers given to previous Parliamentary written Questions (1522/99 and 2513/98) on the EIB's financing for the upgrading of Gardaland's facilities. In these answers, the reasons for advancing a loan as well as the expected benefits for the region's economy have been duly set out.</p>
<p>As regards transparency, the EIB is committed to an active public information policy, aimed at improving knowledge and understanding of its mission and activity in support of Community objectives. In March 1997, the Bank adopted the guidelines for its information policy and the rules on public access to documents, which were published in the Official Journal No. C 423/13 on 9/8/1997.</p>
<p>While extending and diversifying its information sources, the EIB takes into consideration its obligations as a bank to respect confidentiality and the legitimate interests of its owners, borrowers, lenders and other third parties. Therefore, documents which originate from outside the Bank cannot be disclosed by the EIB. The applicant may, however, be referred to the origin of the document or to any other source where the document may be available.</p>
<p>As regards financial accounting and procedures which take environmental costs into account, the EIB aims to achieve best environmental practice in so far as its role and responsibilities permit it. It must be stressed, however, that the promoter, Gardaland in this case, is responsible for compliance with the legal obligations and standards relating to the environment. Regulation and enforcement is performed by the competent authorities at Community and/or national level.</p>
<p>In all sectors, environmental investigations form an integral part of the work carried out by the Bank to assess whether a project qualifies for financing. On this basis, the Bank seeks indeed, as far as practicable, to internalise environmental costs and benefits in the economic valuation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to point out that the EIB is an independent institution whose management operates under the authority and the guidelines given to it by the Member States as shareholders of the Bank.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0675"></a>

<p>The Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary affairs, Mr Pedro Solbes Mira, recently stated that there was a significant divergence between the market parity of the drachma and its central parity vis-à-vis the euro and that discussions were being held on this parity.</p>
<p>Given that these remarks have triggered a debate concerning the parity of the drachma when Greece joins Economic and Monetary Union, will the Commission say what issues are involved here?

<p>The current exchange rate of the drachma against the euro is significantly above the central parity of the drachma in the new Exchange Rate Mechanism. This is a fact and this is what the Member of the Commission in charge of Economic affairs has stated.</p>
<p>There has been no discussions by the Commission of changing the central parity of the Greek drachma.</p>
<p>Any such decisions would have to be taken by a common procedure which is set out in the European Council Resolution on the exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union. According to this Resolution:</p>
<p>"Decisions on central rates ... shall be taken by mutual agreement of the ministers of the euro-area Member States, the ECB and the ministers and central bank governors of the non-euro area Member States participating in the new mechanism, following a common procedure involving the European Commission, and after consultation of the Economic and Financial Committee" ... ".. All parties to the mutual agreement, including the ECB, will have the right to initiate a confidential procedure aimed at reconsidering central rates".</p>
<p>It follows that the Commission would not have the right to initiate such a procedure, but any such procedure would have to involve the Commission.

Reference is made in particular to part of Amendment No 33 which exempted certain temporary copies from the reproduction right only in so far as they related to authorised use.</p>
<p>The Commission shares Parliament’s concern to ensure meaningful harmonisation of copyright, which promotes innovation, investment and creativity Community-wide taking due account of all rights and interests involved. This has also been highlighted by the previous Commission on 9 February in the context of the first reading of the proposal. In this session, as well as subsequently in the amended proposal, the Commission explained in some detail why it could not accept all amendments, or at least not all elements.</p>
<p>This was in particular the case as regards the introduction in Article 5(1) of the condition that the main act of use of a work should be authorised by the rightsholders or permitted by law. The Commission shares the Parliament's concern to ensure that networks do not serve as vectors for the transmission of pirated content. However, it feels that adding this condition would not be the most appropriate or commensurate means of achieving that objective and, on the contrary, might jeopardise the proper functioning of the networks. It therefore opted to strengthen the conditions applicable to this exception by accepting other parts of the amendment of parliament on this provision. Together with Article 8, on sanctions and remedies, Article 5 as it stands ensures a satisfactory balance between the rights of rightsholders and the legitimate interests of other groups involved (telecommunication operators, users, consumers, and others).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0725"></a>

<p>Vitamin and mineral supplements have attracted considerable attention recently. Rules applicable to these products in Member States differ and create obstacles to intra Community trade. Harmonisation was therefore considered necessary. The Commission circulated a discussion paper back in 1997 that describes objectively the arguments for the different approaches on the various specific points of this subject including the principle on which to base the setting of maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in these products.</p>
<p>These products will be considered as foods and as such will dealt with under food legislation, unless classified as medicines. Any rules will have to ensure that these products, as all foods, are safe. At this stage though the Commission has not yet adopted its proposals. Therefore it can not enter into discussion on any specific points. It is intended to adopt such proposals early next year. These will be proposals for a Parliament and Council Directive. Therefore, there will be without doubt a full and interesting debate on the subject as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0698"></a>

<p>Council Directive 91/639/EEC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs provides for the Commission to present a report on different aspects concerning the keeping of pigs in intensive rearing systems with particular regard to the welfare of sows reared in varying degrees of confinement and in groups.</p>
<p>The Commission asked the Scientific Committee on animal health and welfare to contribute to the abovementioned report elaborating an opinion on the welfare of pigs farmed in intensive conditions.</p>
<p>After the adoption of the opinion by the Scientific Committee, the Commission started to work on appropriate proposals to amend Directive 91/639/EEC in line with new scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The elaboration of a proposal in this field includes the consultation with different experts from Member States, from professional organisations and from the main animal welfare associations.</p>
<p>The Commission is also requesting from Member States information on the inspections carried out in pig farms on their territory following the provisions of Directive 91/639/EC. These data will have to be taken into account for the elaboration of the new proposal.</p>
<p>The draft Commission proposal will address in particular provisions for the keeping of sows in groups and establish separate areas for their normal behaviour patterns. The Commission proposal will then be submitted to the Council and Parliament for approval during the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>The Commission will propose to apply the up-to-date provisions on newly built farms.

<p>The reports of unlawful remuneration payments by the Commission representation in Stockholm have shocked many Swedes and aroused their distrust of the EU. People are asking how the Commission can be expected to manage its other payments if it cannot even do so in a small office with a staff of no more than 20 people. This bad impression is further strengthened by the unavailability of senior staff for comment and the fact that the person in charge at the time is suddenly on holiday. The absence of any sense of responsibility was the main criticism in the report by the Committee of Independent Experts which led to the resignation of the previous Commission. The President of the Court of Auditors has pointed out that, when irregularities are revealed, senior Commission staff all too often claim that they did not know what was going on. Many will regard the Commission's handling of this matter in Stockholm as a test of the new openness and sense of responsibility it promised. This is a matter of principle, regardless of the small sums that may have been involved. It is also important for Swedish confidence in the EU that the Swedish police be given access to all the material it needs for its investigation. </p>
<p>How is the Commission going to bring about an immediate change regarding the assumption of responsibility so that the public is not again to be forced to associate the Commission with a combination of irregularities and senior staff who shirk their responsibilities?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the concerns which the allegations of irregularities in the Stockholm representation have given rise to amongst European citizens, and in particular amongst Swedish citizens. It is, however, important to point out that the Commission has reacted to the allegations with due diligence.</p>
<p>In this respect, the services responsible immediately started a preliminary enquiry procedure, and the matter was referred to OLAF. The latter is carrying out all the necessary investigations at this very moment. The Commission would like to point out the strict confidentiality of these investigations, so as not to prejudice the results of the enquiry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the members of staff who may have been directly responsible for any irregularities have been provisionally relieved of their duties and are on leave. The departure on holiday of the head of the representation at the time – which the Honourable Member refers to – simply shows the concern of the interested party and the Commission not to hinder the investigation, and reflects a strict respect for the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>If OLAF confirms the alleged irregularities, it will fall to the Commission to take the appropriate action against those responsible, in accordance with the statute.</p>
<p>The Commission also draws the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that it is the responsibility of the President of the Court of Auditors alone to take responsibility for his words with regard to the attitude of the Commission officials in this matter.</p>
<p>With regard to the cooperation with the Swedish police which the Honourable Member wishes to see, the appropriate contacts have been made by OLAF, in accordance with the legislation and procedures in force.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to respond more closely to the question of reform in the area of responsibilities raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission would like to point out the proposals which were included at this stage in its communication of 15 November 1999, entitled “Suggestions for a reform strategy” (doc. SEC(1999) 1917/2), and which will be developed and expanded on in a communication in February 2000 on the reform strategy.</p>
<p>Without anticipating the specific details which will be defined after a broad consultation – which Parliament is very keen to see – with a number of bodies, including the European Parliament, the Commission considers that strengthening of responsibility should involve three main channels: action with regard to personnel, both through an improvement in recruitment and through the development of training; action with regard to disciplinary procedures, which will have to be more efficient; and finally, action with regard to the financial mechanisms, through the establishment of a system based on the internal control of services and the creation of an internal auditing department.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0714"></a>

<p>In view of the recent undermining of consumer confidence in food safety and of the European consumer's clear concern over the standards which apply to the food industry in the US, can the Commission state how, in the context of the WTO Millennium Round, it will defend the rights of the European consumer?

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that consumer confidence in food safety has deteriorated over recent years, linked with issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and dioxin. The Commission therefore stated several times that food safety is a major issue, not only in international trade but also for internal production. It is for this reason that the Commission is working actively on the white paper on food safety which the Member of the Commission in charge of health and consumer protection is preparing and which is due to be adopted in the Commission on 22 December. This paper will deal with the aspects of food safety from the “stable to the table”, and in particular on domestic production, imported food and the establishment of a food agency.</p>
<p>As concerns the World trade organisation and food safety, there appears to be a fear that WTO rules threaten the ability of members to ensure a high level of protection in this area. However, the SPS agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in the hormones case, is very clear: each WTO member can set its level of protection as high as it wishes – even at zero risk, if it so chooses – and can take the measures necessary to achieve that level of protection. For this reason the Commission saw no need to ask for a re-negotiation of that SPS<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Agreement in the new round.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, those who mistrust the WTO in respect of health concerns often point to the hormones case as proof that the WTO can be used to oblige the Community to import hormone treated beef, even when these products present a health risk. The WTO panel found that the Community hormone ban was not based on a proper risk assessment. However, the Community now has independent scientific advice suggesting a risk associated with beef produced with hormones. Consequently, the Community has maintained the ban and has launched a new set of studies aiming to provide more scientific evidence.</p>
<p>However, with regard to food safety the Commission had the intention to clarify and strengthen the existing WTO framework for the use of the precautionary principle, in particular with a view to finding an agreed methodology for the scope of action under that principle and guidelines for its implementation.</p>
<p>Regarding labelling, the rules are not clear in the WTO. While in no way intending to use labelling as a weapon to force other countries to accept the Community values without question, the Commission nevertheless had indicated its intention to seek clarity on the scope of labelling possibilities within WTO rules. In this respect the Commission wished to clarify the relationship between WTO rules and non-product related process and production methods, with regard, in particular, to eco-labelling, and in the context of the TBT<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> discussion, where the Commission intended to seek to agree multilateral guidelines on labelling in general.</p>
<p>Now that Seattle has failed to deliver a mandate for a comprehensive negotiating round, the Commission will have to examine how to pursue its objectives regarding food safety and labelling in the post-Seattle context.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s view that these practices should be condemned. They constitute a violation of the human dignity of children and of the fundamental principles of sporting ethics. Sport should play an educational role and contribute to social integration. These practices are the antithesis of the values which sport is supposed to defend.</p>
<p>The Commission has prepared, with the European Council in Helsinki in mind, a report on the evolution of sport in Europe, in which it states that the excessive commercialisation of sporting activities may lead to unacceptable practices. The Commission also stresses the need to protect the health of sportspeople, in particular the younger ones. Furthermore it confirms its commitment to the protection and education of young sportspeople.</p>
<p>However, while sharing the Honourable Member’s approach, the Commission considers that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, this action comes rather within the competence of national authorities, since it directly concerns the working conditions of foreign minors. Therefore, it falls to the Member States to act in the first place.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission points out that Council Directive 94/33/EC, on the protection of young people at work, obliges Member States to take the necessary measures to prohibit child labour. However, it allows Member States to authorise, according to certain conditions and procedures, the employment of children for activities of a cultural, artistic, sporting and advertising nature. The provisions of that directive are applied insofar as the young people in question have a working relationship regulated by the law in force in the Member State. It falls firstly to the authorities in the Member States concerned to examine and assess the situations indicated with regard to their obligations stemming from the provisions of the Community directive incorporated into national legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0716"></a>

<p>The absence of harmonised rules in Europe on articles of precious metals is due to the existence of different systems of marking in the Member States.</p>
<p>Some Member States traditionally follow the system of pre-marketing control under which the marking is struck by an independent body verifying the products generally called “hallmarking”. Other Member States follow the system of post-marking control of the marking that has been stamped on the articles by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice in its Judgment “Houtwipper” ruled that Member States are obliged to recognise equivalent hallmarkings of other Member States and not require an additional national hallmark to be struck on imported articles of precious metals.</p>
<p>As a result of the Court’s judgment and the Commission’s actions, the national hallmarking regulations of the Member States provide for the mutual recognition of equivalent hallmarks.</p>
<p>The monitoring by the Commission of the application of national rules on hallmarking revealed that no major problems exist in intra-Community trade of articles of precious metals.</p>
<p>This is proven by the increasing volume of trade between Member States applying different hallmarking systems. Nevertheless, some minor disparities of the hallmarking systems between Member States continue to exist and are the subject of a few complaints submitted by economic operators and are currently treated by the Commission.</p>
<p>However, the differences between a hallmarking system and a post-market control approach justify barriers to trade. Therefore, the Commission has adopted a proposal for a harmonisation directive aiming at approximating the different systems of marking in order to eliminate these barriers.

<p>The further preparation and gradual implementation of the “Brenner project” (upgrading and partly new construction of the railway line between München and Verona, including a base tunnel between Innsbruck and Fortezza) should not be affected by the outcome of the case concerning the Autobrennero concession.</p>
<p>The Commission has supported the Brenner project (including studies concerning the proposed Brenner base tunnel) in the past through financial aid under the trans-European transport network budget line and participated in the work of the intergovernmental commission which coordinates the preparation of the Brenner base tunnel project.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that, on the part of the Member States which are the responsible parties for the implementation of the Brenner project, continuing efforts will be made to gradually upgrade/build this TEN railway line.</p>
<p>The Brenner project has been identified in the Guidelines for the trans-European transport network, as a project of common interest; it is also included in Annex III to the Guidelines, setting out the 14 projects to which the European Council at Essen on 9/10 December 1994 attached particular importance. At this stage of discussion, it is neither foreseen to propose changes to the relevant “project of common interest” nor to Annex III. Not least the expected increase in rail traffic (in particular freight) along the Brenner line in the coming years calls for undiminished commitment by all parties involved towards the implementation of the infrastructure project.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0732"></a>

The experiences of the Demonstration Programme were also intended to lead towards proposals for possible additional measures to be carried out in concert at the European and other levels to promote a sustainable development of European coastal zones. The Demonstration Programme was seen as a pragmatic approach to developing a proposal for an ICZM Strategy, as requested by the Council in its resolutions of 25 February 1992 and 6 May 1994.</p>
<p>The ICZM Demonstration Programme finished with a broad consultation, organised on the basis of two “unofficial” documents that summarised the lessons of the programme. The consultation was intended to allow the a priori participation of all interested or affected actors in the preparation of recommendations concerning the appropriate measures to be taken at the Community level to promote ICZM.</p>
<p>The results of the programme and consultation are now being condensed into a Commission Communication which will propose a European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. This Communication is still in the drafting phase, but it is intended to outline a coherent series of measures to ensure that the Community plays an appropriate role in ensuring the sustainable management of coastal zones, in partnership with actors at the national, regional and local level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Commission is aware, Ireland has an extensive coastline. On 19 November last, a British registered vessel, Posidonia, was intercepted off the west coast of Cork following a tip-off and IEP 15 million worth of cannabis was seized in a combined operation by Irish naval, customs and police forces. The drugs were destined for export to continental Europe. Despite successes in seizing illegal drugs, it is estimated that a drug trafficker's chance of landing undetected shipments in Ireland is 20 times greater than on other European coastlines.</p>
<p>Given that drug smuggling has no borders and is operated on a European and world-wide basis and that the EU is bound by the Treaty to fight illicit drug trafficking and, furthermore, taking into account the recent conclusions of the Tampere Council and the commitment to addressing the drugs problem in a comprehensive manner, will the Commission, as part of such a commitment, indicate what resources it could make available to the Irish authorities to set up and maintain a US-style coastguard which could be deployed to intercept and deter drug smugglers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member points out, the conclusions of the Tampere Summit did refer to the fight against illicit drug trafficking as being a priority area for police cooperation within the Union.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the European Council called for joint teams to be set up to conduct inquiries in particular into how networks of drug traffickers could be destroyed, and it also called for representatives of Europol to be involved in such inquiries.</p>
<p>The Commission is well aware that the configuration of the Irish coastline is such that it is easier for traffickers to land large quantities of drugs in Ireland than elsewhere and that it is very difficult to keep the entire Irish coastline under surveillance. However, countries other than Ireland also have similar geographical features.</p>
<p>The Commission is not planning to propose that specific resources be allocated to fund an increase in the numbers employed in the Irish Coastguard Service; since it takes the view that that is a matter for the Member States. Union Programmes – OISIN and Customs 2000 – have, however, been implemented in order to support cooperation between services combating illicit trafficking.

<p>The programme for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation was delayed for a number of reasons, among which were the following:</p>
<p>The tender relating to supply of 40 000 tonnes of pork meat was suspended from 8 June 1999 until 19 August 1999 as a result of the dioxin problem in Belgium. When re-opened, due to an absence of offers for certain lots, only 36 500 tonnes were purchased, bringing the total pork purchased to 58 500 tonnes. The mobilisation of pork meat, requiring a two phase tendering process (purchase tender followed by transport) is particularly lengthy compared to the mobilisation of intervention goods.</p>
<p>Agreement was not reached until mid-July on net pork prices to be used in estimating internal sales prices in Russia, these estimates to be used as a basis for advance payments by the Russian authorities into a special account.</p>
<p>Revised list of destinations presented by Russian authorities required Commission approval which did not take place until 28 July 1999.</p>
<p>Delivery of beef meat under the third tranche was suspended during a period of two weeks due to an insufficiency of storage space at the destinations designated by the Russian authorities.</p>
<p>On several occasions, the Commission considered the prices offered to be too high and therefore passed to the second tendering date which resulted in a delay of two weeks on each occasion.</p>
<p>Completion of the programme as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding would call for the further mobilisation of approximately 41 500 tonnes of pork, 10 000 tonnes of beef and 5 000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder. If a political decision is taken to do so, it will require a non-automatic carry forward of credits from the 1999 financial year to the year 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0740"></a>

Although in 1999, a return to a more normal seasonal marketing pattern has been seen, this has given rise to an oversupply of lambs on the market. In order to alleviate the situation, the Commission adopted a measure introducing aid for private storage at the beginning of October, as well as the second advance on the ewe premium which was payable from the middle of October. There are no indications of a recovery in prices. Since the end of October, prices in Ireland have risen by almost 14%.</p>

<p>The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendation concerning the limitation of capacity of fleets fishing for northern albacore will be implemented through a proposal for a regulation on technical measures applicable to fisheries for highly migratory fish. In order to have a more coherent Community policy, the commission proposes to integrate the measures adopted by the different tuna management organisations of which the Community is a contracting party into one single specific regulation. This proposal is currently at the final stages of preparation by the Commission, and will be submitted to the Council at the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that an effective control of fishing activities is of the utmost importance for the proper implementation of conservation measures applicable to albacore, as well as other stocks. To this end, each Member State is responsible for the deployment of sufficient means of inspection and surveillance.</p>
<p>The Commission will use its power as under Article 29 under Regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93, in order to verify on the spot the implementation of control and conservation measures by the Member States.</p>
<p>As regards any measures for the management of the northern albacore fishery on the initiative of the Community, ICCAT referred the matter to its SCRS (Standing Committee for Research and Statistics) with a view to evaluating the strength of current fishing and proposing any appropriate measures, should current measures be deemed unsatisfactory. As far as the Community is concerned, it is up to the Member States to provide the best data available. </p>
<p>As regards the relationship between ICCAT and the phasing out of driftnets, it is to be noted that these obligations are of a different nature; the ICCAT recommendation concerns all fishing gear participating in the northern albacore fishery, not only driftnets.

<p>The Commission regrets the postponement of the adoption of the draft law on the modernisation and development of the public electricity service, intended to transpose, in France, Directive 92/96/EC on the common rules for the internal electricity market and to guarantee the right of electricity producers from other Member States to supply potentially eligible French consumers, and the right of French consumers to the free choice of their supplier.</p>
<p>After the failure of the joint committee of the French Senate and National Assembly of 18 November 1999, the Commission gave France notice to present its observations within 15 days, on 24 November 1999, in accordance with Article 226 (ex-Article 169) of the EC Treaty. The Commission then reserves the right to issue a reasoned opinion. On 2 December, Mr Pierret, French Secretary of State for Energy, informed the Council on Energy that the French Government had laid down provisions with a view to adopting the law in February 2000.</p>
<p>On the initiative of Électricité de France and in agreement with the French Government, industrial consumers of more than 100 Gwh (that is, 22% of the market) benefit from access to the network on the basis of public tariffs, for the transmission of electricity which may be bought from suppliers from other Member States.</p>
<p>The decision to implement the harmonisation clause of Article 19, paragraph 5, of Directive 92/96, falls to Member States. The Commission monitors its correct application and, in particular, that the market in the Member States concerned stays open to all potential consumers with regard to eligible consumers of more than 100Gwh and, where necessary, those declared eligible on the basis of the minimum degree of openness required by the directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0749"></a>

<p>The Board of Directors of ABB ALSTOM POWER, a company created by a merger on 30 June 1999, has announced plans to restructure its activities. Job losses have already been announced in some countries where the company operates. However, that scant initial information does not seem to be the last we shall hear about it. The situation, which is particularly harmful in terms of employment, raises a number of questions, with particular regard to the truthful nature of the information given to the European Works Council created in May 1996. There is, accordingly, a more urgent need to review and update the European Works Council Directive. Lessons must be learned from these events. Should not the Directive be amended and have incorporated in it the requirement of a six-month suspensory time-limit applicable to any restructuring plans so that an independent trade union report may be drawn up?

<p>The Commission has always underlined that whilst decisions on corporate restructuring must be left to companies, everything should be done to adopt a positive approach encompassing notably:</p>
<p>- the search for solutions which avoid serious social consequences like massive dismissals</p>
<p>- that these operations must be done in an acceptable manner in particular following proper and effective worker information and consultation.</p>
<p>According to the information available, the announced restructuring within ABB Alstom Power does not, at this stage, raise particular concerns as regards compliance with existing Community and national rules in the field of workers involvement, notably with regard to the Collective Redundancies Directive and the European Works Councils Directive.</p>
<p>However, this announcement by ABB Alstom Power highlights again the weakness of the Community and national legal framework in this field. The Commission's "Proposal for a Council Directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community" (November 1998) aims to eliminate this weakness.</p>
<p>With regard to the Directive on European Works Councils, the Commission is currently assessing the operation of the Directive in consultation with Member States and social partners at European level. After this review process, and taking account of the progress achieved concerning the proposed framework Directive on information and consultation, the Commission will take the appropriate decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0751"></a>

<p>The question of the Honourable Member refers to a call for proposals aimed at improving the financial environment of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) (98 C 263 of 20 August, 1998), with deadlines of 30 September 1998 and 30 September 1999, to be financed under the Multiannual Programme in favour of SMEs (1997-2000).</p>
<p>The Commission intends to develop financial engineering instruments in two fields: networks connecting informal investors (so-called Business Angels) and business creators on the one hand, and mutual guarantee schemes in order to facilitate access to loans on the other.</p>
<p>There was considerable interest in the call for proposals. In order to speed up support for the Business Angel networks, it was decided that the best proposals introduced in September 1998 should be financed under the 1998 and 1999 budget (without waiting for the deadline of autumn 1999), leaving the proposals submitted by 30th September 1999 for commitment under the 2000 budget.</p>
<p>During the last 12 months, the issue of Business Angels has attracted an increasing amount of attention due to the recognition of the important role that Business Angels Networks play in providing equity finance for new, young businesses. Thus a very large number of proposals were submitted by the 30 September 1999 deadline: 61 proposals for Business Angels networks and 13 proposals for Mutual Guarantee societies, exceeding the forecast available budget for 2000 by more than 8 times. This means that the selection committee will have to make a very thorough assessment.</p>
<p>The work programme of Directorate-General for Enterprise under the Multiannual Programme for SMEs for 2000 was approved by the management committee of the Member States on 3 December 1999, so that participants in the call will be informed of the outcome of the selection process early next year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0758"></a>

<p>The Commission has paid particular attention to this worrying situation and safeguard measures have been adopted as the epidemic has developed.</p>
<p>The Commission has furthermore contributed to the cost of the disease-combating measures implemented by the Greek authorities within the framework of the provisions laid down for the payment of veterinary expenses incurred through emergency interventions.</p>

This provision is due to enter into effect retroactively from 28/9/1999.

<p>The Commission would inform the Honourable Member that it is unaware of the specific bill which is currently before the Greek Parliament.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that if the contracts covered by the bill fall within the ambit of the Community Public Procurement Directives, namely Directives 92/50/EEC on public service contracts, 93/36/EEC on public supply contracts, 93/37/EEC on public works contracts and 93/38/EEC on utilities contracts, their award may only be made in full compliance with the corresponding terms of the directives.</p>
<p>The Commission would stress that the directives in question impose a number of obligations on the contracting authorities, which cannot be waived on the basis of national legislation which is not in conformity with the terms of the directives. Thus a call for tenders has to be published in the official journal. Time limits for the submission of tenders have to be respected, and specific award procedures have to be followed. Any exception to the application of these rules has to be also in conformity with the exceptions expressly provided for by the directives.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that one of the conditions for the financing of specific projects under the second Community support framework is the compliance with Community Public Procurement rules.</p>
<p>The Commission would finally observe that the submission of the contracts to the Greek Court of Auditors for approval constitutes a national law requirement which is not imposed by the public procurement directives and that therefore remains within the field of competence of the Greek authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0766"></a>

<p>On several occasions during the autumn, the Commission has stressed the importance of more open and transparent communication within the Commission, between the various institutions and with the public. I believe this to be important as freedom of expression is of fundamental significance for a free society. At the same time, I was disturbed by the Commission's handling of the van Buitenen affair after he published his book last autumn. I became even more alarmed when I watched an interview with Mr Kinnock on Swedish television on 28 October in which it became evident that the Swedish approach to public access and openness can hardly be applied in an international organisation such as the EU.</p>
<p>In the light of the foregoing, will the Commission say how it intends to apply the principle of public access to information within the Commission and whether it intends to impose constraints on this form of freedom of expression?</p>
<p>What does the Commission intend to do in practice to break this culture of secrecy and ensure that the EU institutions, particularly the Commission, become more open and transparent?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member rightly points out, the Commission attaches the utmost importance to the transparency of its work. In fact, it considers that transparency ensures the greatest possible participation of the citizens in the decision-making process, and guarantees the greatest legitimacy, efficiency and responsibility of the administration with regard to the citizens. In this context, one of the key measures adopted by the Commission concerns public access to its documents. This is why in February 1994 the Commission adopted a common code of conduct with the Council on access to their documents. This code establishes the principle that the public should have the greatest possible access to the internal documents of the institutions, with the exception concerning the preservation of public and private interests and the confidentiality of their deliberations.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 255 of the EC Treaty, it falls to the Commission to present a legislative proposal on the general principles and limitations governing the exercise of citizens’ right to access to the documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This new legislation, which will be common to all three Institutions, will replace the previous rules and will aim to optimise access to documents with the greatest possible respect for openness. The Commission has already carried out significant preparatory work with a view to presenting this legislative proposal to Parliament, envisaged for the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>The right of citizens of the Union of access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents enshrined in Article 255 of the Amsterdam Treaty implies at the same time that officials can provide information which falls within the public domain. The limitations to the general principle of access based on recognised public or private interests which must be protected, are the embodiment of the obligation of discretion laid down in the Staff Regulations for Community officials.</p>
<p>As regards the freedom of expression the Staff Regulations effectively impose on the official a duty of loyalty to his employer and contain restrictions on disclosure insofar as the official must act with discretion with regard to information he receives in the exercise of his duties and which is not in the public domain. This does not constitute an obligation of absolute secrecy but a justified restriction in cases where non-disclosure is essential for the functioning of the Institutions or the safeguard of rights of third persons for example.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is an obligation for all staff to ask for prior authorisation for publications, but the authorisation can only be refused if the publication is liable to prejudice the interests of the Communities.</p>
<p>All these restrictions are subject to control by the Tribunal and the Court of Justice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0776"></a>

<p>The answer to my previous question to the Commission concerning brominated fire-retardants gave rise to several more questions.</p>
<p>In reply to my question as to whether the Commission intended to press for an EU ban on brominated fire-retardants, the Commission answered that a proposal for a ban had been withdrawn in 1995. In reply to my question as to whether a unilateral Swedish ban would constitute a threat to the free movement of goods and therefore be contrary to EU legislation, I was referred to Articles 28 and 30 of the Treaty. An interpretation on the basis of Article 95(5) and subsequent paragraphs would suggest that Sweden may introduce a ban only if the problem is specific to Sweden. Brominated fire-retardants are equally dangerous for all.</p>

<p>With regard to the reasons why in 1995 the Commission withdrew its proposal dating from 1991 banning the marketing of all diphenyl polybromide oxides, it should be mentioned that Parliament at the time had not issued an opinion at first reading, which prevented the codecision procedure from being completed. However, the Commission embarked upon, and is in the process of completing, an evaluation of the risks associated with three of these substances and their use, within the framework of Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93. The results of this evaluation will allow the Commission, where necessary, to propose appropriate measures for the reduction of these risks. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that, since the mid 1990s, the brominated fire-retardants industry has implemented, within the framework of the OECD, a voluntary agreement with a view to improving their control of these products.</p>
<p>The honourable member of the Parliament mentioned the applicability of Article 95(5) of the EC Treaty. To respond to this, the following clarification should be made. Only in such areas where harmonisation has already been adopted, according to the procedure set out in Article 95(1), EC Treaty, is it possible to invoke Article 95(5) of the same Treaty. Harmonisation measures to ban brominated flame retardants have not been adopted.</p>
<p>This leads back to the possible application of Articles 28-30 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>As the Commission mentioned in its reply to the written question 1976/99, a total ban adopted by one Member State could be contrary to Articles 28-30 of the Treaty, as it may impede the free movement of the goods in question; not only brominated flame retardants as such, but also computers and other electrical equipment, which are produced with such flame retardants to reduce the risk of fire.</p>
<p>However, a ban can be justified if it is indistinctly applicable to domestic products, necessary and proportionate. The justification must also be assessed according to the principles of precaution and prevention, the principle of rectifying environmental damage at source, and the "polluter pays" principle.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0777"></a>

<p>The Commission deeply regrets the heavy losses suffered by the Scottish salmon farming industry due to the presence of Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA). This is a severe blow to a sector which is already under strain on account of a fragile market situation for salmon.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned about the consequences of the disease and of the disease control policy for the sector. Possibilities exist under Community legislation for Member States to grant a national financial aid in case of disease outbreaks in the new aquaculture sector. For that purpose, the authorities of the Member State concerned shall notify the draft measures to the Commission. According to the guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture, measures aimed at compensating losses suffered by the producers may be deemed compatible with the common market provided that an eradication plan is decided by the competent authorities. So far the Commission has not received any formal request for Community aid from the British authorities in this case. Community financial compensation does not exist at present. However, Council Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field<a href="#defann_77_1" name="refann_77_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> lists, in its Article 3, the animal diseases for which an emergency financial compensation by the Community may be granted. This financial contribution must be 50% of the costs incurred by the Member State in compensating owners for the slaughter and destruction of animals and for other disease control measures; where vaccination has been decided upon, this must be 100% of the costs of supply of vaccine and 50% of the costs incurred for carrying out the vaccination. ISA is however not included in the list of diseases eligible for compensation. Its inclusion requires a Decision by the Commission in accordance with the procedure of the Standing Veterinary Committee.</p>
<p>Further to Article 3, Council Decision 90/424/EEC introduces in its Article 24 the possibility for a Community financial measure for the eradication and monitoring of certain diseases. This compensation is based on the approval of annual programmes to be submitted by the Member States. These programmes shall supply all the appropriate financial information and shall indicate in particular the total estimated cost of carrying out the programme. The level of Community financial contribution in this case shall be fixed at 50% of the costs incurred by the Member States by way of compensation for owners for the slaughter of the animals. ISA is however not included in the list of diseases to which Article 24 applies. Its inclusion requires a Council Decision upon a formal proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission will examine whether it is appropriate to take action for the inclusion of ISA in one of the lists referred to in Decision 90/424/EEC. Before taking such a decision, the Commission wants to make a complete assessment of the situation in order to have a clear idea about the impact of a decision on financial compensation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
