<p class="contents">As all of us in this House know, the Council does not have the means to investigate actions which are contrary to applicable law in this case. The national authorities are responsible for this sort of enquiry. If, on the other hand, it concerns actions that go against Community legislation, the responsibility lies with the national authorities and the Commission under the supervision of national and Community courts of justice. The Council assumes that current cooperation between private companies like SWIFT and the US authorities will be in accordance with applicable law and in compliance with fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, like Parliament, is a legislating body and, as such, it would like to draw Parliament’s attention to a proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds. This regulation is being discussed by both Parliament and the Council. When this regulation has been passed, it will apply to transfers of funds in any currency sent or received by anyone offering payment services based within the Community. Article 14 of the proposed regulation states that anyone providing payment services must respond immediately and thoroughly to requests made by the authorities responsible for the prevention of money laundering or the financing of terrorism in the Member State in which they are located and which concern data to be disclosed on the payer accompanying transfers of funds and storing this information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that this Community act, in line as it is with fundamental rights, will strengthen the legislative framework needed to prevent flows of dirty money which come about through transfers of funds and which can harm the stability and reputation of the financial sector. At the same time, the regulation will prevent all types of illegal action targeted at the Community financing system. Given how widespread the activity is and the impact it has, the Member States cannot implement the aims of this regulation adequately: it will be effected better at Community level. It is therefore urgent to pass this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation is to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure. On 6 December 2005 the Council agreed on the general conception of the proposal. In the wake of some unofficial meetings between representatives of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the Presidency hopes that a compromise solution for the regulation as a whole can be shortly agreed. We will be closely monitoring the legislative work to prevent, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, illegal and unjustified activity against the financing system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also debating the Commission’s Proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The Commission put forward the proposal on 4 October 2005. The framework decision aims to ensure that personal data on European citizens has a high level of protection. That requires common regulations, so that we can determine the legality and quality of data being processed by the competent authorities in the Member States. Although the proposal will not apply to the financing system directly, it will provide for the protection of personal data and may also be important for a case that is being dealt with. The proposal is being discussed by the competent bodies within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that our common will is to protect European citizens not only from terrorism but also all kinds of illegal activity targeted at the European financing system, with reference too to Community measures and legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, it seems that there was a transfer of financial information between private companies from the EU to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that several authorities in Europe, including the European Central Bank, were informed. I quote from a statement from the American Treasury issued on 23 June: ‘SWIFT is overseen by a committee drawn from major central banks, including the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the lead overseer, the National Bank of Belgium. The overseers have been informed about SWIFT’s participation with the Treasury and the safeguards and assurances put in place’. I repeat that I was quoting there from a statement of the American Treasury.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that this information, of which I am now aware, was not passed on to the Commission previously, because the transfer of such financial information falls within the scope of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. National authorities are primarily responsible for the proper application of the data protection rules. I trust that European Member States will take all the necessary action to ensure that their national data protection legislation is properly applied and strictly enforced. I observe that the Belgian Prime Minister has already asked the Justice Ministry to investigate and that the Belgian Data Protection Supervisory Commission is being equally active in assessing the circumstances under which this particular transfer has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Commission will follow the developments very closely and, if necessary, we will make full use of our powers under the Treaty. I stress that, at this stage, I do not know whether this would be appropriate, as we have first to learn from the Belgian authorities what exactly happened, how and why.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague, Mr McCreevy, stated on Monday before this Parliament, the regulation on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, on which you will vote tomorrow, contains the appropriate safeguards on data protection and access by competent authorities to such data. I recalled that the European Data Protection Supervisor provided a positive assessment and did not detect any data protection concerns. I think, therefore, that the SWIFT affair should not delay the regulation on information on the payer accompanying the transfer of funds, the adoption of which is essential to detecting terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by stressing once again my commitment to the fight against terrorism and to the identification of methods used to finance it, acting, of course, within the full rule of law and in accordance with our fundamental rights.</p>

This information can be found on the company’s website. According to the statement by the Belgian data company, moreover, cooperation with the authorities is intended to prevent misuse of the international financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Government – according to press reports, at any rate – is already investigating whether the US administration’s research activities were in breach of national law, and this is something to which Commissioner Frattini has just referred. The Belgian minister for justice has also set in motion investigations into this matter, and her department is, in the initial stages at any rate, the right one to be investigating this sort of thing, for, according to current law, it is the Belgian legal system that must take action and make inquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering carefully what the Commissioner has just again said, and thinking about how much we know about this at the present time, I have to come to the conclusion that we know nothing for certain, and have not yet reached the stage at which we would be obliged to investigate. We know that there are EU-wide rules on the protection of civilian data, and the planned European legislation on the handling of private data in connection with the prosecution of crime and the war on terror – at least as far as I am aware – is, as things stand, going to contain only rules on how state authorities should handle sensitive data, and so I think we should, as a matter of urgency, aim to use European legislation, once it has been adopted, to intervene and take action at an early opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been confirmed by President Bush and by SWIFT itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Data protection is not an obstacle to the work of the police authorities. Rather, it is there to guarantee respect for fundamental rights. Clearly, European countries were not informed of these activities, but – as you said, Mr Frattini – the European Central Bank would have known about them. The European Central Bank is a European institution. It has to comply with data protection legislation, and that is why we want the European Data Protection Supervisor to check without delay that the European Central Bank has respected the laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must make sure that there is no gap in the legislation on the protection of personal data. Even if we still do not have a European document regulating data protection within the framework of police activities, existing legislation requires respect for national legislation in the case of any exchange of data provided for in the context of public security. Such exchanges must, moreover, be authorised by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also draw the attention of the Council, Mrs Lehtomäki and the Commission to Amendments 26 and 58 of my report on data protection under the third pillar. These are designed to regulate the way in which data is handled when it is collected by private parties in the public interest, and it is in that activity that the problem lies, I believe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I simply want to say to her that I have listened to what she has said and I think it necessary to point out the following: our government takes the form of the Council of Ministers or European Council. Although it may not have the legal or political tools to take a decision regarding this scandal – by which I mean the SWIFT affair – which has followed on from that involving clandestine flights, there is nothing to stop it affirming its moral virtue and saying publicly what it thinks about it - something that, as far as I know, it has still not done.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I wish to say is that I have taken careful note of what the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, said about neither he nor his department knowing anything about this case. I share the opinion of my two fellow Members, Mrs Klamt and Mrs Roure, who have just spoken on this matter. In Europe, and more specifically in the EU, we have progressively constructed a state governed by the rule of law in which any transfer of personal data to third countries must, of absolute necessity, obey national or European rules. The first of these rules states that any transfer must be authorised by a judicial authority, and no one else. Neither a State nor a bank is the owner of the information of which it makes use. If the data concerned relates to companies, it is the property of those companies. If it relates to individuals, it is the property of those individuals. There is no authorisation for others to use it in transactions, to appropriate it, to pass it on to others or to dispose of it in heaven knows what other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the legal instrument exists, and I would recall what Mrs Roure said just now to the effect that it would be a really very important step if we were to succeed in sorting out this matter under the Finnish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say one last thing. There is a French proverb that reads, ‘Do not trust my friends; as for my enemies, they are for me to take care of’. The enemy is terrorism, and our friends are the Americans. After the clandestine flights, the abduction of European citizens rightly or wrongly under suspicion and the illegal transfers of prisoners using aircraft landing on European soil, we now learn that, friend of ours though it may be, a power in alliance with ourselves has been rooting around in our bank accounts. When will the blood samples start to be taken? When shall we start having to submit details of births and so forth? Emphatically, enough is enough. Parliament really does need to put a stop to this type of thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that, if I have properly understood the matter, terrorism is the enemy of our freedoms and, in return, liberty is the enemy of terrorism. It is certainly not the enemy of ordinary people. In this area, too, the United States now needs to decide which side it is on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a matter that should be seen in a wider context, referring to PNR, to the control of communications and to data retention, and this subject is not unconnected with the topic of rendition that we were addressing just a few minutes ago. In fact I would say that the SWIFT affair is the other side of the rendition coin; it may be a less violent operation, but it has exactly the same purpose: to extract information.</p>
<p class="contents">The systematic surveillance of the lives of European citizens has now become commonplace and we are facing what George Orwell called ‘Big Brother’, in the name of the fight against terrorism. I think we should conduct an inquiry into the responsibility of the European Central Bank and national banks, since I believe that this situation is unacceptable.</p>

This programme was confirmed by both SWIFT and the US Treasury Secretary.</p>
<p class="contents">We must restate our determination, on both sides of the Atlantic, to combat terrorism resolutely and effectively, but this must not be at the expense of full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of my personal opinions on the matter, what appears to have happened is that data has been transferred to the United States with the aim of preventing and combating terrorism and other crimes. In other words, these are operations relating to public security and the activities of the Member State in its area of criminal law. If this is the case, it is clearly outside Community law. This was what I took to be Mr Frattini’s first reaction, through his spokesman, when he mentioned the extra-Community nature of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if this was lost in translation, or if Mr Frattini actually told us today, that in his view Directive 95/46 applies in this case. This is an issue that needs to be resolved; either Directive 95/46 will be applied or the situation is outside the first pillar and outside Community law, and therefore the call for this framework decision on data protection under the third pillar to be adopted is justified.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Member States must protect these data. I therefore welcome the decision by the Belgian Government to launch an inquiry to discover what actually happened and the legality in respect of national law. I await the results of this inquiry with interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present resolution contains a number of pertinent questions that have to be asked, because anxiety levels among the public shoot up when they read stories of that kind in the newspapers.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the debates held earlier today, this is yet another case of weighing up security interests against the interests of the civil liberties involved in public and corporate privacy. Once again, this is about activities in the framework of the fight against international terrorism, which may well be carried out behind the backs of the monitoring bodies and may well be in contravention of international agreements guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I do not want to draw direct comparisons between this case and the issue of CIA flights, the SWIFT case is not an isolated one, but an example of the way in which the Americans, in particular, hope to fight terrorism. Today’s debate is yet again an example of the need for discussing the nature of the war we are waging.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case too, we should ask ourselves whether all the rules have been complied with. There is the suspicion, which has also been confirmed, that the European institutions were informed. We want to know exactly what their responsibility in this case is and to what extent they have already been involved in monitoring the implementation of existing rules. Above all, however, we want to prevent a situation in which we all operate in some kind of grey area, with the creation of a legal vacuum in which even the citizens no longer know where they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution contains a number of pertinent comments in that respect. We also want – and this is something that the Commissioner has already mentioned – clarification about the role of the European institutions. In addition, we want any legal loopholes plugged, thus making sure that if a similar exchange of data were to prove necessary in future, it would only be done with solid underpinning and in full compliance with certain guarantees and minimum standards. We would also like to see the Member States being called to account about the implementation of the agreed rules. Once again, we must really prevent people from getting the feeling that they are in a legal vacuum. All loopholes in legislation must be plugged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder how we would react if it were not the United States, but another country, that was checking our bank accounts, and whether we would be equally tolerant of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question of effectiveness, the Council stated a moment ago that this is what is needed in the fight against terrorism. I would draw your attention to the fact that Stuart Levey, the US Under-Secretary to the Treasury, pointed out two weeks ago that they are very successful in tracing financial transactions. This did, though, drive the transactions of terrorists underground and therefore out of our reach and field of vision. In the European Union, we must, as a matter or urgency, adopt cohesive, efficient and common policy that is based on democratic decision-making and guarantees the sound protection of personal data. This really is becoming a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also endorse the view of those who claim that this is not an isolated incident. Rendition flights, and also the handling of passenger details, are making it evident that the United States does not hold to agreements. We in the European Union must speak with one voice and ensure that, together with our ally, we fight terrorism on a legal basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this is about SWIFT in the USA, then that is none of our business. Access to SWIFT data in Europe is a matter administered primarily by Belgian authorities, who should grant all applications for access. At present, the only thing we know is that SWIFT is supposed to share with the USA certain information related to the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two problems here. Firstly, the European Parliament cannot engage in a serious debate about this issue merely on the basis of press coverage and vague statements. Secondly, it has to abide by its treaties and be aware of its areas of jurisdiction. We know that the Belgian authorities have launched an investigation into this, but do not yet have any results. One thing we need to clarify is that access to the SWIFT system does not mean that ordinary transactions, such as the depositing and withdrawal of cash, cheques, electronic means of payment etc., are subject to data mining.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialists and a number of other political groups think otherwise. They have submitted a joint proposal for a resolution in which they state that US authorities have access to the records held by SWIFT and that this was an instance of the USA violating fundamental provisions on personal data protection. These words are not, as Mr Wiersma says, assumptions, because they bandy them around as if they were facts. Similarly, they have disregarded the fact that the Belgian Government is in charge of investigating the case and that the European Parliament has no role to play at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in order to preserve the dignity of the European Parliament and out of respect for EU’s <span class="italic">acquis communitaire</span>, we, members of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, have adopted our own resolution in which we call everyone’s attention to the rules of the game and in which we say that we should only have recourse to such resolutions when we can operate with incontrovertible facts. This is the only way for the European Parliament to preserve its reputation in the public eye and ensure it does not turn into a glorified debating society.</p>

The Presidency takes a very serious view of this, and, as has been said, it is the responsibility of the National Bank of Belgium to oversee SWIFT and we also now await with interest what the Belgian authorities uncover.</p>
<p class="contents">If these investigations uncover facts which require legislation at Union level or harmonisation of legislation, this will be considered in the debate on the legislative plans that are being prepared. This is such an important matter that we need to hold a debate on it in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and that is just what we will do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think it can be said that the SWIFT affair has a special feature, which suggests to me that the 1995 ‘first pillar directive’ on data protection is probably the one that is applicable, since the data was transferred through SWIFT Belgium and SWIFT United States, that is between two private branches of a private organisation. That is why my interpretation, obviously subject to what the Belgian authorities will tell us, is that there would have been a communication to the Data Protection Authority and the national responsibilities of the competent bodies in this case would indeed exist. Unlike the PNR affair, which, as we were correctly reminded by Mr Lambrinidis, involved a transfer from a private airline directly to a US public body, here the transfer was between two private parties. It happens that on US territory, in accordance with US legislation, data transmitted for commercial reasons is used for security purposes. That is the structural difference. The result, as illustrated by Mr Lambrinidis, is that there is a grey area that really needs to be regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there are two immediate possibilities: the first, to be implemented with the help of the Council and the Presidency, consists of rapidly approving the proposal that the Commission has put forward for a framework decision under the third pillar, in order to protect the confidentiality of personal data. To this extent, it is evident that we will at least have covered one area, the one in which data are transmitted for reasons of security, investigation and to combat terrorism. That would leave the first pillar part, that is the transfer between two private parties for commercial reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">A third aspect would still be missing: transfer between a Member State and a third country, that is not data transmitted from the European Union to a third country, but by an individual Member State directly to a third country. This is the third aspect that I think should be examined.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at these three points together, which, quite honestly, do not make for a controversy with the United States of America, but they do concern all third countries, we will be able to get a precise handle on that grey area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
