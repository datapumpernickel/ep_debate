<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Cooperation with drug counselling networks</span></p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between the Commission and the networks it promotes has deteriorated significantly since 1998: contracts between the networks and the Commission are often not concluded until the projects have already been under way for months. The Commission nevertheless insists that the projects should begin on the strength of nothing more than a provisional written notification. Payment of instalments by the Commission is sometimes delayed for years. All the networks are affected by the ever-growing bureaucratic burden and, above all, by the Commission's failure to make repayments, and are very much hampered in their work. Some associations have even had to close down because of delays in payment by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has the Commission not succeeded in recent years in providing the networks it supports with contracts and instalment payments rapidly and in parallel with projects? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These problems have several causes. Firstly, it is clear that there has been a human resources problem in the Public Health Directorate in Luxembourg, which deals with this work. In short, the staff complement has been insufficient to deal with complex procedures and often inexperienced beneficiaries proposing too many small projects. This situation was aggravated last summer when a decision was taken in the light of the report of the Committee of Independent Experts to end the contract with the technical assistance office which helped in the implementation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a large number of small projects are implemented under the anti-drugs programme, placing additional strain on the already limited human resources at our disposal. During the last five years, the average size of projects in terms of co-financing granted by the Commission has been EUR 180,000.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, experience shows that participants in the network have had little understanding of the Commission's contract and payment procedures. In many cases, therefore, the Commission has had to make repeated requests to the drug prevention networks for missing documentation needed to finalise contracts or produce payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the light of experience with subsidies from the Community budget and the criticisms of the Court of Auditors, greater rigour may have been brought to bear on the documentation relating to contract costs, resulting in knock-on effects on the timing of payments.</p>
<p class="contents">In responding to these problems, I am taking a number of steps. The Commission's proposal for a new public health framework and strategy highlights the need for clearer objectives and more efficient management with a greater impact on key priorities. Therefore, fewer but bigger projects will be co-financed in future, making for more efficient use of the human resources needed to manage implementation of the programme. As the budgetary authority repeatedly stresses, we must match resources and priorities more realistically in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as you are aware, following the Commission's recent review of its staffing needs, a request for additional posts is being put forward to the budgetary authority, including a significant increase in posts for the health and consumer protection DG. If the budgetary authority agrees, a number of these posts could be allocated to tackle the kind of problems which we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">The inexperience of contractors regarding financial control requirements will continue to necessitate significant advice and other inputs from already limited staff resources. The Public Health Directorate intends to carry out an information campaign to help contractors to understand the Commission's procedures and requirements more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of red tape, the departments concerned are currently reviewing their documentary requirements with the aim of simplifying and speeding up payment procedures without neglecting the necessary financial control measures. As a result of the measures already taken, the situation has been improving, and I expect it to improve further so that contracts can be agreed more quickly and payments made in accordance with the Commission's 60-day rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Should you have any specific points to make, perhaps you could provide me with the relevant information in writing, and I will certainly raise them with my staff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I call into question the fact that when the Commission encounters problems with the partners participating in particular projects, it attributes at least half of these problems to the partners themselves. I have information to the effect that even small project partners are in full possession of the facts about the contracts and know exactly what they have to submit. I have had a case described to me where the same paperwork was submitted on three separate occasions, but the Commission still maintained that it had never received this paperwork. I therefore wish to put in another request for the application procedure to be attended by extremely clear guidelines laid down in advance. I have encountered problems of this kind before, not just in the drugs sphere, but with many other partners that work with the Commission and seek co-financing. It is not only in the drugs sphere where the application procedure takes such a long time and is so complex, and I believe the problem does not lie wholly with incompetent, small project partners, but can also be put down to the fact that the requirements set by the Commission are not clearly formulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The question remains as to whether we really want to cut back on the small organisations within the European Union, when it is important to support drugs projects – including those in the regions – using a whole range of approaches, specifically in this area, but also in general. I believe it would not be in our interests to only give large organisations a chance to move things forward in this sphere, rather our aim must continue to be that of promoting a variety of organisational structures. That would be a wholly misguided attempt at a solution to my mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the size of projects, since 1996 a total of 149 projects have been selected for over EUR 25 million, with an average amount of EUR 180 000 per project. Under the new health strategy we will reduce the number of projects and increase their value and impact, thereby using our limited human resources more effectively. It does not always follow that smaller projects are better than bigger projects, but if human resources are applied efficiently it will be for the betterment of the projects concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As referred to in the minutes of the plenary meeting of the Scientific Steering Committee of 10 December 1999 the chairman of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment informed the SSC about the SCTEE's intention at its plenary meeting of 25 November 1999 to attach a statement to the minutes of the meeting, clarifying the interpretation of its opinion on phthalates in toys.</p>
<p class="contents">The minutes of the meeting under discussion would normally have been adopted at the occasion of the next SCTEE plenary meeting which took place on 4 February 2000. However, at that plenary meeting several committee members considered that the minutes were in general too long and requested the secretariat to follow the format of other scientific committees. Following this request the committee decided to postpone the adoption of the minutes to the next plenary when the draft of a more succinct version would be available.

What I say now is no reflection at all on the Commissioner himself, but I hope that he would accept with me that science must inform our decisions on risk and how to manage it. In this case the science was less than adequate. It was not validated by peer review and so on. So when it came to the Science Committee and the chairman's views it was significant that his advice – in his words – did not justify a banning action. The resulting ban on other phthalates had nothing whatsoever to do with children's toys or teething rings. This exercise brought into some disrepute the precautionary principle. That principle only holds good if the decisions are scientifically irreproachable. It was not a happy experience and I hope the Commission would agree that both the Commission and Parliament have a lot to learn from this experience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Water needs in the Middle East</span></p>
<p class="contents">The constantly increasing demand for water in the Middle East is set to play a significant part in relation to the outlook for cooperation and understanding among the peoples of the region. After a three-year break, the Steering Committee of the Multilateral Working Group on Water Resources (MWGWR) for the region began work again in 1999 and adopted specific programmes on the saving and use of water resources in the Middle East, with EU funding. The issue of water in the Middle East was also discussed in the context of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and the Israeli side has also raised the subject of further funding for such programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">What policy will the Commission pursue on this matter, with a view to promoting cooperation among the peoples of the region and averting conflicts arising from water needs?</p>

The region has the lowest per capita availability of water anywhere in the world and it is steadily decreasing. Water is indeed one of the main issues of the Middle East peace process, not only in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians but also between Israel and Syria. The Commission's policy focuses on the various dimensions of the water question in the Middle East, the security as well as the economic, environmental and social dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Just and comprehensive water agreements between Israel and its neighbours, sustained by effective regional cooperation, are necessary for lasting peace in the region. The Commission is an active participant in, and a main donor to, the multilateral water working group of the MEPP. As a concrete contribution we have committed another EUR 4 million in 1999 for the completion of the regional water data banks. We also promote the concept of a regional cooperation structure. The Council's special taskforce on water in the Middle East has met with the Israeli, Jordanian and the Palestinian water commissioners and is actively coordinating EU water policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's policy aims at helping the region to achieve a sustainable management of the scarce water resources in combination with assistance to explore new resources. Current water management and consumption in the Middle East cannot be sustained. Estimates suggest that in the overall Mediterranean region agriculture absorbs over two thirds of total national water consumption, while accounting for only one third of GNP and labour. This discrepancy is even sharper in the Middle East. Therefore assisting reform of domestic water policies in the countries of the Middle East is a priority. Indeed the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers Conference in Stuttgart in 1999 decided to make water a priority for the partnership. As a first result the EUR 40 million action plan adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial conference on local water management in Turin in October 1999 would provide a further opportunity for cooperation in this sector. A call for proposals will be published soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to highlighting the seriousness of the problem and its effect on the Middle East peace process, my question was aimed at regarding the lack of water resources as a serious political issue. We all talk about the impending crises over water shortages. Something must be done. Commissioner, what initiatives are you going to take to formulate rules of international law in the management of water resources so as to eliminate any hotbeds of local and regional political antagonism, seeds of crises and a peculiar type of imperialism? Your answer to the Israel – Syria question should go somewhat beyond; to the Tigris and to the Euphrates, to Turkey and to Syria and elsewhere. I believe that rules of international law must be established to manage water resources. These rules must contain clear conditions for all the countries involved, through which rivers that cross more than one country flow. This must also apply to lakes that belong to more than one country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While Member States are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of Community legislation, the Food and Veterinary Office of my Directorate-General undertakes specific control and inspection missions to check that Member States apply Community legislation in an effective and a uniform manner. These checks have revealed certain shortcomings in the compliance of some Member States with the Community legislation. As a result, infringement proceedings based on Article 226 of the Treaty have been opened against certain Member States and others are under evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will shortly present a report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation in the Member States of the Community legislation on the protection of animals during the last quarter of this year. The report will show that Member States currently have difficulties in fully implementing Community legislation. As the conclusion to the report, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals, address the difficulties I have referred to, ensure inspection by the FVO and provide for infringement proceedings if appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as possible, several basic issues of the directive should be evaluated on a scientific basis, notably data concerning travelling times, stress related to loading and unloading operations and loading densities. In this framework, measures to encourage the slaughter of animals closer to the places where they are raised also merit examination.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by assuring you that animal welfare is very high on the agenda of the Commission. I look forward to further discussion when I present the report on transport in the next few weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Communication on children's rights</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the Commission's statement to Parliament to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in November 1999 when it indicated that it would be publishing a Communication on children's rights, can the Commission now give Parliament a definite timetable for the publication of the Communication? Given that the United Nations General Assembly's Special Session (UNGASS) on children will take place in September 2000, what is the Commission's plan for coordinating EU and Member State input to the Special Session? Is the Commission prepared to acknowledge that, in view of the special session, a Communication on children's rights is of the utmost importance?</p>

In his letter the President made absolutely clear the Commission's commitment to all measures which safeguard children's rights and mention a number of areas both external and internal where the Commission was active on these highly important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the President also sought to situate the Commission's action in these areas, as in others, in the context of the Treaties' revision. He acknowledged that competence for action concerning children remains primarily with the Member States given the lack of a clear legal basis in the Treaty for the Community to safeguard children's rights in terms that go beyond the existing framework.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current framework the European Commission has already undertaken a considerable number of initiatives to protect children's rights as in the Daphne and Stop programmes which fall under my competence. The Commission is also pursuing action in the social and educational field with a view to improving the situation of children.</p>
<p class="contents">Further evidence of the importance we attach to this subject can be found in the fact that it was the Commission which undertook the initiative to include a specific article on children's rights into the charter of fundamental rights. The draft article concerning the protection of children incorporates the main principles of the New York Convention as the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being and consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to insist that the charter foresees the prohibition of the employment of children. In his letter the President also expressed the view that it could indeed be useful for the Commission to evaluate if all Member States have pursued the content of UN Convention on the rights of the child. Although all the Member States have ratified the Convention, its implementation varies widely and the views of the Member States on how to best protect children's rights diverge to a considerable extent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my conviction that such an evaluation might represent a useful contribution for the participation of the Union in the special session of the United Nations general assembly in September 2001. The Commission believes that its ongoing actions in favour of children, its active advocacy for an appropriate inclusion in the charter of fundamental rights and its support for this idea of having an evaluation as described represents evidence of its commitment to this important subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a matter of fact, we are both talking about the same thing, which is the United Nations Special Meeting of the General Assembly on Children's Rights in September 2001 next year. Since we are talking about that my approach is that we should have a study to evaluate how the United Nations Convention on Children's Rights has been implemented in our Member States. This study should be completed in time to be used as basis for the Union's participation in the United Nations Special General Assembly next year.</p>

Children are being used by mothers from eastern and central Europe on the streets of our cities for begging. They are mostly coming into the Union as refugees. Either they should be taken into care or the begging is unjustified because they should be receiving social benefits from the state. This is something perhaps which should be added to the list of child abuse which we as a Community ought to be looking into very carefully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are therefore people who, when travelling to see football matches at Euro 2000, were subject to checks carried out at the external borders of the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be borne in mind that for the duration of Euro 2000, the Belgian and Dutch Governments made use of a safeguard clause in Article 2(2) of the Schengen Agreement, which lays down that, when public order or national security are threatened – and in my view, the fear generated by these cases of ‘hooliganism’ certainly meets these criteria – a Member State may decide that, for a limited period, national border controls, adapted specially for the situation, can be implemented, even at internal borders within the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian and Dutch Governments adhered to the prior consultation procedure laid down by the Schengen Agreement. The controls that are envisaged therein were temporarily reintroduced at internal borders, but this was not carried out in a systematic way. These were targeted checks, specifically based on information supplied by the Member States in the framework of police cooperation, concerning supporters likely to pose a threat to public order.</p>
<p class="contents">Establishing controls at the external borders and, temporarily, at the internal borders of the Schengen area is not the same as closing a border or systematically turning away people who wish to enter the territory in order to attend a football match. In accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Union’s citizens have the right to move freely through the territory of Member States. Restrictions may be imposed, however, for reasons of public order and in individual cases only, i.e. when the person concerned represents a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to society’s fundamental wellbeing.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I say that Community law does not allow for a collective restriction to be imposed. Having the nationality of a given Member State and wanting to attend a football match are not sufficient grounds for being turned back at the border. This is why an assessment of the measures for cooperation between the authorities of the Member States concerned is already underway and why this joint exercise aims to learn the lessons of Euro 2000, in order to see how police and judicial cooperation can in the future be improved in terms of combating hooliganism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Considerable progress has been achieved so far. The Portuguese Presidency submitted a draft Council regulation at the end of June 2000. The French Presidency aims at adding a Council decision adopted by the end of this year. This would make it possible to meet the deadline of having the European police college in place by 2001, as mentioned in the Commission's scoreboard on justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Member States are in favour of creating the European police college as a permanent network of national training institutes. Other Member States regard the current presidency proposal for a network as a temporary stage on the road to an institution at a fixed location. The Commission has, from the beginning, insisted that the European police college will become a fixed institution after having functioned as a network for an initial period in line with the Tampere conclusion. This has led to the draft regulation now containing the following approach.</p>
<p class="contents">From January 2001 the European police college is set up as a network of national training institutes, a virtual academy. It will function in this form for three years. After that period a decision will be taken on the form in which to continue with the European police college. The Commission continues to take the position, however, that the draft regulation should contain a clear obligation for the European police college to become a fixed institution after having functioned for a few years as a network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Social security in a stronger European economy</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the European Union’s main tasks in the 21st century will doubtless be to ensure that due importance is attached to the social dimension by comparison with the economic and political dimension. Common social policy objectives must be defined and attained in order to ensure that the process of increasing integration and the forthcoming enlargement is supported by the European public. Can the Commission say whether it will take action with a view to the increased harmonisation of social security systems, which still differ widely, and the harmonisation of professional qualifications in all areas?</p>
<p class="contents">Is it correct to assume that the EU’s extremely sparse powers in the fields of social policy and employment will be expanded in the future?</p>

<p class="contents">I will start with the Lisbon Council resolution, which made clear reference to the need to combine the policies of competitiveness and social cohesion, the need to update the social model, to invest in people and to combat social exclusion. Under the Treaties, it is naturally impossible for the Commission to put forward policy on issues relating to social policy But we feel that, in the wake of Lisbon, there is agreement within the Council, and the Council has unanimously decided to cooperate in the field of social policy and to extend the method of open cooperation to issues such as social exclusion and social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I am bound to say that the agenda that was tabled in June, in relation to which there was special cooperation with Parliament and with the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Van Lancker, accurately describes the measures and actions relating to social policy under the Treaty, but it also categorically states that the harmonisation of social polices is not on the cards. Harmonisation is deemed to be impossible. But our objectives can be achieved using methods such as social dialogue, the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund, which has a large budget, mainstreaming, political analysis, research and, finally, legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 1999, the Commission presented a communication entitled ‘A Concerted Strategy for Modernising Social Protection’. This put forward a two-pronged approach. The first is to combat social exclusion and the second concerns future cooperation on issues of social protection and pension systems. To achieve these goals, the Commission is giving priority to the enactment and implementation of social indicators, which are necessary to assess polices, to specify objectives relating to poverty and culture, which will be discussed during the course of the French Presidency, and to reach agreement on axes concerning the viability of pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to express the wish that is dearest to my heart in the form of an additional question: what special measures will the Commission endeavour to take in the future, with a view to working towards the harmonisation of the social security systems, professional qualifications and the social dimension in all areas? It was extremely interesting to hear how matters stand in this respect, and to learn that the trend is more positive than it has been hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe we must convince the people of the European Union that freedom of establishment is not a hollow expression which ultimately applies in full to tourists, rather, they must understand that for people who work, or have worked – firstly in terms of the insurance system and then in terms of the pensions system – freedom of establishment is a reality, and not a hollow expression. I believe we must join forces to this end, in order to try and persuade the Council to frame policy in this area that is more transparent, progressive and forward-looking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, according to our studies, there are such major discrepancies in the structure and organisation of pension and social security systems that it is impossible to talk about harmonising them. Thirdly, regarding the rights of workers as they move from one country to another, there are already two regulations in existence. In July, the Council of Employment Ministers held an in-depth debate on changing the regulations for workers living in one country and working in another. But I must emphasise that these systems are so different that the difficulties in bringing about the harmonisation you propose are virtually insurmountable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This dialogue aims to enable us to come up with new proposals on issues such as the representativeness of these organisations and issues of a procedural nature such as their funding and operation. Within the framework of this dialogue, on 30 March 2000 I met members of the platform of European NGOs and a dialogue took place, which focused on two categories of issues. The first category covered the proposals they put forward, which were invaluable for the social agenda. The second focused on issues concerning the representativeness and the organisation of NGOs in the social arena at a European level, the financial problems they are faced with and the special procedural difficulties they have in obtaining funds. Related issues included the quality and the specifications of the services they offer. I am bound to say that their contribution to this dialogue was extremely significant.</p>

I welcome the fact that NGOs are funded through the exclusion and anti-discrimination action programmes. But I have one specific question: why are only eight or nine NGOs, as far as my information is concerned, funded through these two lines?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, NGOs feel that they are being unfairly denied access to core funding. My information is that they are being pushed into project funding and 18 environmental NGOs, for instance, are receiving from the Commission funding towards their running costs. It occurs to me that two years after the 1998 budget freeze, it might be time now for the Commission to respond to what are very clear needs from the European-based social NGOs for core funding to cover their running costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is the unemployment rate in Greece at present? To what extent is the Greek Government meeting the undertakings it gave regarding the above-mentioned matters?

For the moment, Eurostat does not have statistics on Greece for 1999 and forecasts for 1999 were 10.4%. It is clear therefore that there are no appropriate statistics recording fluctuations in employment, which makes it difficult to assess the policies and measures being implemented. The new action plan for employment and the new measures announced by the Greek government based on this new action plan for employment are a move in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">There are significant undertakings concerning, firstly, the organisation and coordination of statistical services in Greece with those in other European countries and of Eurostat. It is clear that, without a statistical base, it is difficult for us to put in place specific policies. Secondly, there is an undertaking to speed up the reorganisation of public employment and statistical services. This reorganisation will be completed by the end of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not have any information on the number of unemployed who have found work through the various employment programmes in Greece. That is why there is also an undertaking to continuously assess the existing training programmes, together with the Commission, to ensure that those who pass through these programmes are adequately monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say that the tabling of your question coincided with the announcement of recommendations for all Member States. The most fundamental recommendations concerning Greece are, firstly, to make changes to the statistics, the indicators, the studies and the employment services. Secondly, tax disincentives and other disincentives militating against the provision of community subsidies for entering the labour market will be examined in detail. Thirdly, training and the participation of social partners in this process will be promoted. Fourthly, business enterprise will be encouraged and procedures to create new companies will be simplified. Finally, cooperation between social partners will be encouraged and the organisation of labour relations will be brought up to date, at the same time guaranteeing flexibility and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What I would really like to highlight is the following: for many years now, Commissioner, long before you were appointed to your post, I have been trying to find out – even a rough estimate will do – how many people have found work as a result of these employment actions, and I still have not succeeded. What prospects do we have of finding out at some point, albeit from one action if not more generally?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you said we would have the results by the end of 2001. But I think it is totally unacceptable that there can be a debate using these figures, which have been collated throughout the European Union, month by month, category by category, and only the column referring to Greece is empty.

<p class="contents">With specific regard to training, to which you made reference, as you know, in Greece there is the EKEPIS [National Certification Centre for Vocational Training], a certification centre set up with the approval of the Council, which has had very satisfactory results and has made some positive assessments. Over the next period it will complete its certification procedures. In other words, it will certify trainers and programmes, which has hitherto not been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, training must be geared towards the choices made by a country in a service and information society. In other words, the fields covered by training must be linked to the choices made by the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the establishment of centres to promote employment must be completed. So far, 24 have been established. We must have at least 100, according to the plan that was drawn up at national level. These centres must distance themselves from the classical provision of services for the unemployed and must come into line with the models that we already have in the European Union. These models relate to the individualised provision of services for the unemployed. And of course the system of computerised employment cards must be implemented for monitoring to be successful. The action plan for employment for 2000 contains these undertakings. The funding is available for these programmes and my opinion is that, during the 2000-2006 period, training programmes must be geared towards the specific points I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, however, the association in question has heard nothing more.

<p class="contents">I would like to point out that there has been no judgement from the Court of Justice on this specific issue. However, it is true that the Commission classifies this company called Coillte as a state enterprise, because it is owned by the Irish State. It is therefore not entitled to loss of income grants. According to Article 2, paragraph 2, letter b of the Regulation on Forestry, these grants are reserved for farmers and other natural or legal persons under private law. The Commission will therefore refuse to co-finance grants paid out, backdated to 1 August 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of some EUR 4.8 million was paid out in 1997 and 1998. The Irish Government contested this financial rectification in so-called mediation negotiations. The arbitration body is still working on this and has not resolved the issue conclusively as yet. The Commission has taken the stance during these negotiations that, to date the Irish Government has failed to provide any evidence that Coillte should be classified as a private company.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable either to confirm the sum of GBP 6.5 million quoted by Mrs Mckenna, or that of 30.5 million, which obviously relates to future payments. However, the Commission will adopt the same stance it has adopted to date with any future applications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a semi-state company and it is responsible for forestry development. Now it actually used the money it was getting from these interest payments on land that they were purchasing. What is interesting as well as that the chairman, Ray MacSharry is a former European Commissioner for Agriculture and he is still refusing to acknowledge the fact that Coillte is a public entity and that it is not entitled to such payments. At a recent meeting with Coillte I was told that the government is gong to challenge this decision. I believe it is actually a waste of taxpayers' money to challenge it because I think it is quite clear to anybody with an ounce of common sense that they are not entitled to this money. What is really devastating is that they have actually prevented the people who should have got the money from rural depopulation for ensuring that people who did lose income actually got the money and I would like to see the Commission ensure that Coillte get no more money because they were not entitled to it in the first place and that they have to pay it back. They are now saying that the state will have to pay it back which is not acceptable either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What Mrs McKenna has just had to say describes and elucidates precisely the Commission’s position. There can be no question of a State as an entity, and in this case, as the 100% owner of a company, being a drawer of income, and therefore it cannot suffer loss of income either. It is therefore evident that this money must be paid back, and that this company must not receive any fresh funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would point out that this mediation procedure is not equivalent to an arbitration procedure, instead it merely represents the opinion of an institution that was set up by the Community.

This is because a connection has been made between the manner in which the southern States and their products are dealt with, and enlargement. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, you have my word that the proposed reforms in the sectors you mentioned in your answer have absolutely nothing to do with enlargement. Indeed the proposed schedule for enlargement has been drawn up on the basis of the commitments that the Commission entered into, once the Council had enacted the necessary regulations. The reforms result from the need to guarantee the efficacy of CAP instruments, taking into account the full extent of market development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s reform proposals will ultimately serve to implement the European agricultural model in these sectors. It is about securing sustainability in the full sense. We want to bring the economic, social and environmental goals in these sectors into line with each other. Naturally, employment and social progress, particularly in the rural areas in the Mediterranean region, will play a very important part in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the common agricultural policy under Agenda 2000 is, as you know, based on two pillars, and the implementation of the new development plans for rural areas, especially in the Objective I regions has made a significant contribution to the achievement of these goals, I feel it is quite clear what conclusions are to be drawn from this.</p>
<p class="contents">.</p>
<p class="contents">The Financial Perspective, which the European Council agreed on last year in Berlin, strictly distinguishes between the commitments for the 15 Member States and the additional funding earmarked for the candidate countries. Therefore, there is at present no possibility whatsoever of funds earmarked for the 15 EU States being appropriated as expenditure for future Member States, the candidate countries that is. Therefore, as I see it, the concern voiced here is completely groundless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, after all, the point of having transitional arrangements. As such, it will not be possible to answer the question as to when the Member States-to-be will actually receive their full quota of direct payments – as provided for in the common market organisation – until the enlargement negotiations have been concluded.

I would remind the House that the Commission presented Parliament and the Council with a report on the common market organisation of tobacco as early as 1996. The report pointed out that this sector makes a decisive contribution to maintaining the viability of certain regions within the Community, some of which are highly disadvantaged, and where there are few alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of an inquiry at the time into the social and economic consequences of abolishing Community subsidies for tobacco cultivation, the decision was taken not to go down this path. However, this was also because there was evidence to show that subsidising tobacco cultivation has practically no effect on tobacco consumption, and thus on the risk to EU citizens‘ health.</p>
<p class="contents">This led to radical reform of the tobacco sector in 1998. The key aspects of this reform were as follows: firstly, there was an improvement in quality, in particular, tobacco growers switched over to low-nicotine and low-tar varieties. Secondly, research activities have been stepped up, financed by the Community tobacco fund. The appropriations for said fund were doubled. One of the main objectives of this research is to investigate the possibility of switching from tobacco cultivation to alternative activities. Thirdly, with a view to encouraging farmers to go over to other crops, the reform measures also made provision for a mechanism whereby quotas are repurchased from farmers who are willing to give up tobacco cultivation. In this way, these farmers are offered money, as it were, in order to facilitate conversion to other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions laid down in the tobacco market organisation can also be supplemented within the framework of the support measures for rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would just like to say that the Commission will of course assess the reform measures taken. We will provide the European Parliament with a report on the functioning of the amended market organisation by 1 April 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I am keen to acquaint myself with them. Only, irrespective of whether these results are positive or less than positive, as I see it, it is imperative that we – and we must never forget this – convince smokers of their importance, with a view to encouraging them to buy cigarettes that meet these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the tobacco growers’ problem, because they will inevitably grow the kind of tobacco the market demands. Perhaps the best all-round solution is to carry on as I have been doing for the past 15 years – I too was a smoker in the past – and not smoke at all. Then the problem will only exist on a very small scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that tobacco growers in the Member States have different priorities. I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following question, although I have always been, and still am, a non-smoker: does the Commission not think that if tobacco cultivation were to be completely discontinued within the European Union with immediate effect – as called for by a fair number of people – people would just carry on smoking regardless because tobacco products would be imported into the EU? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only difference is that, we are trying, as it were, with the aid of the common market organisation, to produce some of the tobacco that people consume anyway, ourselves, so that we do not have to import everything. In so doing, we are giving some families the opportunity to draw an income from this type of cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced that the health problem, which undoubtedly exists as a result of tobacco consumption, can only be brought under control if we alert consumers as to the effect smoking can have on their health. There will be no decline in tobacco consumption until we have succeeded in driving this message home to consumers. We are deluding ourselves if we think we can control the problem from the supply side. In economic terms, the only way to achieve this is to alter patterns in demand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
