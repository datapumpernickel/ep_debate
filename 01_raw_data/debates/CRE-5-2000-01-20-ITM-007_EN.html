We have stressed again and again in previous sittings that we are keen for the Russian Federation to find a peaceful and political solution to this problem. We really have appealed to the Russian government not to handle this case in a way which violates all the international conventions which it has signed. Unfortunately, we are still unable to report any easing of tension in this war. Far worse! The situation has deteriorated considerably. The situation the civilian population find themselves in in Chechnya has become intolerable. We have no opportunity to take humanitarian action, despite the fact that we have stressed, time and again, and the Russian Federation assured us at the summit in Istanbul, that it would at least be possible, both for observers from the OSCE and humanitarian organisations, to enter Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing remains except to repeat what has been said here in the House and what we wish to stress yet again in this joint motion for a resolution. We want a political solution to this conflict and all parties must be called upon to negotiate such a solution.</p>

I therefore fear that there is little hope of the war ending before Mr Putin’s victory has been confirmed at the elections of 26 March, unless it is by total Russian victory before that time. </p>
<p class="contents">What is important is what happens once the conflict is over and that is hard to predict. It is obvious that the problems in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus, which rank among Russia’s poorest regions, will not be over when the war itself is over. When the Chechens are able to return to their homeland, they will find very little with which they can rebuild their lives. In the past, after the previous war, nothing came of the promised Russian reconstruction and it was difficult to grant foreign aid due to problems on both the Russian and Chechen sides. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also beneficial to look on the bright side, for example, the progress made in the three independent Caucasian states, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. There is no longer a threat of war there and the European institutions should be aware of the different situation there, because it is possible to have it this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament has condemned it and has demanded a ceasefire and political dialogue. Parliament has helped to ensure that humanitarian aid is given and that European Union funds are diverted in this direction. There is no end to the war and to the suffering of the civil population, let alone a permanent solution to the conflict. Has the EU really done everything in its powers? The fact is that the Council and some Member States, including Germany, are extraordinarily reticent in their political, diplomatic and economic reactions to Russian’s persistent refusal to enter into political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States must make it clear that the completely disproportionate use of military power to solve the conflict in Chechnya and the massive infringements of human rights are unacceptable. The European Parliament should fight for the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia to be suspended until Russia agrees to a ceasefire. In addition, we should call on the Member States to impose additional political, diplomatic and economic sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Arms deals and financial support for the warring factions must be stopped immediately. Russia’s sovereign right to protect its territorial integrity and pursue terrorists is undisputed. The question is, which instruments is it entitled to use in order to do so? The dividing line between dialogue and cooperation with Russia and sanctions because of the war is a very fine line. We should not discourage and isolate Russia as we did umpteen times in the last decade. Mutually advantageous cooperation and partnership with Russia are indispensable to the peaceful development of Europe. However, the European Union’s foreign policy will only be credible if it does not shrink from consistent political, diplomatic and economic action in the event of war and massive infringements of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And what is the result of all our demands? We must, as Mr Sakellariou has quite clearly said, keep reiterating our demands. I believe that we must not tire of doing so because, as long as Russia dramatically steps up military force against its own civilian population, we must raise our voices here and say, ‘Enough is enough! We cannot accept this. This violates international human rights. This is not an internal matter for Russia.’</p>
<p class="contents">The list of war crimes is getting longer and longer. Be it the young people arrested from the list of wanted refugees or the long list of rapes which arrived in my office today and which was drawn up by independent human rights observers. This is placing the women of the Islamic community in a very dramatic situation, which is why we must take special care of them. It is the numerous, small individual destinies which call for us to speak out. In the meantime, numerous important drinking water reservoirs have been contaminated by bombarding them with oil.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on all the Members to adopt this motion for a resolution together with the others. We received it after we had jointly debated the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot simply stand by and watch. Unlike Kosovo, the fact is that the 100 000 refugees are in Ingushetia without international aid. This tiny neighbouring republic is collapsing under the strain. I must say that I am surprised that there has been absolutely no reply on the part of the Commission to our demands. I expect a more specific position today on how you are implementing Parliament’s resolutions and the Helsinki resolutions. What you offered yesterday was a complete embarrassment to Parliament.</p>

This brings with it obligations which extend far beyond all kinds of international agreements to protect human rights and far beyond the dictates of martial law. The relations which we have entered into with Russia in the form of treaties also point in the same direction. </p>
<p class="contents">However, the way in which the Russian government is trying to solve its differences with Chechnya flies in the face of these international rules. We can imagine that terrorism and, for example, aggression against Dagestan had to be dealt with. It is a fact that the Chechen authorities cannot be appointed as representatives of a regulated democratic constitutional state overnight. It was, for example, impossible for them to prevent the cruel kidnappings and hostage-takings in their own area, but the means used by Russia is disproportionate and is to be condemned in itself. I refer, in particular, to the bombardments of the people and the treatment of the people who are in the process of leaving that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We are duty-bound to take a stand against this, not out of self-satisfaction because, as someone from a former colonial power, I know about this kind of war and the regret which surfaces say twenty or thirty years later for crimes committed, but for the future of Russia and Chechnya. That is what we care about it, hence this appeal. </p>
<p class="contents">We therefore give our full backing to the resolution. The resolution mainly focuses on humanitarian aspects, the provision of aid, moving the Tacis programme in that direction, diplomatic consultation and possibly consultation based on the OSCE with regard to stability in the Caucasus. </p>
<p class="contents">We, as a European Union, are willing to cooperate with international organisations where Russia requires and expects aid, but we will also have to do everything to continue this type of dialogue with Russia at all costs, even if it is difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, Mr Putin’s soft putsch, which was cleverly timed for the eve of the new millennium, has put him in a very powerful position and has also made him one of the greatest political war profiteers of our time. However, I consider that he should use the power now at his disposal to conclude what General de Gaulle called the <span class="italic">paix des braves</span>, the peace of the brave. What I mean is that he now has the chance to put an end to this murderous war from a position of supreme strength. If he does not manage to do so, his presidential dreams may well drown in blood.</p>
<p class="contents">My second fundamental point is that something else has changed: the mood among the Russian people. Thank God there is criticism. There is criticism from the mothers of the soldiers, there is criticism in the media and by human rights activists. They are still in a minority but it shows that the Russian people still have a conscience and that we must not hold the Russian people responsible for the actions of their leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is this: I consider that in Chechnya itself the people have demonstrated an admirable will to resist, which is why I have a huge problem with point four of our resolution, although I fully understand that we are trying to protect the people of Chechnya from becoming the victims of genocide. I take the view that we, the European Union, must now exert massive political pressure by discussing article 2 of the partnership agreement and by ensuring that the Commission and Council also exert specific pressure, as Parliament has done from the beginning, within the framework of the modest means at its disposal. We, the EU, must speak with one voice and it should not just be up to the European Parliament to speak out. As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, I consider that a number of NGOs which have been providing real help for a long time are putting us to shame. I know of one consignment of baby food which has now got through. Unfortunately, however, the Commission has not managed to build up the appropriate channels in the vicinity and I should really like to know from the Commission why this has not been done. We must, at long last, provide real humanitarian aid against the genocide, because what is taking place in Chechnya is nothing less than genocide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have also done so frequently in the past. So far, we have not yet had any success in the present Russian military conflict against the Chechen people. There is still no peace in this region and, despite the fact that the European Parliament has always made its political views very clear, we have not yet been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that new political opportunities have opened up for us in Russia following the elections to the Duma and the resignation of President Yeltsin. I think that, in addition to considering what sanctions are sensible, the European Parliament must also try to engage in political dialogue with Russia. The composition of the Duma is quite different from any time in the past and that gives us a chance to find political allies, bring this military conflict in Chechnya to an end through political means and finally allow peace to come to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the problem of the Caucasian peoples will be far from resolved once the military conflict has come to an end. We shall then need political dialogue. We shall need political cooperation because this conflict did not come about today. Its roots lie in the history of the Caucasian people in and against Russia and against deportation and occupation by Russia. I think that it would be completely in keeping with the purpose of the European Parliament if we found allies for political dialogue once the military conflict has ended.</p>

If we return, I fear that the Russians will arrest him instantly and effect his disappearance” and “The Russians are not liberators but occupiers. We used to get terrorised by the Islamites. Nowadays, it is the Russian soldiers.” </p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the end of the bloodshed in the Northern Caucasus is not in sight by a long chalk. Without any hesitation, the Russian Prime Minister and Acting President, Vladimir Putin, has impressed on an official delegation of the Council of Europe that the latter should not base its criticism of the Kremlin war on propaganda material. Indeed, this time, Moscow took instant control of the PR aspect of the second Chechen war to break out within the space of a few years.</p>
<p class="contents">To no avail, however. The stories of the immense throng of Chechen refugees speak for themselves. Neither do all Russian politicians allow themselves to be bullied or intimidated by Putin and his circle of advisers. For example, the Presidential candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, who is inclined to reform, quite clearly states that it is criminal to use a war for election purposes. Yavlinsky argues in favour of a dialogue with the Chechen leaders as well as the people.</p>
<p class="contents">This sound line of thinking deserves our support. Indeed, the really threatening alternative is a nigh hopeless guerrilla war. The present, politically stable resolution of the European Parliament aims to avoid this frightening and dangerous scenario at all costs. We will be able to measure its effect anyway when Mr Putin’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ivanov, pays a call on the Council of Europe in Strasbourg next week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This acting president has said he wants political dialogue. He has already met a delegation from the European Council and talked with them for three hours. I propose that a parliamentary delegation should go to Moscow to have political talks with the new leadership.

Therefore, in accordance with the clear position adopted by the Parliament, the Commission feels that it would be a mistake to sever all channels of communication. We should, in particular, be able to discuss with the Russians our extreme disapproval and our serious concerns about the situation in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Helsinki sent a very clear message on the critical situation of the civilian population there and the need for Russia to respect the rules of humanitarian law, particularly in the context of the ultimatum sent to the inhabitants of Grozny, the excessive use of violence and the indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population, the obstacles to the safe and rapid provision of humanitarian aid by the aid agencies and the lack of real political dialogue with the legitimate Chechen authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has not improved since the Helsinki Summit. Although the ultimatum sent to the population of Grozny was not carried out, we are still extremely concerned about the distress of the civilian population and especially of the people trapped in Grozny. The conditions under which humanitarian operations are being carried out remain difficult. No end is in sight as far as the military conflict is concerned in view of the fact that the Russian forces are coming up against quite strong resistance. The acting president, Putin, now speaks of a sustained operation. There are increasing fears that the neighbouring state of Georgia will be affected by the instability.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency and the Commission are actively involved in implementing the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki, that is to say, re-examining the implementation of the common strategy, suspending certain provisions of the cooperation agreement and applying strictly the commercial provisions, envisaging the transfer of TACIS funds to humanitarian aid and reducing TACIS 2000 to a basic programme with limited scope. These matters will be discussed next Monday by the foreign ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs Council. It is clear that we cannot anticipate the results at the moment, but I will ensure that my fellow Commissioner, Mr Chris Patten, is informed about the points raised during this debate so that he can pass them on to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to stress that the Helsinki declaration has already been implemented in the form of specific measures that take particular account of the views of the Parliament, that is, postponement of the signing of the science and technology agreement and the strict application of the commercial provisions, starting with measures in the steel sector against the export tax on non-ferrous scrap. Furthermore, the Commission has decided not to call on the budgetary authority to carry over the appropriations from the food aid programme to Russia that were not used last year.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
