<p>On 11 January 2 Turkish port authority patrol boats illegally entered Greek territorial waters near the islets of Imia, remained there for many hours and obstructed Greek fishermen in the area. This fresh provocation by Turkey openly calls into question the exercise of national sovereignty and sovereign rights by Greece and Greek citizens and constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and international treaties which constitute an inalienable part of the European acquis. At the same time, Turkey is continuing to violate Greek national airspace, thereby creating tension in the Aegean.</p>
<p>Since the European Council decided very recently - in December - to commence accession negotiations with the candidate country Turkey in October 2005, what measures does it intend to take in respect of Turkey to dissuade it from taking similar actions in future and to prevail upon it to live up to its commitments as an applicant country? How does it intend to assess Turkey's continuing provocative behaviour towards Greece, an EU Member State, through the mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the performance of candidate countries?

<p>(FR) The European Council in Helsinki in 1999 had already declared that applicant countries must share the values and objectives of the European Union as set out in the Treaties. In this respect the European Council had insisted on the principle of the peaceful settlement of differences in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and had urged the applicant countries to make every effort to settle any border disputes they might have, and any other issues of a similar kind.</p>
<p>It is in that spirit that the Council has constantly monitored developments in the relations between Turkey and its neighbours.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is aware, on 16 and 17 December 2004, the European Council, emphasising the need for an unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations, noted with satisfaction the improvement in Turkey’s relations with its neighbours. The European Council also welcomed the fact that Turkey was prepared to continue to cooperate with the Member States concerned with a view to settling unresolved border disputes while observing the principle of the peaceful settlement of differences set out in the United Nations Charter. The European Council, in line with its previous conclusions, and in particular those which it adopted on this matter in Helsinki, has taken stock of the situation with regard to the continuing differences and welcomes the exploratory contacts which have taken place with this end in view. On this subject, it has reiterated its view that any unresolved differences which have repercussions on the accession process should if necessary be referred to the International Court of Justice with a view to their settlement. The European Council has emphasised that it should be kept up to date on the progress achieved, which it will examine as and when appropriate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0022"></a>

<p>(FR)The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol on 16 February 2005 will provide an additional effective legal basis for international efforts to combat climate change and should demonstrate the effectiveness of global cooperation involving all countries. The fact that 136 States have so far ratified the Protocol is a clear signal that this binding legal instrument, based on specific quantified commitments to limit or reduce emissions, is perceived by the majority as the only multilateral instrument capable of tackling climate change.</p>
<p>As the Council pointed out in reply to an earlier question put by the honourable Member, the European Union is ready to do everything in its power to persuade the United States to rejoin the multilateral process on climate change, in particular by stepping up scientific and research cooperation and encouraging national policies and measures within the framework of a frank dialogue on future climate change policy.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg Presidency, for its part, raised this issue at the meeting with President Bush on 22 February 2005 and will bring it up again in its bilateral meetings with certain countries that have a key role in curbing climate change. Its efforts are part of an action programme which will be continued during the second half of the year by the future United Kingdom Presidency.</p>
<p>In this context, the Conference of Parties will start examining commitments for the period after 2012 at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period (2008-2012), in practice this will be in November 2005. It is important that all the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on climate change should be involved in these negotiations in order to reach a post-2012 climate regime for the whole planet.</p>
<p>Finally, the Luxembourg Presidency is also counting on the support of European Parliament in continuing to explain the merits of the Protocol and all its potential benefits to the parties that have not yet ratified it, in particular the United States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0027"></a>

<p>(FR) The central importance of education in fighting poverty and aiding development was clearly defined under paragraph 19 of the Millennium Declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000.</p>
<p>The European Union's commitments in terms of promoting education in Africa and other developing regions are based on sectoral budgetary aid that also targets the areas of health, politics, water and sanitation.</p>
<p>The EU's strategy is rooted in the context of the Millennium Development Goals for education and the wider objective of Education For All (EFA), adopted by the international community in Dakar in April 2000.</p>
<p>In its Resolution of May 2002 entitled 'Education and Poverty', the Council stated that a substantial share of the ODA increase resulting from the Monterrey/Barcelona commitments should be used to support social development in developing countries, with special emphasis on improving health and education outcomes, and that this should be followed up accordingly. In the education sector, this should translate into additional support for the MDG/EFA goals to ensure universal primary completion, for boys and girls alike, by 2015.</p>
<p>According to a Commission evaluation, contributions to national programmes and projects in the field of education totalled EUR 258m in 2003, EUR 70m of which went to ACP States. These projects cover primary, vocational and higher education and are all integrated into the national programmes and development strategies of partner countries.</p>
<p>The Council supports the EFA Fast Track Initiative (FTI), in which the Commission plays a key role in coordination at EU Member State level and examines the possibilities of financial support. This initiative aims to help low-income countries with sound policies but insufficient resources to reach the Millennium Development Goal of giving all children a full primary education by 2015.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0029"></a>

<p>(FR) The issue raised by the honourable Member was addressed in Council conclusions adopted in June 2004, which were based on a communication from the Commission. These conclusions recognise that making fishing activities more environmentally friendly will contribute to a more sustainable fishing industry. In its conclusions, the Council emphasised the importance of research in areas such as more environment-friendly types of fishing gear and marine ecosystems. It confirmed its support for pilot projects on discards.</p>
<p>The Council also invited the Commission to take a series of measures in this field, and in particular:</p>
<p>to assess, by the end of 2005, the potential for the provision of financial and non-financial incentives to encourage fishermen to employ more environment-friendly fishing methods;</p>
<p>to propose, after consultation with the relevant Regional Advisory Councils, simplified technical conservation measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea.</p>
<p>As regards the Luxembourg Presidency, environment-friendly technical conservation measures are among the priorities of the joint work programme adopted by that Presidency and the future British Presidency for 2005. The proposal on the Mediterranean is a top priority in this regard, and the Council looks forward with interest to Parliament's opinion on this subject. The Presidency hopes, if possible, to adopt this proposal by the summer.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg Presidency also plans to launch discussions on the proposal on technical conservation measures in the Baltic Sea.

The meeting in London, which will be held on 1 March 2005 at the invitation of the United Kingdom, will give the international community a chance to support the efforts of the Palestinian President. Moreover, the Council has confirmed that the European Union, in collaboration with the other members of the Quartet and Egypt, will support the implementation of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and from certain parts of the Northern West Bank, as being the first stage in the overall process in accordance with the conditions defined by the European Council of March 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0032"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council is closely monitoring the development of the situation in Ukraine. The Council wholeheartedly welcomed the organisation of a second round of presidential elections in Ukraine, conducted on a free and proper basis. To demonstrate the EU's support for the new, democratically elected leaders, the Council and the Commission proposed to the Ukrainian Government that an EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council should be swiftly organised for 21 February with a view to the prompt adoption of an EU-Ukraine action plan, as envisaged at the European Council meeting of 16 and 17 December 2004 in Brussels. In tandem with this initiative, the Council is studying the other possibilities available to it to strengthen cooperation between the EU and Ukraine and support the reforms of the new democratic government in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In this context, the Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the conclusions which it adopted on 31 January 2005, and recalls that, at its meeting of 21 February 2005, the Council adopted conclusions in which it stressed that the European Union is resolved to support Ukraine at this crucial juncture and is prepared to press ahead swiftly on all aspects of the action plan, in particular by envisaging an initial consideration of its implementation from the beginning of 2006, provided that significant progress has been achieved. In addition, the Council agreed to a number of measures designed to strengthen and enrich the action plan in support of a democratic and reform-oriented Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Council would inform the honourable Member that no official application for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union has been submitted to the Council and this matter is, therefore, not currently on the agenda.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0045"></a>

<p>How does the Council, in cooperation with the Member States, propose to tackle this difficult commercial situation on the market in agricultural products which, apart from a possible increase in production, is significantly affected by the implementation of bilateral trade agreements, the pre-accession agreements and, above all, by the period pending implementation of the new CAP in the Member States which is creating uncertainty among producers and the individual sectors concerned?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Council’s attention has indeed been drawn to the risk of disruptions on the markets for certain products in several regions of the Union. The Council has noted the explanations supplied on this issue by the Commission, which is responsible for the management of the markets.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that, in 2003 and 2004, the Council adopted a major reform of the common agricultural policy, which was implemented on 1 January 2005 in most Member States, and which will be implemented with effect from 1 January 2006 in the remaining Member States. All products which are alleged to have been affected by low demand and low prices have in recent years been the subject of the above-mentioned reform. The key element of that reform is the replacement of market and price support by income support for farmers, which will give the market more of a role in guiding production. One of the objectives of the single farm payment system is precisely to give farmers stability of income, particularly in cases where the markets are disrupted.</p>
<p>After such a general reform, while being aware, at this stage, of the need to allow time for the implementation and application of the new policy so as to have the perspective which is essential for a proper assessment of the new mechanisms, the Council will be sure, nevertheless, to examine closely any legislative proposal from the Commission which seeks to put in place any adjustments which may be necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0047"></a>

<p>According to an AFP report, which also appeared in the Turkish daily newspaper 'Hürriyet', there has been an increase in cases of fraud involving vending machines selling cigarettes and confectionery in Germany since the new Turkish lira was introduced on 1 January 2005. Apparently, many vending machines in the Federal Republic of Germany and in other Western European countries cannot differentiate between a coin with a face value of one Turkish lira - which is worth about 55 euro cent - and one with a face value of two euro. This has apparently led to losses running into seven figures. Is the Council aware of this abuse? If so, what action does it plan to take?

<p>(FR) Cases of fraud involving vending machines using Turkish lira have not been brought to the attention of the Council. The Council has not, therefore, adopted a position.</p>
<p>The Council, in collaboration with the Commission, established the legal framework for the introduction of the euro coins, after long consultations with all the parties concerned, including the automatic vending machine sector. The Council even made an adjustment to the specifications for the 50 cent coin before it was brought into circulation, in order to respond to the only explicit request to that effect from the distribution sector.</p>
<p>The Council’s role is restricted to defining the technical specifications for the coins. Protection against this type of fraud is chiefly the responsibility of the national authorities and, as far as possible, of the economic operators themselves.</p>

<p>(FR) The Council has not specifically discussed the destruction that has occurred on the site of Babylon. However, it wishes to stress that it attaches great importance to the conservation of the rich legacy of the world’s cultural heritage.</p>
<p>In its statement of 5 June 2003 on the destruction of cultural goods in Iraq, the Council expressed its deepest concern at the tragic destruction of cultural goods, archaeological sites, and monuments of irreplaceable historical value in Iraq, and the vandalism and looting of the museums and libraries of vital importance not only to Iraq but to the whole world.</p>
<p>In this text, the Council also stressed the need to protect in an efficient way the cultural goods of Iraq and to return the objects illegally removed from museums or archaeological sites, without allowing them to become objects of trade ending up in foreign museums or private collections.</p>
<p>The Council would like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to Council Regulation (EC) No 1210/2003 of 7 July 2003 concerning certain specific restrictions on economic and financial relations with Iraq. This states that it is prohibited to import into the territory of the Community, export from the territory of the Community and to deal in Iraqi cultural property and other items of archaeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific and religious importance if they have been illegally removed from locations in Iraq.</p>
<p>The question of making Babylon a world heritage site, which obviously comes within the remit of UNESCO, has not been referred to the Council but the Council wishes to inform the honourable Member that the European Union supports the initiatives and measures taken by UNESCO and governmental and non-governmental organisations that seek to protect Iraq’s cultural heritage, which is also part of the world’s cultural heritage.</p>
<p>On the general political level, the Council’s objective in respect of Iraq is clear: a safe, stable, unified, prosperous and democratic Iraq that will make a positive contribution to the stability of the region. The Community’s contribution to humanitarian aid and reconstruction in 2003-2004 was of the order of EUR 300 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0052"></a>

<p>The total amount of European aid to the victims of the disaster in south-east Asia stands at € 2 581 billion with an additional € 1 bn from the European Investment Bank (reconstruction loans). European citizens are already raising numerous questions as to whether this aid will be used fully and effectively, particularly in view of the major contribution they have made to direct donations (€ 1 044 bn). The Council of Foreign Ministers meeting on 7 January 2005 stressed the need to go beyond immediate aid and provide a long-term contribution to reconstruction.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, will the Council request the Commission to draw up specific priorities for the aid provided on the basis of existing needs? How does it intend to ensure that these large amounts of aid are properly and effectively managed, particularly in respect of the reconstruction of these regions? What guarantees are there that building and environmental rules and regulations will be respected?

<p>(FR) In its conclusions of 7 January last, the Council explained that ‘aid should go to the most affected regions and the people in greatest need, especially children’ (Conclusions, paragraph 3), and emphasised ‘the responsibility of the national and regional authorities of the countries concerned with regard to the identification of needs’ (Conclusions, paragraph 4). At the same time, it emphasised that ‘reconstruction efforts must be based on the national priorities of the countries concerned and must respect the principle of ownership’ (Conclusions, paragraph 12). At this stage, therefore, the Council does not intend to ask the Commission to submit specific guidelines regarding priorities for the aid provided, other than those just quoted.</p>
<p>As for the monitoring of the amounts granted, the Council intends, as part of the action plan adopted on 31 January last in order to follow up the GAERC Conclusions of 7 January 2005, to adopt measures enabling the effective implementation of the financial commitments to be regularly reviewed on the basis of a Commission report updated in the light of all the information available, including information available via the United Nations. In this context, special attention will be paid to the systems for monitoring financial commitments, which will be improved if necessary.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council explained, in the above-mentioned conclusions, that ‘the international response should make populations and governments less vulnerable and better equipped to cope with possible natural disasters in the future’ (paragraph 18 of the Conclusions of 7 January). By this means, the Council was expressing, implicitly, its desire for reconstruction which would comply with a certain number of parameters as regards habitat and environment, while at the same time wishing to act in such a way as to respect the priorities of the affected countries receiving the aid as well as the principle of ownership. Moreover, in the action plan referred to above, the Council invites the Commission and the Member States to ensure that reconstruction respects the environment and is of such a kind as to prevent or attenuate the effects of such disasters in the future.</p>
<p>The Council pointed to ‘the United Nations’ central role in the coordination and management of assistance to victims’, and stressed ‘the particular importance of cooperation with the OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs)’ (paragraph 5 of the Conclusions of 7 January). The action plan of 31 January emphasises the central role of the United Nations and the need to coordinate EU action, both now and in the future, with the special responsibilities accorded to the United Nations Organisation and the various bodies or organisations which depend on it, such as the OCHA, UNICEF and the WHO. The Council also points to the need to ensure that the efforts of the Commission and of the Member States are coordinated with the development banks (Asian Development Bank and World Bank), and to the advantage of fully involving the NGOs and civil society partners in the process as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0055"></a>

<p>Dawit Isaak is a Swedish citizen who has been imprisoned without trial in Asmara, Eritrea, since 23 September 2001. Dawit Isaak is one of ten journalists working for private-sector media who were arrested in Asmara in September 2001. Mr Isaac has been interned for over three years and the authorities refuse to have his case tried by a court of law. Reportedly, no charges have yet been brought against Mr Isaac for any offence against Eritrean law. His family in Sweden have not received any news of him and do not know whether he is alive. The Eritrean authorities have categorically refused to comment on the case.</p>
<p>In the hope that the Council is aware of the above situation, will it say what practical measures it will take and what pressure it will exert on behalf of Dawit Isaak and other EU citizens who are imprisoned in Eritrea? The previous Presidency promised to tackle these problems but nothing has happened. Is it reasonable for EU citizens to be treated in the manner that Dawit Isaak has been?

<p>(FR) As the Council indicated in its reply to a similar question raised by the honourable Member in October 2004, the Council is closely monitoring the fate of Dawit Isaac and the other journalists who were arrested in September 2001. Since the resumption of a political dialogue with Eritrea in May 2003, the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara have not neglected any opportunity to make clear to the Eritrean authorities their concern over the arbitrary detention of the group of journalists arrested, and over the lack of any information as to their fate, and the lack of any legal framework, rules or procedures for dealing with the cases of the detained individuals in question and of others. As the Council also indicated in October, the Heads of Mission have tried to obtain an assurance that the prisoners are in good health. As part of the political dialogue with the Eritrean authorities, the emphasis will continue to be placed on the fate of the journalists held and on that of other prisoners of conscience. Moreover, the EU Heads of Mission will continue to take initiatives with a view to being able to visit the imprisoned journalists.</p>
<p>Following the request by the Council’s ‘Africa’ Group to the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara, to the effect that the latter should, if possible, raise the question of the fate of the imprisoned journalists in the context of the next political dialogue with the Government of Eritrea, or should take separate action on this issue, the Presidency has written a letter to Mr Isaias, the President of Eritrea, informing him of the EU’s concern over the imprisoned journalists and calling for a transparent and fair trial to be held. The Presidency has also asked the President of Eritrea to authorise the EU Heads of Mission to visit those journalists as well as other political prisoners. Neither the President of Eritrea nor the Eritrean Government has replied to that letter.</p>
<p>The suspending of cooperation with Eritrea would require the opening of consultations with the authorities of that country pursuant to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement and in accordance with the procedures laid down in that Agreement, following a Commission proposal to that effect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0058"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council has constantly reiterated its determination to find a solution to the Cyprus question, and its hope that all Cypriots will soon be able to be reunited as citizens of a united island of Cyprus within the European Union. Against this background the Council has always supported – and will continue to support – all the efforts being made, particularly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, towards finding an overall solution to the problem. Nevertheless, the Council recognises that the crucial contribution towards this goal must come from a gradual rapprochement between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. At the same time it should be borne in mind that the Cyprus question is still on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>The European Union has made a contribution, by adopting various measures to facilitate a rapprochement between the communities, given that the European Union’s common denominator is still the Conclusions of the Council of 26 April 2004, which recommend measures intended to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community by encouraging economic development, and to promote the reunification of the island. The implementation of these conclusions is to some extent still being discussed within the Council’s preparatory bodies, while some of them (the rules concerning the Green Line) have already been adopted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0062"></a>

<p>(FR) In its conclusions on Colombia, adopted in December 2004, the Council expressed the European Union’s readiness to pursue an effective and result-oriented engagement. A more formal EU involvement could take place through timely political endorsement for the ongoing peace process once the Colombian Government has set out a comprehensive legal framework. In this respect the Council underlined that the European Union would have great difficulty in endorsing the peace talks so long as the illegal armed groups have not ceased hostilities. Taking a gradual approach linked to developments on the ground, the Council also expressed its readiness to provide concrete and adequate financial support for the outcome of such talks once a comprehensive strategy has been defined for the assembly, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration in society of the members of the illegal armed groups.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the fact that, in the statement made in Cartagena on 3 February 2005, the Colombian Government and the donors have revived the London Declaration of 10 June 2003. The ambitious and precise London undertakings thus remain valid as guidelines for the peace process and as a foundation for possibly increased donor commitment. The statement described a certain degree of progress by the Colombian Government and stressed the need for a legal framework to put into effect the principles of truth, justice and reparation. Such a framework is essential for devising a realistic peaceful long-term solution based on respect for democratic principles and victims’ rights. In this respect the Presidency clearly confirmed in Cartagena that the formulation of an international cooperation strategy must be clearly guided by these principles.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0078"></a>

<p>(FR) The EU takes a natural interest in Georgia, which is close to its borders, and is focusing more on the region as well. The South Caucasus was included in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU co-hosted a major donor-conference for Georgia and has appointed a Special Representative for this sub-region. The EU also has an ESDP rule of law mission operating in Georgia, EUJUST Themis, which is further evidence of EU support to Georgia. In pursuance of the European Security Strategy, the EU takes a strong and active interest in the problems of the South Caucasus. With the presentation of country reports by the Commission and the Secretary-General/High Representative, the Council will decide on how to go forward with the ENP. ENP will play a major role in the EU-South Caucasus relations in the coming years.</p>
<p>The EU has consistently maintained the view that the Border Monitoring Operation (BMO) in Georgia should be continued. The mission has been extremely important and has played an important role in strengthening confidence-building and conflict prevention.</p>
<p>The renewal of the BMO mandate under the OSCE umbrella still remains the primary objective. The EU is currently considering options as how an international presence on the border could be ensured in the event that the OSCE route remains blocked. Possible options could include an independent EU-led monitoring operation, within the framework of the ESDP; the EU could also consider providing more support and training to Georgia's border guards. Currently consultations are being held with the Georgian and Russian authorities. A training mission of the OSCE for the border guards could also help to ensure that valuable experience is shared and, that the OSCE involvement in this matter is continued.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0080"></a>

<p>The Council intends shortly to hold its second reading of the patent directive, which is giving rise to much controversy in a large number of circles and Member States (e.g. a fact borne out in Poland, for example, by even the most recent statements made by representatives of the Polish government). The Commission representative, Commissioner Potocnik, is unwilling to make an official statement on this subject.</p>

<p>(FR) The reason why the Council has not yet adopted a joint position on this directive was initially a procedural one, that is, the fact that the Council’s lawyer-linguists had not yet completed their legal examination of the wording of the common position. The drafting of the text could not begin until the wording of the political agreement was available in all the official languages of the Union, including those of the new Member States.</p>
<p>Moreover, following the recent decision by the EP’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has since been confirmed by the Conference of Presidents, to ask the European Commission to resubmit this proposed directive to the European Parliament, the Council Presidency thought it advisable to wait for the Commission’s response to Parliament’s request before placing the formal adoption of the common position on the Council agenda.</p>
<p>Once the response is known, the common position will be adopted and notified to the European Parliament, accompanied by the Council’s reasons for adopting it, in accordance with the Treaty. The Council’s explanation of its reasons for adopting a common position forms the appropriate framework enabling the Council to explain its position in the light of the various amendments proposed by the European Parliament. Consequently I do not believe it is advisable to comment on individual amendments today. I am convinced that the European Parliament will make full use of the second reading to reach a clearer opinion on the content of the Council’s common position.</p>
<p>I must emphasise, however, that the Council does not share the very negative opinion which honourable Members hold regarding its political agreement. The Council’s objective, in fact, is to codify existing legal practice throughout the European Union, while retaining a balance between the need to encourage innovation throughout the electronics industry and the information and communications technology industry on the one hand, and the taking into consideration of all software operators, especially SMEs and individuals, on the other. Having said that, the Council’s position would also have to develop in the light of the work carried out within Parliament.</p>
<p>As for the remarks made on the subject of the attitude allegedly adopted by certain delegations, both during and after the Council discussions of 18 May 2004, I would remind honourable Members that the Council refrains from commenting on considerations of this kind.</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot ignore the fact that the fear of creating an institutional precedent of a kind which would considerably delay the taking of a decision in the Community context explains, to some extent, the Council’s position expressed here today.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0082"></a>

<p>(FR)The Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the conclusions from November, when a very pertinent report was adopted on the issue of the role of education systems in promoting European values. This report entitled ‘Education and citizenship: report on the broader role of education and its cultural aspects’, which responded to a request from the Thessaloniki European Council in March 2003, was then passed on to the European Council in December 2005. Although the content of education systems is the responsibility of the Member States, as clearly indicated in the Treaty, the Member States have a great deal to learn from each other, by using the open method of coordination. The process envisaged in the ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme (the educational side of the Lisbon strategy) is an excellent way of doing so. This report gives an overview of the priority measures in the field of citizenship education and confirms active citizenship as a specific objective of Community programmes in the fields of education and training.</p>
<p>The Council notes that the Council of Europe has designated 2005 ‘The European Year of Citizenship’ and will follow this event with a great deal of interest. In this first six-month period, the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union has organised a ‘Forum for a Multicultural Europe’ (Mersch, 22-29 January), the aim of which was to enable young secondary school pupils from every country in the EU to discuss and work on the theme ‘We are Europe!’ With the participation of more than 250 schools and 23 Member States, the forum was highly successful. The Presidency’s slogan ‘Let’s learn more languages to speak the same language’ demonstrates Luxembourg’s well-known commitment to multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Mobility, multilingualism and creating a climate for better mutual understanding are the main themes of several conferences taking place in Luxembourg as part of the Luxembourg Presidency. The launch of Europass (31 January – 1 February) and the symposium on multilingualism in schools ‘the development of education in Europe – multilingualism opens up new possibilities’ (Luxembourg, 9-11 March) are other occasions when this aspect of the Luxembourg Presidency’s programme is being implemented.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0098"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council shares the honourable Member’s view that the re-launch of direct discussions between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which was visible at the Sharm El Sheikh summit on 8 February, is a very positive development.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures referred to by the honourable Member in his question, the Council will carry out the short-term action plan adopted by the European Council in November regarding security, economic reform and the elections. The meeting in London, which will be held on 1 March 2005 at the invitation of the United Kingdom, will give the international community an opportunity to support the efforts of the Palestinian President. The Council has also re-affirmed that the European Union will, in cooperation with the other members of the quartet and Egypt, support the implementation of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank as a first stage in the overall process, in accordance with the conditions laid down by the European Council in March 2004.</p>
<p>With regard to the security barrier to which the honourable Member referred, at its sitting on 12 July 2004, the Council stated, in response to the advisory opinion, that while the EU recognised Israel’s right to protect its citizens from attack, it has repeatedly asked it to halt construction of the barrier in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem and the surrounding area, and to reconsider the plan.

<p>The European Union's policy which involves the restructuring of air transport has dealt a severe blow to the labour, wage and social rights of workers and caused the bankruptcy of airlines in the Member States (Sabena, Swissair, etc.). The Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice has demanded the restitution, as state aid for the 1998-2002 period, of sums which, according to the Greek government, were paid to offset liabilities of the Greek State towards Olympic Airways. The former commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, has herself recognised the Greek State's increased liabilities in respect of Olympic Airways. It is clear that matter was referred to the European Court of Justice in order to justify the financial depreciation of Olympic Airways and the imminent sell-out of the company, the blow to wage and labour rights and the dismissal of thousands of employees of Olympic Airways.</p>

<p>(FR) As the honourable Member points out, the Commission is well aware of the strategic importance of air transport for the Union and the Member States.</p>
<p>This is why it has accompanied the gradual unification of the European market, which goes back to the early 1990s, with a generally favourable attitude towards the restructuring of traditional operators, and at the same time towards the establishment of fair competition rules.</p>
<p>This policy has been the same across the Union.</p>
<p>It has enabled the establishment of a competitive and innovative European industry.</p>
<p>It has also enabled new, successful operators to emerge, including in Greece.</p>
<p>The Commission did not act differently with regard to Greece or Olympic Airways.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the discussion that we are now holding stems from two positive decisions that the Commission took (regarding State aid) in favour of Olympic Airways in 1996 and later in 1998.</p>
<p>Everything that followed was only intended to ensure that these two initial positive decisions by the Commission were complied with, which should have allowed Olympic Airways to be restructured and ensure that it was economically viable without further State aid (one time, last time).</p>
<p>This was the aim of the Commission’s referral to the Court in October 2003, asking for the decision made one year previously (2002) to be complied with in order to ensure that the decisions made in 1996 and 1998 were complied with (the Commission had stated in 2002 that the conditions for the 1996 and 1998 decisions had not been complied with, and that new illegal aid had been paid).</p>
<p>This was also the aim of the enquiry that the Commission began in March 2004 to ensure that Olympic did not benefit from further illegal advantages granted since then.</p>
<p>While ensuring that competition rules are complied with in air transport, the Commission encourages the development of regional air transport. We demonstrated this a few days ago when we proposed guidelines for financing airports and launching new lines from regional airports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0089"></a>

<p>(EN) The current situation of the EU pigmeat sector is positive. Without any unforeseeable circumstances it is likely to remain that way.</p>
<p>The Community average market price for pig carcases is currently rather good and experts foresee stable and firm market prices for the first six months of 2005. This positive picture is based on the fact that the pigmeat production in the EU will go down by 1.6% in the first half of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004; also for Poland, a decrease of production is foreseen. Moreover, exports from EU may remain at a high level in the first months of 2005 and will have a positive influence on the EU balance sheet for pigmeat.</p>
<p>Even if the introduction of support measures such as export refunds for carcases and cuts or aid for private storage are possible under the pigmeat regime, no such measures have been applied since March 2004 due to favourable market conditions. Lower costs for compound feed since summer 2004 have contributed to this situation.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to follow very closely the development of the market in the coming weeks.

<p>(EN) Due to a very significant increase of milk production on the Azores in the nineties, the total of their individual reference quantities in 1999/2000 was exceeded by about 80 000 tonnes. This led to Portugal exceeding its national reference quantities for the first time and Portuguese producers therefore became liable for supplementary levy.</p>
<p>At the request of Portugal and in order to enable the milk sector being restructured, the Council decided to allow a special franchise of 73 000 tonnes to be used by Azorean producers, who exceeded their historical reference. No levy therefore was paid by Portugal in 1999/2000.</p>
<p>In 2002/2003 Portugal exceeded its national reference including the above franchise and Portuguese producers were therefore liable for the corresponding levy.</p>
<p>At this time it became apparent that Portugal may have applied the franchise in a manner which allowed it to indirectly benefit continental producers</p>
<p>Discussions between the Portuguese authorities and Commission services have taken place on how to correctly apply the franchise in the context of reallocation of unused quantities. A method was agreed that avoids franchise quantities being used directly or indirectly on the continent.</p>
<p>In the context of the Clearance of Accounts procedure the Commission services have requested the Portuguese authorities to review their supplementary levy calculations for the period 2002/2003 in light of the method. Depending on the outcome of this review the Portuguese authorities will have to fix the extent to which Azorean producers have contributed to the excess of the national reference quantity and if it is proved that a supplementary levy was paid in excess, a reimbursement should be done according to national rules.</p>
<p>The Commission does take all indications of unequal treatment seriously and the honourable Member can be assured that the issue about the possible over and underpayment of levy by producers will be addressed during the clearance of accounts procedure which is currently underway. The Commission will pay attention as well to supplementary levy wrongly charged to some Azorean producers as to no payment of supplementary levy related to producers in overshot.</p>
<p>With regard to the honourable Member’s first question, in relation with the previous discussions there are currently no infringement proceedings either underway or in preparation with regard to Portugal’s application of the milk quota regime.</p>

<p>(EN) Our key objective for this Round has been and remains to respect the Doha Mandate, without calling into question our Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) Reform. This objective has been achieved with the Agreed Framework, which is the basis for developing modalities to be agreed in Hong Kong. The Commission has already made it clear to its partners in the Word Trade Organisation (WTO) that since Agenda 2000, the EU has already undergone important reforms of its farm policy, moving support from product to producer. The latest 2003 reform is going even further in the sense wished by the entire WTO Membership and it is now for other WTO Members to match our level of ambition.</p>
<p>Regarding the honourable Member’s question about any analysis on the consequences of a WTO agreement, obviously it is too soon to deliver a definitive analysis on the consequences of the WTO talks before reduction formulae and levels of reduction have been agreed. However, the honourable Member can be ensured that Commission’s services are working on a daily basis on analysis and scenarii to design and adapt our negotiating position, based on assumptions and depending on the evolution of the discussions in Geneva.</p>
<p>It is the EC objective to reach agreement on detailed modalities next year in Hong-Kong. Bearing in mind the comprehensive nature of the Doha Agenda, it is important that the modalities cover all sectors and that, as regards agriculture, the agreement in Hong Kong should be balanced between the different pillars and between trade and non trade issues. The Commission is fully aware of the importance of the WTO agriculture negotiations in the Doha Development Agenda. The negotiations are at the top of its priorities. The Commission therefore intends to play an active role both in the EU and internationally to defend and promote the EU position. During these negotiations, it has been and will continue its collaboration with both the Council and the Parliament through the normal channels.</p>
<p>The on-going technical discussion which have been taken place in Geneva since the summer break under the responsibility of Tim Groser, Chair of the agricultural negotiations, have proved to be very useful. However, there are issues of a highly political nature which will have to be moved to a higher level. Political involvement has now become crucial since the Commission believes that to reach modalities in Hong Kong it is necessary to get substantial work done by the summer break.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0094"></a>

<p>In the accession negotiations, the production quotas for starch granted to Poland for 2004-2005 amounted to 145 000 tonnes. This is significantly lower than the production capacity of the processing plants in Poland, while the demand for starch, which in 2003 amounted to almost 200 000 tonnes, is showing a clearly increasing trend. Increasing the production quotas by 30 000 tonnes, that is to a total level of almost 180 000 tonnes, would result in the creation of a great number of jobs and would improve the financial situation of farmers producing starch potatoes. At the same time, in view of the non-utilisation of production quotas in many EU States (from 1998 to 2004, starch production in the EU 15 was on average 7% lower than the production limits in force), raising the production limits for Poland would not involve exceeding Community production quotas or additional budget expenditure.

<p>(EN) Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch clearly states that the quota is allocated to each Member State according to starch production in a certain reference period, taking irreversible investments into account which were made before a certain date. There is no provision for an increase in the allocated quota to take a later increase in processing capacity into account. The quotas for the New Member States were negotiated at the Copenhagen Summit in 2002 and agreed on by the candidate countries and the EU-15 Member States.

<p>The EU has undergone enlargement and the EU institutions have adopted a Constitution. It is an appropriate time for a declaration of the principles on which the EU is based: equality of conditions for all, rejection of all kinds of discrimination etc.</p>
<p>However, the reality is quite different. For example, on the River Oder, which forms the border between old and new Member States, there is multiple discrimination against farmers from the new Member States. Here, under identical soil and climate conditions, farmers on one side of the river receive over EUR 400 per hectare in support from EU funds, while farmers on the other side of the river receive barely EUR 50 per hectare. It appears that discrimination in the new Member States will continue even after 2013 and will reach approximately 50%.

<p>(EN) The Commission has carefully examined the situation in the New Member States before accession and considered various possibilities how to approach problem of direct payments. It is aware of the fact, that New Member States have limited experience with Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) administration and also short time between conclusion of accession negotiations and the accession itself was difficult to set-up necessary control systems for EU schemes. Therefore farmers in New Member States have the option to use simplified support scheme and they do not have to meet all the obligations required for EU 15 counterparts. For instance they do not have to comply immediately with the same environmental, animal welfare and other rules (cross-compliance) as farmers in EU-15 in order to qualify for direct payments. This is considerable administrative simplification as reaction to their limited administrative capacity.</p>
<p>The major need for the farmers in the New Member States is need of investment into agricultural holdings in order to modernise their structure and comply with EU production standards. This can only be reached by tailor-made rural development programmes and not by full direct payments which would have negative impact on price disparities between various sectors in the New Member States. Furthermore, the latest data from Eurostat indicate that in 2004 the real agricultural income per worker in the New Member States was on average increased of 53.8% compare to 2003. This strong growth is mainly due to an increase of 244% in subsidies. Moreover, national co-financing of direct payments enables to reach EU level in 2010 and under certain conditions on product bases the EU level can be reached already from the date of accession.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0103"></a>

<p>UNICEF in Sri Lanka for actions including the distribution of children hygiene kits, clothes and safe water as well as medicine to 5 000 households, including children</p>
<p>The World Food Program for food distribution in Sri Lanka, including targeted supplementary distributions for malnourished children under five years old.</p>
<p>The Danish Red Cross for psychosocial support actions in Sri Lanka including specific activities (games and sharing of experiences) and counselling for children.</p>
<p>UNICEF for actions in the Maldives including the provision of water tanks for 120 schools and the provision of cold rooms for vaccines for 50 000 children in hospitals.</p>
<p>On 9 February 2005, the Commission adopted a humanitarian aid decision of € 80 million covering the countries affected by the tsunami in South and South East Asia. These funds will be allocated for actions that will benefit children, among other target groups, in the sectors of food aid, shelter, primary health care, water and sanitation, psychosocial care and livelihood support.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, the European Humanitarian Aid Office’s (ECHO) intervention strategy includes child sensitive components with partners that are practically omnipresent in the country. Most of the ECHO partners are working directly with beneficiary households and are therefore aware of needs at the family unit level including specific needs of children. Providing assistance in the form of shelter, food, livelihood activities and so forth at the family level provides an essential protection mechanism for the whole family unit which in turn also responds to the needs of children.</p>
<p>In India, ECHO has identified psycho-social care as one of the priority sectors of intervention. This support will focus specifically on children who have been orphaned, lost one parent, sibling or other family members and friends, or made homeless and displaced, or otherwise traumatised. ECHO will work only with partners who were already established in India prior to the tsunami, and thus have a solid understanding of the local context. ECHO partners will in turn develop partnerships with existing structures (such as NIMHANS: National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences) and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This will help to ensure that interventions in response to psycho-social needs are appropriately formulated, as well as contributing to capacity building of local NGOs.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, interventions will take place at the household level, even if the households are temporarily residing in camps. ECHO will not work with state or private orphanages, and will strive to ensure that children are not removed from their immediate or extended family.</p>
<p>Projects focused on livelihoods recovery do not specifically target children, but will benefit the whole family, and will promote a swift return to a normal and stable livelihood and thus home environment. Projects focused on water-sanitation will contribute to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of water-borne diseases, and will all contain a public and personal health and hygiene awareness campaign, with a specific child-centred component.</p>
<p>With regard to the fight against child sex tourism EU legislation has been adopted through the Council Framework Decision of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. In particular, Member States shall criminalise sexual engagement with children carried out abroad by own nationals (Art. 8 par. 1b). On the other hand, the Framework Decision allows Member States to deviate from this rule (Art 8 par. 2). If they deviate they have to inform the Council Secretariat and the Commission. The deviation rule is difficult to understand and could be questioned even before the deadline for implementation (January 2006). Therefore, the Commission will examine whether or not Member States deviated (or intend to do so) from the requirement in the Framework Decision to establish their jurisdiction for sexual offences committed abroad by their own nationals (Art. 8 par.1b) and, if so, for what reasons. In any case, the Commission will reiterate the importance of establishing jurisdiction in accordance with Article 8 par. 1b of the Framework Decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0015"></a>

<p>(EN) In December 2004 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations.<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> This Regulation significantly improves the present situation on animal welfare conditions during transport in many respects. The Commission, however, regrets that the Council did not consider going as far as the Commission proposal on the issues of restrictions of travel time and transport density.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the text of the Regulation does not deprive the Commission of the right to come back on important issues related to sensitive topics. Namely, the text of the Regulation (art. 32) provides for the Commission to report back to the Council on the issue of travelling times and loading densities, and possibly to accompany its report by appropriate legislative proposals concerning journey times on the basis of the experience acquired from the application of the new rules. This process can be initiated by the Commission at any time and no later than January 2011. In this context, the Commission believes that all possibilities should be exploited to go in the direction of reinforcing the provisions on travelling time. The Member of the Commission responsible for Public Health and Consumer Protection has publicly stated his intention to revisit this issue preferably before the end of the mandate of the current European Parliament.</p>
<p>On this issue, in addition, the Commission intends to avail itself of its power of initiative also beyond the above-described reporting exercise foreseen in the Regulation. To this end, it intends to carefully analyse any possible evolution of the prevailing political conditions. The Commission will therefore continue to monitor the situation and, depending on the results, it is prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future, should the welfare conditions of animals need further improvements. It explicitly retained this right when giving its consent to the compromise draft of the Regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The political support given by the Commission to the controversial project to build a new gas pipeline network from the Russian Federation along the floor of the Baltic Sea (known as the Northern European gas pipeline) is a matter for concern. The Commission is giving additional backing to the project by funding a feasibility study, which constitutes unequivocal support for the private interests of monopolistic gas companies.</p>
<p>The Commission's position is very surprising, given that the estimated cost of this investment is 5.7 billion dollars, that is, two and a half times more than that of an alternative project based on the building of a second Yamal pipeline (around 2.2 billion dollars). In addition, the maintenance and transport costs for the Northern European pipeline will be three times greater.</p>
<p>Confirmation that this is the case can be found in the records of the EU-Russian Federation Energy Dialogue which show that the Commission takes absolutely no account of the cheaper and easier option of the building of the Yamal pipeline project.

<p>(EN) As part of its humanitarian aid, the Commission has taken the following initiatives to make sure that its humanitarian aid following the tsunami reaches the whole country, including the north and east areas controlled by the LTTE.</p>
<p>The primary emergency decision of € 3 million, approved the very same day of the disaster, targeted the most-affected countries, including Sri Lanka. This support allowed the International Federation of the Red Cross, through the actions of the Sri Lankan National Society’s volunteers island wide, to distribute essential relief items such emergency shelter, non-food items, family kits, emergency medical kits, basic building and repair items.</p>
<p>Also the Commission adopted a € 10 million emergency decision for Sri Lanka and the Maldives on 30 December 2004. Out of this amount, € 8.26 million have been contracted to nine humanitarian aid partners active in Sri Lanka and all operations, mainly focusing on water and sanitation, food aid and health, are well underway since the very first days following the disaster.</p>
<p>These organisations were already working in the conflict-affected areas before the tsunami hit the coastal belt of Sri Lanka, and are indeed targeting their support to tsunami victims living in the north and the east, notably in LTTE-controlled areas. Some of these operations are implemented directly by our partners, some others, like the ones under the responsibility of the United Nations agencies, are managed with the support of local organisations or authorities.</p>
<p>In detail, the Commission provides funds, among others, to the following:</p>
<p>UNICEF for actions including the distribution of children hygiene kits, clothes and safe water as well as medicine to 5 000 households, including children</p>
<p>The World Food Program for food distribution, including targeted supplementary distributions for malnourished children under five years old.</p>
<p>The Danish Red Cross for psychosocial support actions including specific activities (games and sharing of experiences) and counselling for children.</p>
<p>ZOA for tracing and transporting bodies; transporting survivors to hospital; providing shelter, food, non food relief items, water and sanitation.</p>
<p>Oxfam for the installation and provision of safe drinking water, disinfection of polluted water sources and containers; for ensuring access to safe excreta disposal facilities through construction of temporary latrines.</p>
<p>Action Contre la Faim (ACF) for the victims to accede to safe drinking water through the provision of regular water trucking, decontamination of 220 wells; to live in a decent sanitation environment through the construction of emergency latrines in 14 camps and the distribution of hygiene kits.</p>
<p>On 9 February 2005, the Commission approved an additional € 80 million package for relief and small scale rehabilitation activities in the most affected countries, including Sri Lanka for which an indicative amount of € 20 million has been earmarked. This package foresees, among other actions, small-scale livelihood recovery projects such as boat repairs and supply of fishing gear to fishermen communities, as well as psychosocial care for traumatised victims, food aid, shelter and housing repair.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s humanitarian aid policy, which is need-based driven, will continue to focus primarily on the North and the East, but will also consider interventions islandwide through our support to United Nations agencies.</p>
<p>The main reason for this geographical targeting is need-based driven, following the humanitarian aid principles of neutrality and impartiality, since it is estimated that the north and the East sustained about 60% of the damages.</p>
<p>It is also based on our humanitarian partners’ presence and expertise in this region. Since the ceasefire of February 2002, the Commission, in the framework of its humanitarian aid policy to focus on ‘forgotten crises’, has been very active to respond to the needs of the internally displaced people returning to their areas of origin or living in the so-called ‘welfare centres’. Between 2002 and 2004, more than € 23 million have been allocated to this population through nearly twenty partners.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0024"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not share the view that the Internal Market poses a threat to workers and consumers. The aim of the Internal Market is to contribute to Europe’s quality of life and standard of living – now and in the future. In accordance with successive European treaties, market opening has gone hand in hand with ensuring high levels of consumer and worker protection. By removing obstacles to trade and investment within EU25, the Internal Market has already delivered many tangible benefits to Europe's consumers and workers.</p>
<p>Consumers enjoy a wider choice of high-quality products at more competitive prices. In addition, measures have been taken to protect and inform consumers better. The position of consumers within the Internal Market will be further strengthened with the adoption and implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. This measure will provide consumers with the same protections against unfair business practices irrespective of whether they buy locally, from a web site or when travelling abroad. Moreover, effective enforcement of consumer rights has been strengthened with the adoption of the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation in October 2004<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The aim of this Regulation is to establish a network of national enforcement authorities and enable them to take effective action against rogue traders who abuse the freedom of the Internal Market to deceive consumers.</p>
<p>All this is recognition of the fact that consumer and Internal Market policies are inextricably linked. Consumers gain from competitive markets. At the same time, no market can work well without confident consumers.</p>
<p>The results of Internal Market policies for workers have also been positive. Evidence shows that, during the first decade of the Internal Market, at least 2.5 million additional jobs have been created. The Internal Market is capable of contributing even more to growth and jobs, as, for example, the recent Kok Report on revitalising the Lisbon Strategy points out. Internal Market freedoms allow workers to find employment in other Member States and enjoy full social security benefits. Where relevant, professional qualifications obtained in one Member State must be recognised in all other Member States. Furthermore, Internal Market policies have been accompanied by strong worker protections. For example, EU law provides for high levels of protection concerning working time rules, the posting of workers, rules on health and safety at the work place and rules against discrimination. EU law also enhances worker consultation and representation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member draws attention to high mobile phone charges and an absence of real competition in the mobile market in Ireland, as illustrated by the profit margins of certain operators referred to in his question.</p>
<p>The EU e-communications regulatory framework is based on the premise that effective competition should drive down prices, to the benefit of users and consumers. National regulatory authorities (NRAs) have the task of analysing the state of competition in relevant markets and imposing appropriate ex ante regulation if they find that competition is not effective.</p>
<p>In the case of Ireland, the NRA (ComReg) has already carried out an analysis of the market most pertinent to the honourable Member’s question, the wholesale market for mobile access and call origination. ComReg concluded that Vodafone and O2 are jointly dominant in this market, a finding which the Commission has supported in the notification procedure provided for in the Framework Directive. ComReg intends to impose on these undertakings an obligation to give mobile virtual network operators (‘MVNOs’) access to their networks, with the aim of increasing competition in the retail mobile market in Ireland and thereby addressing the relatively high retail prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, under the e-communications regulatory framework, all NRAs, including ComReg, are due to carry out their analyses of the wholesale national market for international roaming on public mobile networks. In this regard questionnaires have been sent on a co-ordinated basis by many NRAs within the framework of the European Regulators Group (ERG) to gather information, inter alia, on the tariffs charged between operators for wholesale international roaming services. Based on their market analysis, NRAs will have to determine whether there is effective competition in each market and, if not, envisage appropriate remedies, in accordance with EU law.</p>
<p>In addition, as the honourable Member has pointed out, the Commission recently initiated an investigation into roaming charges. In that context, the Commission has initiated proceedings under Article 82 of the EC Treaty against the Vodafone Group, the mmO2 Group and the T-Mobile Group as regards the high roaming charges applied in the United Kingdom (Vodafone, O2) or Germany (Vodafone, T-Mobile).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0034"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is pleased to be given the opportunity to present the latest steps taken to address the problem of accidental catch of dolphins and porpoises in fisheries</p>
<p>The Commission would first recall the strong support given by the Parliament on 10 February 2004 when approving Mr Kindermann’s report on the Commission proposal on a set of measures to protect cetaceans against by-catch. This contributed to the fast adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 specifically dedicated to the incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Further to other Commission proposals aimed at reducing fishing effort and which will also indirectly benefit to cetaceans, this Regulation provides for a phasing out of driftnets and a total ban by 1 January 2008 in the Baltic Sea to benefit the critically endangered population of Baltic harbour porpoise. Significant reduction of bycatch of cetaceans, especially porpoises, is also expected through the use of acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) that are mandatory in a number of gillnet fisheries since 1<span class="sup">st</span> January 2005. Finally, this regulation makes compulsory the monitoring of by-catches of cetaceans through on-board observer schemes in a number of fisheries using pelagic trawls or gillnets that were considered by scientists as presenting a high risk. These extensive monitoring programmes also begin this year.</p>
<p>In parallel to these recent new legal measures, the Commission continues to support scientific studies and research to conserve cetaceans. Such projects include in particular the so-called ‘NECESSITY’ research project, which began in 2004, with the aim of developing mitigation measures for bycatch of cetacean in pelagic trawl fisheries, as well as the so-called ‘SCANS 2’ project, co financed under LIFE - the financial instrument for the Environment- which aims at updating the scientific estimates of small cetacean abundance in European Atlantic waters.</p>
<p>All these studies, research and conservation projects, in combination with data on bycatch of cetaceans in a large number of fisheries that will be made available through the mandatory observer programme to which it has just been referred, are designed to provide elements for more targeted and effective management measures to limit the effects of fishing on cetaceans. The Commission will continue working towards solutions with regard to the incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries in close cooperation with all interested parties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>a comprehensive legal framework which is compatible with Colombia's international commitments and take into account the right of the victims to truth, justice and reparation.

By 9 February 2005, € 103 million out of the announced € 123 million humanitarian funding had already been committed. The funds support a wide variety of humanitarian activities, both in response to the United Nations’ appeal, and as additional assistance provided through other humanitarian organisations</p>
<p>The Commission has stringent procedures in place to ensure that humanitarian funds are effectively and properly spent in relieving the suffering of crisis victims. From the outset ECHO experts undertake needs assessments in the stricken areas to ensure that EU support goes to where it is most needed. The implementation of humanitarian projects funded by the Commission is also closely monitored by the experts, as well as being subject to rigorous audit and evaluation procedures.</p>
<p>The Commission has also pledged up to € 350 million for the medium and longer term reconstruction/rehabilitation phase. The priority areas and disbursement mechanisms for this money will be decided in consultation with the affected countries and other donors. The countries in South-East Asia are currently carrying out needs assessments for the rehabilitation/reconstruction, together with the World Bank.</p>
<p>Commission officials are closely following the work on the needs assessments, and are in contact with the World Bank on what management structures can be set up for the rehabilitation/reconstruction programmes. The Commission has experience of various structures from its reconstruction/rehabilitation programmes in other countries, like in Afghanistan and East Timor. One option is, for example, to contribute to World Bank managed Trust Funds, to which many different donors can also contribute. The precise rules for the workings of such structures, including auditing, procurement, and adaptation to the local environment are defined on a case-by-case basis; in any case, key rules and principles on sound and efficient financial management and on environmental requirements will be respected.</p>

<p>Counterfeiting has assumed significant proportions in terms of world trade, currently accounting for more than 10% of international trade. European companies are the primary victims of such completely unfair practices. In France, as throughout the territory of the European Union, cutlers are particularly badly affected by this scourge, with all its harmful effects on economic growth and employment. European cutlers consequently do not understand why knives and cutlery products coming into Europe are not labelled with the country of origin. The textiles and clothing sector, which faces the same challenges, has launched the creation of a 'Made in Europe' label. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of this sector, the Commission proposed in December 2003 the introduction of Community rules on origin marking of products manufactured in the European Union or imported into Community territory. A 'Made in the EU' label is envisaged for products manufactured in the European Union, to be introduced on a voluntary basis only in interested sectors.</p>
<p>How can European representatives of cutlers' trade organisations (in France, Germany and Spain) demonstrate their interest in a 'Made in Europe' label for their products to Commission departments?</p>

<p>(FR) Following a working document on the current situation of place of origin labelling and the possibilities of introducing a Community regulation on this subject, which was presented in December 2003, in the first few months of 2004 the Commission began a consultation process with European federations covering the different industrial sectors, consumer organisations, unions and other institutions. The results of this process were submitted to Committee 133 in July 2004. Far from reaching a unanimous agreement, only a few sectors (textile and clothing, leather and tannery, footwear, ceramics, rubber, tyres, furniture) showed their support for the initiative, and mainly for imported products. The ‘made in EU’ label, however, only seems to be acceptable to most sectors on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a European origin labelling scheme, perhaps limited to the sectors that have indicated their agreement at European level. This analysis includes technical, economic and legal aspects. At this stage, the Commission has not been able to obtain convincing indications that EU origin labelling could significantly contribute to combating counterfeiting.</p>
<p>Further meetings took place recently with the sectors concerned and a questionnaire addressed to the national consumer associations was circulated. An on-line consultation (Interactive Policy Making) is also going to be launched in the near future.</p>
<p>The European representatives of the cutlers’ professional organisations are invited to contact the services of the Commission Directorate-General for Trade, and their respective governments, in order to put forward their point of view on the initiative, and to reach an agreement with their European representatives. For specific information on combating counterfeiting, the European representatives can also contact the services of the Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0057"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for his question regarding a fundamental objective of its proposal on the 2007-2013 financial framework, which is European added value.</p>
<p>In its two general communications regarding the 2007-2013 financial framework<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in particular the communication of July 2004, the Commission highlighted the three elements that should help make the Union’s activities more effective. These elements were systematically taken into account in drawing up the legislative proposals for the 2007-2013 financial framework and are part of the idea of European added value.</p>
<p>Criterion 1 - effectiveness. Definition: EU action is the only way to get results in order to resolve missing links, avoid fragmentation and realise the potential of a border-free Europe. Examples: programmes promoting mobility in education and culture; trans-European networks.</p>
<p>Criterion 2 - efficiency. Definition: the EU offers better value for money, because externalities can be addressed, because action can be better coordinated and because of the resources and expertise available. Examples: research, the Galileo system, immigration and asylum policy, external relations (economies of scale).</p>
<p>Criterion 3 - synergy. Definition: EU action is necessary to complement, stimulate and leverage action and create synergies. Examples: cohesion policy for which EU action is a lever and complements national action; rural development; external relations.</p>
<p>The desire for greater effectiveness is also at the heart of the Commission’s proposals regarding the simplification and streamlining of instruments. There were therefore two guiding principles for drawing up the legislative proposals: the first aims to achieve ‘one instrument per policy area, one fund per programme'; the second aims to consider alternatives to in-house direct management. The Commission has also identified an overall approach on administrative governance, which will lead to streamlining and the selection of the most suitable and cost-effective delivery mechanism.</p>
<p>More specifically in relation to administrative expenditure, the Commission proposed that the structure of the 2007-2013 financial framework should be in line with the ABB structure of the annual budget. The development of administrative expenditure would have a less than proportionate link with that of operational expenditure, taking into account the specific characteristics of certain Commission activities such as competition policy or implementing the internal market, which only involve a marginal proportion of operational expenditure, while the main expenditure associated with these policies is administrative. For the majority of the Commission’s activities, for which the operational proportion is larger, we can reasonably anticipate that the increased effectiveness achieved at operational level will have a direct positive impact on administrative expenditure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Community customs tariff applicable to imports of raw aluminium and aluminium alloys is currently 6%. The majority of the Member States that joined the Community on 1 May 2004 previously applied a zero tariff to these imports, and therefore had to raise their customs tariffs in order to take on the acquis communautaire. Only one Member State, Hungary, requested and obtained a transitional derogation as part of the accession negotiations for a period of three years, during which decreasing quotas of these imports will be able to benefit from reduced tariffs.</p>
<p>The Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> defines the guiding principles and the procedure for dealing with requests for autonomous tariff suspensions or quotas. A number of requests regarding the products in question were submitted in 2004 by several new Member States within the Ad hoc Group on Economic Tariff Problems made up of experts from the Member States and the Commission. After careful consideration of these requests, it does not appear that any of the requests satisfied the principles laid down in the aforementioned communication. The Commission therefore concluded that the conditions for proposing such autonomous tariff suspensions or quotas under Article 26 of the Treaty establishing the European Community were not fulfilled, and therefore considered these requests to be rejected.</p>

<p>(EN) According to Article 149 of the EC Treaty, each Member State is responsible for the content of teaching and the organisation of its educational system. On this basis, the Union does not have the competence to oblige a Member State to regulate or not the profession of nutritionist in its territory, or to determine which diploma gives access to that profession, or to fix the content and level of training for the exercise of that profession.</p>
<p>The Union is competent only to take the measures necessary to ensure the free movement of professionals within the European Union. To that end Directives on the mutual recognition of diplomas have been adopted and are already in place. In addition, on 7 March 2002 the Commission made a proposal for a Directive on recognition of professional qualifications in order to improve the existing system.</p>
<p>In particular, in this proposal, any professional association or organisation that represents the profession at national and European level, may establish a common platform and submit it for adoption to the Commission. The purpose of the platform would be to ‘pre-define’ the qualification criteria to overcome the differences between the various national training courses so that a citizen qualified to exercise a profession in one Member State may obtain recognition of his/her diploma when moving to another Member State which regulates that profession, without having to undergo compensation measures. It must be emphasised that the purpose of the platform would not, in any way, be to force national authorities to harmonise their national legislation.</p>
<p>This proposal is currently being examined by the co-legislators in second reading.</p>
<p>As far as the issue of the inclusion of nutrition in the basic training of doctors is concerned, reference is made to the ‘doctors’ Directive’ 93/16/EC <a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which provides that during basic medical training, there is, inter alia, a ‘sufficient understanding of the structure, functions and behaviour of healthy and sick persons, as well as relations between the state of health and physical and social surroundings of the human being’ (Article 23, paragraph 1(b)). This allows nutrition to be taken into account and has not been altered by the new proposed legislation mentioned above.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for drawing attention to the need of taking measures to avoid the virus spreading in the European region. The Commission is concerned with the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in south-east Asia and it has already taken the relevant measures.</p>
<p>Reports of human-to-human transmission have so far been very sporadic. Infection was limited to family members and no wider transmission of the virus in the community has occurred.</p>
<p>The Commission is very well aware of the risks posed by the current Avian Influenza epidemics in certain Asian countries. It is working in close contact with the animal and public health authorities of the Member States, the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The Commission has already adopted a number of measures to prevent that the disease is introduced in the EU via trade in live poultry or other birds and in those products of avian origin that could pose a risk in relation to avian influenza.</p>
<p>At EU level, the Commission is following up the implementation of the proposals made in the Commission working paper on Community Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Planning adopted in March 2004 within the framework set out by the Council conclusions of 2 June 2004.</p>
<p>Key areas for action include the operation of the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and co-operation with the World Health Organisation on the co-ordination and facilitation of national pandemic planning in the Community and in the European region.</p>
<p>Regardless of the production of a vaccine with the avian influenza strain circulating in Asia, appropriate vaccines for pandemic influenza strains can unfortunately only be developed once the strains of the virus are precisely identified. Development and production of a vaccine can take up to a year to complete. Procurement and use of vaccines, however, is the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>As regards market authorisation of vaccines, the Commission has taken regulatory action to ensure that the market authorisation procedure is speeded up. Moreover, it has initiated a process of joint consultation with the European Vaccines Manufacturers and the Member States to ensure that there is a better capacity in place for the production of efficacious vaccines in good time.</p>
<p>The Commission has also been promoting a comprehensive research agenda in this field.</p>
<p>For anti-virals a dialogue with the industry has already been launched to ensure that access and availability to all Member States of such drugs is improved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0067"></a>

<p>(EN) The role of the Commission in the negotiations currently held in Council of Europe was already the subject of the reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0570_EN.html">H-0570/04</a> by Baroness Ludford during question time of Parliament’s January 2005 Plenary session. As pointed in this response the Commission is negotiating on behalf of the European Community further to a Council Decision of 28 June 2004 authorizing the Commission to negotiate the Draft European Convention on combating trafficking in human beings. This Council Decision covers those provisions of the Draft Convention that concern Community law (first pillar). It was adopted on the basis of existing EC legislation, in particular on Council Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities. Consequently, in the negotiations in Strasbourg the Commission aimed at ensuring a level of treatment for victims, who are third country nationals, at least complying with the standards set out in the EC Directive.</p>
<p>The question of a so-called non-punishment clause is not covered by Community law. Insofar the Commission is not authorised to negotiate. Member States negotiate themselves but have to respect the Common Position adopted on the basis of a proposal of the Commission by the Council on 25 October 2004 on negotiations relating to the Draft European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings being undertaken in the Council Europe. The Commission assists the Council Presidency in coordinating Member States positions. The Commission has supported the inclusion of a non-punishment clause into the convention and explicitly opposed the deletion of such clause, which was also discussed during the negotiations.</p>
<p>The use of the services of a trafficked person in the knowledge of the relevant circumstances must be considered as injustice and as an offence against that person. While the moral justification of criminalizing such act cannot be contested, Member States seem to have different views regarding the usefulness and possible practical impact of such measure. Against this background a further discussion of the question in the European Union will be necessary and should take place further to the Communication on trafficking in human beings the Commission will issue in 2005.</p>
<p>The question of an appropriate control or monitoring mechanism with regard to the implementation of the Convention is particularly important. The Commission is authorized to negotiate on this matter insofar as such monitoring concerns issues that are covered by Community law. The Commission supports a monitoring mechanism that is based on the work of independent experts. Furthermore, the Commission tries to ensure a coherent solution respecting the control mechanisms that are already established for the proper implementation of European Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0069"></a>

<p>(EN) European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)</p>
<p>45 of the 48 ERDF operational programmes of the second CSF for Greece (1994-1999) are now closed with the agreement of the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Of these, 22 were closed by the end of 2003. The closure of the remaining 23 operational programmes, containing a large number of public works projects, was delayed to give the Greek authorities the opportunity to submit additional elements in particular regarding the findings of ‘ESPEL’, the body responsible for verifying the quality of the works delivered. These additional elements were submitted up until the summer of 2004, and formed the basis for an agreed closure at the end of 2004.</p>
<p>For two ERDF Operational Programmes (OP), closure proposals have not yet been sent to the Greek authorities: operational programmes ‘Posts’ and ‘Rail’.</p>
<p>As regards OP ‘Posts’, closure has been delayed by the need to decide on the adequate treatment of a land purchase. This issue is now resolved and the closure proposal will be issued very soon.</p>
<p>For OP ‘Rail’, the delay was due to discussions on the findings of an audit carried out by the Commission's Directorate General (DG) for Regional Policy. The Greek authorities have submitted proposals for the follow-up of such findings in November 2004. The Commission's services have examined these proposals and expect to be able to make a closure proposal soon.</p>
<p>For ERDF operational programme ‘Roads’, the closure proposal sent to the Greek authorities in 2004 has not been accepted by them. A contradictory procedure according to Article 24 of Regulation 1260/1999, taking into account also the findings of a recent audit carried out by DG Regional Policy, is now to be expected.</p>
<p>European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)</p>
<p>As far as the EAGGF is concerned, 15 out of 18 operational programmes have already been closed in December 2004. Closure of these programmes was finalised in December 2004 after a long dialog with the Greek authorities regarding, amongst others, controls on the quality of public works operated by ESPEL. All programmes were closed with the agreement of the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Three programmes (Rural Development, CI Leader II and Leader II network) are still pending for closure as the dialog with the Greek authorities is still open. Should this dialog be completed in the next two months, closure may take place during this first semester of 2005.</p>
<p>European Social Fund (ESF)</p>
<p>All 24 operational programs of the ESF have been closed, 22 in 2003 and 2 in 2004, the latest in July 2004. In the context of all these ESF-programs, the Greek authorities have accepted the closure proposals from the Commission services.</p>
<p>With regard to the ESF, 1.88% of the credits of CSF II have been lost, (€ 48 million out of € 2 564 million), the reason being under-consumption and corrections made by the Commission in compliance with the regulatory requirements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0075"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the honourable Member’s position that promoting digital literacy is essential to fight the digital divide. The provision of digital skills has been supported by the Commission by means of a wide range of strategies<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> - such as eEurope, the European Employment Strategy, the Social Inclusion Process and the Social Agenda, the eLearning Action Plan – and tools, such as the European Social Fund and the EQUAL initiative. The importance of digital literacy has been supported by the work of the ESDIS Group (High level Group on the Employment and Social Dimension of the Information Society )<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and spelled out in a number of Council resolutions, namely on eInclusion (2001), on eAccessibility (2002) and Social and Human Capital (2003).</p>
<p>The Commission believes that an inclusive Information Society can only be achieved if three complementary axes are addressed:</p>
<p>ensure physical access to the technologies underpinning the Information Society</p>
<p>facilitate individuals’ participation and access to new Information Society processes and services</p>
<p>empower individuals and communities to take advantage of new opportunities offered by the Information Society.</p>
<p>To improve participation and empower individuals, the promotion of digital literacy is essential. Policies need to be based on a set of complementary actions such as awareness raising, capacity building, policy development, legislation, standardisation, public procurement, education, social dialogue, exchange of best practices, financing of social services, monitoring and benchmarking.</p>
<p>The Commission is promoting the principle of ‘making the necessary knowledge available to all’ and increasing digital literacy in the European Union from two perspectives. First, in terms of Information Society Technology (IST) research, the area of ‘ICT for Inclusion’ aims at full participation in the Information Society of all individuals on equal terms. Improving eSkills and understanding the type of eContent and supporting technologies relevant to each specific target community or group at risk of exclusion have been already identified as relevant areas for research.</p>
<p>Second, from the policy perspective, in the forthcoming Commission Communication on eAccessibility<a href="#defann_66_3" name="refann_66_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, one of the likely actions to be proposed is to increase skills. There is already much knowledge on how to foster eAccessibility and how to avoid creating new barriers, partly based on the research funded by the Commission. This knowledge needs to be shared among Member States and translated into practical guidelines for implementation. The public consultation on this Communication (the results of which will be available shortly) brought an overwhelming response, particularly on this issue. More than 73% of the respondents have identified ‘developing eSkills’ as essential or very important.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the policy initiative i2010, which will be presented by the Commission in May 2005, the contribution of the Information Society to growth and employment will be addressed, encompassing the need to increase digital literacy and improve eSkills.</p>
<p>Finally, at the international level, in the recent World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) Communication<a href="#defann_66_4" name="refann_66_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Commission identified improving digital skills as a key element of the priority actions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Responsibility for the curriculum is a matter for Member States or their regions. It lies outside the Union’s competence. The Commission will thus not propose a programme along the lines suggested.</p>
<p>However, in the context of the contribution of Education to the Lisbon strategy, the Commission, in cooperation with experts from Member States, has defined a European framework for key competences that everyone should acquire by the end of compulsory education. This framework comprises fundamental basic skills such as literacy and numeracy but also broader competences such as social and interpersonal, civic and cultural competences that are vital for personal fulfilment, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. In particular, within these competences there is a strong presence of the European dimension, covering the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes. The framework will be proposed before the end of 2005 by the Commission to the Council and the Parliament as a Recommendation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Community programmes in education and training and particularly COMENIUS, promote the European dimension of studies through partnerships between schools from all over Europe, and the proposed integrated Lifelong Learning programme (2007-2013)<a href="#defann_71_1" name="refann_71_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which is currently under examination by the Council and the Parliament, aims to further enhance the European dimension at all levels of education and training.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In accordance with the EU-Treaty any European country that respects the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law may apply to become a member of the European Union. The European system of rules has been very effective in producing peace and prosperity; it would therefore not seem expedient to draw the limits that this zone of peace and prosperity can reach in the future, basing oneself on today’s information.</p>
<p>The term ‘European’ country has never been clearly defined by the EU and would certainly have to take into account geographic but also cultural and historic elements. There is no simple formula and each application for accession would have to be considered on its merits for the European Union as well as for the country concerned. Although the final borders of the EU have not been determined yet, the EU is currently developing other forms of partnership and cooperation than full membership with neighbouring countries such as the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p>With regard to the honourable Member’s second point, whether the enlargement process affects the pace of integration, the Commission would like to underline that experience shows that EU-enlargement often gave impetus for new developments like the Single Market, the Maastricht Treaty or the drafting of the European Constitution. We need to make sure that this will also be the case with future enlargements. We therefore have to constantly re-evaluate our performance in the enlarged EU and – based on a thorough and honest assessment – carefully consider the options. In this context it should be kept in mind that the Copenhagen criteria also refer to the ‘Union’s capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration …’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0099"></a>

<p>(EN) There is indeed a positive turn of events in the Middle East which should lead back to the Quartet’s Road Map with the goal of a two-state state solution. However this cannot be taken for granted. Both President Abbas and Prime Minister Sharon will need to build up support within their own constituencies and to face down opponents of peace.</p>
<p>The Commission is seeking to support this process by remaining engaged with both parties on the following measures : to provide significant financial support for Palestinian Authority reform, focussing on the fight against corruption and promoting good government and financial transparency; strengthening the democratic process; to implement the Action Plans for Israel and the Palestinian Authority endorsed by the Council under the European Neighbourhood Policy; and to use the improved climate in trans-atlantic relations to ensure that our action and that of the United States are complementary and coordinated. The EU Special Representative is co-ordinating the EU’s support for the Palestinian security services.</p>
<p>The Commission is ready to provide financial resources to support the process of disengagement from Gaza, under the conditions laid down by the Council. This could include support for infrastructure measures to provide a quick start to the economy following withdrawal.</p>
<p>Regarding the security barrier the Commission refers to the EU’s position that the route of the wall is illegal under international law when on occupied territory, and affects the livelihood and humanitarian situation of Palestinians living in the wall’s vicinity. This issue is discussed with Israel and there appears to be an openness to revisit the route of the wall and bring it closer to the 1967-line.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0100"></a>

The Commission is prepared to consider the derogation requests from Member States that respond to the above-mentioned conditions.</p>
<p>However, the Commission’s approach is that a derogation request must be based on an action programme fully compliant with the Directive.

Ireland has not yet submitted an action programme which the Commission considers to be fully compliant with the Directive.</p>

<p>In 2002 the European circuit board industry accounted for about 16% of the world market. Partly because of the current market consolidation, but mainly because of significant locational disadvantages and customs barriers, this branch of industry is threatening to migrate to Asia. There is, for example, a significant imbalance in the duty charged on products. European purchasers do not pay any customs duties for finished products (circuit boards) from Asia. On the other hand, customs duties of 5-7% are charged on primary materials, which according to information from the industry can account for up to 50% of manufacturing costs, when imported to Europe from Asia. Since these products are essential for domestic producers, however, the customs charge puts them at a distinct disadvantage.</p>
<p>Do these arrangements amount to discrimination against Community manufacturers of circuit boards and distort competition with Asian competitors?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member refers in his question to circuit boards which can be imported duty free from third countries. Printed circuits without any active electrical elements fall with CN code 8534 00. Such products have been duty free since 1 January 2000 due to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA). Populated printed circuit boards, get ITA duty free treatment when they are classified as parts of finished products such as personal computers.</p>
<p>The production of these goods mainly requires chemicals for edging (CN Chapter 29, duty rate 6,5%), plastics (CN Chapter 39, duty rate 6,5%) and copper foil (CN Chapter 74 duty rate 5,2%) as primary materials. However, in cases where the EU industry imports some of these primary materials, it has the possibility to apply for the customs procedure called ‘transformation under customs control’. By this procedure Community producers can be authorised, when it is economically justified, to use imported materials duty free in the production of goods which are not subject to import duties when imported from a third country. Given this situation it is very unlikely that import duties on raw materials are a prime cause for the transfer of such industries to third countries.</p>
<p>The Commission considers therefore that issues other than tariffs are much more likely to influence the decision where to locate such factories. These could be labour costs and, for the most sophisticated multilayered boards the availability of advanced technology. Equally important may be investment aids that can attract foreign direct investment into some parts of Asia, as well as environmental considerations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0104"></a>

The report on the activities under the PHARE programme, the main aim of which was to ensure research into BSE in livestock, was rejected by the European Commission Representative, which also cancelled the tender. The resulting situation caused an undesirable turnaround of affairs for Poland, which was compelled to ask the European Commission Representative to agree to reopening the tender and extending the contract period, or to agree to initiating an open tender with a shortened notice period. If agreed to, this will unquestionably lead to all manner of procedural activities with huge time pressures and funds will have to be committed from Poland's own budget which had been allocated to other objectives linked to the fight against contagious diseases. This will cause a temporary budget shortfall for the Veterinary Inspectorate, whilst also drastically reducing (by over 25%) the funds for the prevention of other animal diseases.</p>
