<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barroso,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I believe that we share a common ambition: a strong and independent Commission that can drive Europe forward with this Parliament and with all those who have that same vision.</p>
<p class="contents">I take note of the resolution on which you have just voted. I look forward to examining it closely. However, my first impression is that it can provide a good basis for us to reach agreement on how we will work together over the next five years. These arrangements should be formalised through an early updating of the framework agreement adopted in 1999, to guide the cooperation between our two institutions. I would only ask that our agreed approach takes account of our respective roles and obligations and the European Union Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Before dealing with detailed points set out in point 5 of your resolution, let me reconfirm that I stand by my commitments regarding the creation of a Commissioners' Group on Fundamental Rights and new proposals in this important area.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the specific issues in point 5, let me give a first response.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to points 5 (a), (b) and (c), as I indicated yesterday, I have sought and received a commitment from my team that the Commissioners will resign if I ask them to do so. I will examine very seriously any criticism expressed by this Parliament regarding the performance of Commissioners. I stand ready to explain to Parliament the conclusions that I draw. In this way we are affirming the principle of individual responsibility of every Commissioner, without calling into question the principle of collegiality for which, under the Treaty, the President of the Commission is guarantor.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the replacement of Commissioners, we must make a distinction between the current situation, which foresees no role for either the Commission President or Parliament, and the future situation under the Constitution. The Constitution will bring the procedure for replacing Commissioners closer to the procedure for the confirmation of the Commission at the start of its mandate. In this transitional phase, I can therefore agree that new Commission members should not appear officially before this Parliament until they have met with the relevant parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards their appearance before Council, that is not entirely in my hands, since a nominated new Commissioner will have to carry out duties linked to his or her portfolio. In the event of a reshuffle of my team, I accept a similar obligation that Commissioners whose portfolios change should not appear officially before this Parliament until they have met with the relevant parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to points 2 and 5 (d), your resolution suggests that we have not yet taken the necessary steps to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Yesterday I explained the detailed arrangements for dealing with potential conflict of interest problems that might arise in a portfolio. Let us now implement them. We will have the opportunity to assess their effectiveness at a later stage. I will make any further changes that prove necessary in the light of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to point 5 (e), as I indicated in July, I share Parliament's view of the need to strengthen multiannual programming and strategic planning, together with the Council. I will therefore present to you in January draft proposals for the five-year strategic objectives of the Union, which should be jointly adopted by all institutions. I will listen to your debate on the subject in December and take account of your main concerns. This anticipates this important new area of cooperation, also provided for in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Now points 5 (f) and 5 (g). Our relationship must be built on trust and regular contacts. My team will therefore give priority to appearing before this Parliament. Both I and Vice-President Wallström intend to maintain regular and active contact with the Conference of Presidents. The announcement of Commission decisions and proposals to Parliament reflects the current arrangements under the framework agreement, which I am, of course, willing to respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that this has not always been implemented satisfactorily, either for the Parliament or for the Commission, particularly as regards communicating effectively to the wider public what the Union does. I hope that we can discuss improvements to this arrangement, focused on identifying the most important proposals deserving the attention of Parliament and our joint communication effort. Presentation of these proposals should be timed as far as possible to coincide with plenary sessions. If we can do this, I would argue for greater flexibility on other more routine initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 5 (h). The Commission already explains how it will follow up the positions of Parliament on legislative proposals. Experience shows that this mechanism is useful and I will be happy to extend it to positions taken by Parliament in cases other than legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 5 (i). We need to distinguish between issues related to the flow of information between the Commission and the European Parliament and issues linked more generally to access to European documents covered by existing legislation (Regulation 1049/01)</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to look with you at ways of improving the flow of information between Parliament and the Commission. As I stated last July, it is a fundamental requirement for this Parliament to provide democratic oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Regulation 1049/01, we should consider practical experience with the rules on access to documents. Nevertheless, we should not forget that those rules have been enforced for only a little over two years. We should not therefore plan an immediate review, but rather agree a timetable for a review during the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the rules on access to documents were agreed by codecision, we should not forget that this is an area where the agreement of the Council will also be required.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 5 (j). The main guidelines of the code of conduct governing the behaviour and operation of the new Commission have already been endorsed by my team. I am willing to inform the European Parliament of any changes to the provisions of the code on conflicts of interests or ethical behaviour and will take due account of any views it expresses on such changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 5 (k). I believe the common approach to setting agreed priorities and planning our work and the more regular contacts between our institutions will help to improve the flow of information in these two areas. However, we should look at possible improvements in the light of current experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, generally speaking I consider this resolution a good basis. Vice-President Wallström and I will work with you constructively, addressing the points I have just made and any others that our two institutions might think appropriate, with the aim of reinforcing the roles of the European Parliament and the Commission in their work for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few weeks we have been witness to what I believe to be a valuable exercise in European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Not once have you heard me utter a single word in criticism of Parliament, even during the most difficult times and even when no agreement could be reached. Quite the contrary, I have always given you constructive answers, which were proof of my desire to cooperate with your institution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is my opinion that we have now resolved all the problems in a spirit of compromise, and, after all, the only way in which Europe can be built is in a spirit of compromise. It is impossible to please all the people all the time; compromises must always be made. We have reached an outcome which is, on the whole, satisfactory, and I am delighted at this fact. We owe it to the people of Europe to ensure that the European institutions which come out of this exercise are stronger and better able to meet the public’s expectations. You will be aware of what these expectations are: more growth, more jobs and a strengthening of the European model, which combines reforms and economic dynamism with solidarity and social cohesion. You have before you a competent and efficient Commission, and I can assure you that as its leader I will devote all my energies to achieving these objectives and to ensuring that the men and women of Europe notice what has changed. I am counting on your support.</p>

It is clear from this convincing result that this House is united in its desire to work constructively with the Commission while also exercising its parliamentary and democratic control over it.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution expresses a desire for a good working relationship between the Commission and this House. The Commission and Parliament need to regard each other, in principle, as allies, and that not only because of the attitude of some governments. Necessary though it is that this House should monitor the Commission, we would have you know, Mr President of the Commission, that we are, in principle, always shoulder to shoulder with it, for it is an important European Union institution. When acting as the guardian of the Treaties and watching over adherence to the law, you will always have us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, at your side.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As you mentioned in your response, we want to implement the content of this resolution in the form of a framework agreement with you, just as we had done with the Prodi Commission, and we should start working on that together soon. It will then be for Mrs Wallström, as the future Vice-President, to continue the work of her remarkable predecessor Mrs de Palacio, with whom we negotiated the framework agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very important is what we have resolved as regards the confidence that we place in the members of the Commission or deny them, and, if Parliament adopts a motion of no confidence in one of them, it is then that you, Mr President of the Commission, must give serious thought – as is already stated in the agreement with the Prodi Commission – as to whether you should dismiss him or her. If you do not do as this House demands, then you must appear before it to justify yourself, and that, in parliamentary terms, represents an advance over the situation that existed before.</p>
<p class="contents">At no time in the course of the next five years must your Commission include among its members anyone who has not gone through the parliamentary process. If changes are made in the Commission, for whatever reason, we insist that every new member of the Commission should undergo hearings in this House. That is what it says in the resolution, and we are going to make sure that it is in the framework agreement.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is good to see the whole college of the Commission here, and what we expect of you throughout your mandate is that you should always give an account of yourselves to Parliament whenever it – through the plenary, its committees, or any other of its bodies – so demands. When Parliament summons you, your presence before it takes precedence over all other commitments you may have made, and that is important, for it is to Parliament that you are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On this we will insist, and – in view of the widely divergent conduct of the members of the former Commission in their dealings with this House – we will be very vigilant to see that this is actually done.</p>
<p class="contents">Your strategic programme will be very important, and we expect you to present it in January. In an earlier resolution, the Conference of Presidents had in fact decided that, had the process not been delayed, we would have had a debate in November, in this part-session, on what this House’s expectations of this are. We have now decided that the House will set out its principles in a resolution in December. It is then that you can, and must, not only take note of Parliament’s positions, but also bring them and the Commission’s strategic programme into line.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that our group finds it regrettable that the motion on subsidiarity tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was not adopted. It is our contention that, where Europe has the competence to act, it must do so, with strength and reason, but it must not claim every task and role for itself; there are still the municipalities, the districts, the regions, and the nation states. Each of these four levels has its own tasks to perform, and that is why we adhere to the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that our group will, today, be united in expressing our confidence in you. While being alongside you, we will express criticisms in a positive way, but will also be determined to exercise our right of parliamentary control, and so, with that in mind, we wish you, Mr President, and your college of Commissioners, all the best and every success for the next five years.</p>

Willy Brandt said that the European Parliament was not given rights; it had to fight for them. This House has indeed fought for rights for itself over the past three weeks, and we can all take pride in the fact that it succeeded, for we have put a stop to a trend – the trend towards excessive governmental power in the European Union. We have made it clear that Parliament, being the freely-elected representative assembly of the peoples, is equal to, and possesses the same prerogatives as, the bodies representing the states and their governments.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have seen happening here in this House over the past three weeks is a demonstration of how far democracy has advanced in Europe. This struggle against governments, and also against executives with which one does not agree, is what parliaments are elected for; it is the reason why they exist, and it is in order to engage in this struggle that delegates are elected to parliaments. If our struggle is attended by the same success as we have had, we gain – as we have all noticed – popular confidence in our institution. People understand that. From the North Cape to Sicily, from the Azores to the border with Russia by way of East Frisia, they understood what this struggle was about. Their approval of this Parliament of ours has never been as high as it is now, and that is something we should make use of. It makes this institution stronger.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Both institutions – Parliament and the Commission – have come out of this process stronger, and you, Mr President, with the Commission over which you now preside, have every opportunity to bring about change. Let me pick up what you said about a blind date, which was a fine phrase to choose. Some blind dates can be exciting; not all of those you have been on were. If you no longer want to go on blind dates, then tell the governments, quite plainly, that the procedure under which you, Mr Barroso, have to accept everyone they propose to you, and then pay the political price for their proposals – that, with the Barroso Commission, that procedure has come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you do that, both you and the Commission will be winners. You will both be the stronger for it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate that has gone on over the past few weeks, we have concentrated on core messages. If I may remind you of the hearings and of what came out of them – for it was from these that the conflict arose – these core messages can be summed up in one sentence, which is that a broad majority in this House stood up in defence of the civil fundamental values of the European Union. The freedom of opinion of each and every individual is indeed one of these, but another is the right of Parliament to decide who shall join the executive and who shall not. Yet another is the strengthening of democracy. The freely-elected assembly of the people has come out of this with renewed strength, and that is a good thing. It is a good thing, because without it, we cannot treat one another as equals.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, you are quite entitled to criticise Parliament. I can recall how, in one of this House’s debates a few days ago, you certainly did have criticisms to make, albeit of only one side of this House. You are quite entitled to do that, but we are obliged to check up on what the executive does. So let me repeat that we will, whenever – and I mean whenever! – incompatibilities arise, and whenever we think your Commission or the policy guidance are going in the wrong direction, take exactly the same action as we have done over the past three weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The interplay between the executive and parliament at European level lies in the fact that you have the monopoly of initiative, while it is our duty to ensure that the laws made are just and socially balanced, and that is precisely what we will be doing over the five years that lie ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What we learn from the experience of history is that more democracy always brings with it more social justice. For that reason, the democratic progress we have achieved is, for us, the beginning of a battle that we will be waging for five years. I said it yesterday, and I shall repeat it today, that Europe’s social achievements, which have come to pass in the Member States, cannot be sacrificed at European level. It is there that they must be secured, and this we see as your Commission’s crucial task. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will approve the proposals you have put forward today.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members in our group are not yet convinced and will not be giving you a vote of confidence today. It is now for you, over the coming years, to win them, too, over to your side. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament approves your proposal. I wish you success in working for social cohesion and social justice in Europe.</p>

Some of our Members will not. There is work to be done and we feel on balance, Mr Barrosso, that your Commission is now ready to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group listened to your closing remarks in the debate last night with some concern. Frankly, we listened with concern about your ability to understand this House. I was surprised to hear you say that a political group had been given a veto over the movement of a Commissioner, because we all know that is a privilege normally reserved for national capitals. I was surprised to hear you suggest that a political group in this House had tied your hands, because I thought they had already been tied in Rome, in Budapest, in The Hague!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If the group you referred to was mine, I am not aware of it issuing any statements insisting on any of the Commissioners being kept in their post. Indeed, I have said publicly that you must have the freedom to make your own decisions on the distribution of portfolios for your new team. We want you to have that freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">You blamed the House for the lack of freedom to manoeuvre when, in fact, we have worked with you to build this compromise and when not one of us in this Parliament faces the European government that we might have chosen for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The approval process for the Commission does not end here. This House is not in the business of granting tenure. Today you get your driving licence. Tomorrow we start on the rules of the road.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a new framework agreement because without the ability to scrutinise your Commission effectively, we cannot do our job properly. Parliamentary oversight without some possibility of sanction is paper tiger democracy and we want something better. A month ago we insisted on something better. The motion for a resolution tabled today makes it clear that we do not take lightly the issues of propriety or competence or conflict of interest for any Commissioner in any portfolio. Where concerns exist, this Parliament will be watching. Liberals and Democrats will be watching.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome your willingness to renew the framework agreement on stronger terms. We do not want to tie your hands or hold you hostage. Every power that Parliament gains carries with it a burden of responsibility and that is something we must shoulder along with you and your college. But good European government means accountable European government as you have said yourself.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-elect, Liberals and Democrats offer you a licence to get to work. You will have our constructive partnership, but we do not have the gift of authority. That is something that you and your Commissioners will have to earn: every day, every month, brick by brick, in this stronger, closer European Union.</p>

The notion of ‘all power to the imagination’ has been replaced today by ‘all power to hypocrisy’, and it is very clear what is happening. We showed that the majority of the Members of this House did not agree with the chairmen of Parliament’s largest groups, including the Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and even, at one point, the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. A majority of Members believed that we should be more vocal in our criticism of Mr Barroso’s proposals than the chairmen wanted to be. This has been the truth of the matter over the past few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we have now suddenly discovered that all our criticisms of this Commission were only of limited value. Mr Barroso delivered a strong and forceful speech to this House in July in which he told us that he would not obey the wishes of Mr Chirac or Mr Schröder. Now, however, he is telling us that he will obey the wishes of Harry Potter, alias Mr Balkenende; this is a compliment to Mr Balkenende, by the way, as I am a big fan of Harry Potter. Yet why does the Dutch Prime Minister receive a thumbs-up with regard to Mrs Kroes, whereas Mr Schröder was refused a super-commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">The independence of these great democrats is truly astonishing. Mr Poettering himself said in a television interview that the presence in the Commission of Mrs Kroes, who has so many scandals behind her, would not be tolerated. Yet today no one is interested in discussing the problem, which nonetheless remains a problem, that we now have a Commissioner responsible for competition who is unable to stand for the independence of the Commission as she is the product of her history. Seen in such a context, the situation really is unthinkable, and I should like to say to those many Members of this House who are critical of the sections of the Commission that have remained unchanged that by voting ‘yes’, and by giving Mr Barroso a blank cheque in doing so, you will undermine your criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that Mr Barroso will gain a majority, but why on earth should he be given a majority which will allow him to walk all over us when it comes to policy-making? To all of you who consider yourselves politicians today – and I am addressing all those who are still wondering whether they should vote for, vote against or abstain – I should like to say that I am aware that the rest of you are followers, not leaders, and indeed the majority of the PPE-DE Group would have voted in favour of the Commission last time. When one is a follower, one remains so from beginning to end; my remarks are therefore not directed at you, but at those who did not wish to hand Mr Barroso a blank cheque. I ask you to think it over, to vote no or to abstain, in order to prove that we take a critical stance and that Mr Barroso has made another poor job of his proposals.</p>

Yet we believe that this is an illusory success, as it is the product of one of these top-level schemes that give rise to the crises they are intended to resolve. The Commission is now as good as in place, but it has had an easy start compared with what is to come. Five months ago, a clear majority of European citizens showed their deep disaffection with the European institutions, accusing us of building a Europe in which they felt increasingly lost. Since your appointment, Mr Barroso, have you sent any kind of message to these citizens which is likely to imbue European integration with renewed meaning?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, you have achieved celebrity by surreptitiously attempting to give the Commission a slant which in other climes would pass for being neo-conservative, in assigning the highly symbolic portfolio of freedom, security and justice to a proponent of an obscurantist and old-fashioned mode of thinking. This caused a general outcry in many sectors of the European public, an outcry you had not anticipated, and it is much to Parliament’s credit that it echoed this feeling by halting last month’s proposal in its tracks. Yet it is not to the credit of the President of the Commission that he has once again entrusted such sensitive tasks to someone from the same government, which is the least credible of all the European governments in terms of justice and the defence of freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you have given still more impetus than your predecessors to what is at the root of the European public’s crisis of confidence in the Europe being built today, a Europe based on the trend towards neo-liberalism and the cult of ‘everything for sale’. In this respect, your refusal to hear the objections which came from all quarters as a result of your approach to the competition portfolio is unlikely to appease people’s fears.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President of the Commission, you should not forget that the majority of Europeans have been opposed to President Bush’s warmongering exploits from the very beginning. Despite the painful lessons delivered daily by events on the ground, we are still waiting for you to express any kind of doubts with regard to your unfortunate Azores initiative, which served to divide Europe on a matter of crucial importance to all of civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">A vote in favour of investiture is a vote of confidence. For the three reasons I have given, and without my wishing to pass judgment on individual Commissioners, we have no confidence in this Commission as a whole. Guided by our commitment to a vision of Europe in which our fellow citizens feel at home, we will vote against the Barroso Commission.</p>

Well, let us conduct a human audit. I am mindful that audits are not very popular in the European Commission and that auditors – if they do their job properly – get fired, but nonetheless here goes:</p>
<p class="contents">From France we have Mr Barrot, who will take on transport. In 2000 he received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for his involvement in an embezzlement case and was banned from holding public office for two years.</p>
<p class="contents">From Hungary we have Mr Kovács, who will take on taxation. For many years he was a Communist apparatchik, a friend of Mr Kádár, the dictator in Hungary, and an outspoken opponent of the values that we hold dear in the West.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)</span></p>
<p class="contents">His new empire will produce taxation policy and he will look after the customs union from Cork to Vilnius. Are the PPE Group and the British Conservatives really going to vote for that?</p>
<p class="contents">From Estonia we have Mr Kallas, who for 20 years was a Soviet Party apparatchik until his newly acquired taste for capitalism got him into trouble. However, to be fair, he was acquitted of abuse and fraud but convicted for providing false information. He is going to be in charge of the anti-fraud drive! You could not make this up!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause from the IND/DEM Group)</span></p>
<p class="contents">From the UK we have Mr Mandelson, who will take on the trade portfolio. He, of course, was removed twice from the British Government, but to be fair, he is one of the more competent ones!</p>
<p class="contents">From the Netherlands we have Mrs Kroes, who will take on competition. She is accused of lying to the European Parliament. These may be only allegations, but they are made by Mr van Buitenen and should be listened to.</p>
<p class="contents">Ask yourself a question: would you buy a used car from this Commission? The answer simply must be 'No'! Even if they were competent and even if this were a high-quality Commission – sorry, Mr Barroso, but I do not think it is – we would still vote 'No' on the political principle that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties; the Commission is the motor for integration; the Commission initiates the legislation that is damaging our businesses across Europe so badly; the Commission is the embodiment of all that is worst in this European Union; the Commission is the government of Europe and is not directly accountable to anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Please, when you vote, take note that 20 of these Commissioners have already said that they intend to attempt to implement the Constitution even before it has been ratified by Member State governments. In the face of such breathtaking arrogance, nobody in the Independence and Democracy Group will vote for this Commission.</p>

<p class="contents">As was saying, it is important that we reflect on what has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would have welcomed the opportunity during the last part-session to have voted on the composition of the Commission as it was presented to us at that juncture. Unfortunately, a majority in this Parliament convinced others that the vote should not go ahead. However, the Council and the Commission have responded to the concerns which Parliament raised and brought forward a new proposal and a new team, which we now have the responsibility to endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">In no way would I disallow any Member' right to express a negative opinion on individual members of the Commission. However, it is important and incumbent upon us to ensure that Members of this Parliament do not use Parliament to fight domestic political battles with governments they do not ideologically agree with. It denigrates this House and its Members when we refuse to allow people to hold opinions that we may not agree with. If anything, Europe should be about defending freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of ideas, even though we may not agree with those ideas or thoughts.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Once the dust has settled, the people of Europe will not be judging us on the agility of political groupings within this Parliament or on whether we can get one over on another institution. They will not judge us on whether Parliament is stronger than the Council or equal to the Council or the Commission. They will not judge us on who we stopped from becoming a Commissioner. They will judge us and the Commission on the basis of what we can deliver to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to stop the political games and get on with the real agenda of making the Lisbon Strategy work, of ensuring that the people of Europe have better access to better-quality jobs and better-quality opportunities and of promoting Europe's role on the wider stage. In six months' time the people of Europe will not know who the individual Commissioners that we rejected were. What they will be asking, however, is what Europe did about Darfur, what Europe did about the Ivory Coast and what Europe did to help the people most marginalised within our society.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this House we have a voice. We are elected to use that voice to speak on behalf of the people who put us here to be their representatives. But who will speak for the lonely and the unfairly treated? If not us, then who? Who will speak for the downtrodden and the oppressed? If not us, then who? Who will give us the right to speak on behalf of all of those people if we use our time and energy trying to get one over on a neo-Liberal, neo-Conservative, Communist – or whatever – approach?</p>
<p class="contents">The great thing about this Commission and the European Union is that they have allowed people of different political ideologies to put aside their individual ideologies in order to arrive at a consensus for the common good. We should never start at a consensus, but we should always end with a consensus and compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you and your team have shown a willingness to listen to the concerns of this Parliament. I hope and believe that will continue. Likewise, your responsibilities and duties under the Treaties are important. Occasionally you will have to stand up and not give in to every demand from governments or this Parliament. It is only when we have that kind of interinstitutional friction that we will truly achieve the best results.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this Commission. Most of our group will support it, as indeed most of Parliament will support it. We ask for fair play in return for that support.</p>

Mr Buttiglione, a free man of Catholic faith, has been replaced by Mr Frattini, a model freemason. Mrs Udre, a Latvian accused of being a Eurosceptic by one of her fellow citizens, has also been replaced. Yet neither Mr Kovács, the former Stalinist found by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to be entirely incompetent, nor Mrs Fischer Boel and Mrs Kroes, who have attracted criticism over potential conflicts of interest, have been replaced.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears to me that a moral can be drawn from the Buttiglione affair, and that this affair has claimed three victims. The moral is that to be a European Commissioner, one must be Euro-compatible, that is to say politically, mentally and even religiously correct, as well as being an aficionado of tolerance, of the principle of non-discrimination and, above all, of human rights, the latter-day bible of right-thinking people. Any kind of deviation will from now on be harshly punished.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now turn to the victims, the first of which is the future European Constitution. The European Parliament has flouted both Article II-70, on freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and Article II-71, on freedom of expression and opinion, and in some ways Mr Buttiglione is the first secular martyr of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The second victim is Italy, which gave in to the European Parliament when the latter forced Mr Berlusconi to replace the Commissioner he had appointed, and whose competence and honesty had not been challenged by anyone before his hearing. The third and final victim is the European Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, as both have emerged weakened from this trial of strength with Parliament. No, Mr Barroso, you were neither held hostage to the extreme right nor were you its victim, as you wrongly claimed; you fell victim to your own errors of judgment. You realised a little too late that we were heading for a confrontation, and that this House intended to make you capitulate in order to reaffirm its authority <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As for us European right-wingers, proud of our beliefs and relying on the support of the people, we will defend our fellow citizens from both the European super-state and the accession of Turkey by voting against the investiture of your Commission. I should like to make one final point. Mr President, you yourself have admitted that you interfered in French affairs by lending the Portuguese Government’s support to Mr Chirac during the 2002 presidential elections. Mr Chirac, who everyone knows is unfamiliar with both Europe’s geography and its history, recently said that we are all children of Byzantium. It is hard to think of a more sinister omen, since the children of Byzantium, busy discussing the sex of angels with their parents and their councillors, were overwhelmed by the Islamic army of Sultan Mehmet II on 29 May 1453 after a month-and-a-half-long siege. In a symbolic and barbaric gesture, the Sultan dipped his hand in the blood of the dead Christians and daubed this blood on the wall of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which became and has remained Istanbul’s main mosque.</p>
