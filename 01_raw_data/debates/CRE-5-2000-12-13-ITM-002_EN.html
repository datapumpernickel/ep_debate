<p class="contents">Last April, after having voted through a very large majority of the amendments I was proposing to the Commission’s text but faced with the latter’s refusal to accept any of these, we decided to refer the matter to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development with a view to finding a possible compromise. Since there is no codecision procedure, it was the only way, since our priorities were to ensure guaranteed income and market access for both Community and ACP producers.</p>
<p class="contents">We tried to arrive at a conciliation with the Commission, but this did not really come about. Now, however, Parliament is to deliver its opinion. I would therefore remind you that, in November 1999, the Commission made its umpteenth proposal for modifying the COM in bananas, mainly with regard to external aspects and with a view to ensuring that this COM was compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. At that time, the Commission proposed maintaining a non-discriminatory, fixed-quota system with a slight rating preference for the ACP countries and the transition to a ‘tariff only’ system in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In April 2000, Parliament adopted my first report, together with its amendments, which ran counter to the Commission’s proposal. In particular, the report proposed rejecting the automatic transition to a ‘tariff only’ system, a rating preference for the ACP countries of at least EUR 300 and an assessment and possible revision of the COM’s internal aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The banana issue is a long way from being a mere anecdote and a great deal is at stake here. Since 1993, the situation where Community producers are concerned has been constantly deteriorating. The same applies to many traditional ACP supplier countries. Well, I would remind you that the main objective of this common organisation of the market is to guarantee access to the Community market for these countries’ products. It is now already impossible for these producers to enter into fair competition with international producers and operators in the sector. Let us remember that 62% of imports now come from third countries, mainly Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica and Honduras.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea here is not to be protectionist in defending products from certain countries but rather to safeguard the survival of a certain method of production. Behind the issue of bananas, an attempt is being made to defend an entire production industry, upon which whole regions, their life force and social balance sometimes depend.</p>
<p class="contents">Entire months elapsed before, last October, the Commission published a communication on the application of the ‘first come, first served’ method to administering the quota system. I emphasise that this was a communication and not a legislative proposal. We have therefore had to continue working on the November 1999 legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been liaison with the Commission, and it was clear from the last meeting that the Commission was maintaining its position, i.e. a quota system administered according to the ‘first come, first served’ method and a transition to a ‘tariff only’ system in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">My second report therefore looks very much like the first and again takes up the amendments voted on in Parliament. Even in the absence of a legislative proposal, however, a pronouncement also needed to be made on the ‘first come, first served’ method. Codecision does not mean that the system is fair, but it means that it is the only method compatible with the rules of the WTO. However, the United States has already made it known that it rejects this system, as have the ACP countries, moreover. Other than that our position thus remains the same: apply the system for at least ten years in order to guarantee producers’ and operators’ legal security and then re-examine the system at the end of the ten years; no automatic transition to a ‘tariff only’ system; and a rating preference of EUR 300 for the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have asked for guarantees in the event of the Commission putting in place the ‘first come, first served’ system for administering the rating quotas, for there would be serious repercussions for the ACP producers, who are at present incapable of taking their place in the boat race which is about to begin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial to find, in addition to the EUR 300 rating preference, a means of permitting them effective access to quota ‘C’ and of making an ongoing assessment of the impact of the system on these producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we have still been able to arrive at a unanimous vote within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I should like to thank my colleagues, as well as Mr Fernández Martín, draftsman of the opinion for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for his support.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to express my regret at the fact that, on a subject like this, the European Union appears to be abandoning its values in favour of the rules of world trade. The economy is there to serve man and, in any system in which man predominates, the rules should be adapted to the wishes and needs of man, never the other way around. The Commission and the Council would be abrogating their responsibility if they were to judge otherwise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not wish to get too excited, since we have been holding debates like this for eight years and we will hold more. Today, however, after the agreement reached in the Council, the Commission’s latest proposal is closer to the position often expressed by a majority in this Parliament over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I am speaking, supports the Dary report, since it responds to the fundamental problems. It maintains the quota system which safeguards the sale of Community-produced bananas, it establishes a system of licences through the ‘first come, first served’ method, which conforms to the standard rules of world trade, and it provides for a non-automatic transfer to a tariff system which will require an assessment report on its possible impact.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has already been accepted by Ecuador, the world’s leading banana producer and one of the parties which has complained to the World Trade Organisation. Commissioner, it is true that we still have certain reservations and differences. We in Parliament are asking for a transitional period of ten years whereas the Commission proposes six; we are asking for a tariff of “a minimum of EUR 300” whereas the Commission says “a maximum of EUR 300”. These are differences, it is true, but now we are talking a similar language, which is radically different to the one we have used for years.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, I am glad that you have increased your flow of information. Mr Schwaiger said during the previous debate that you should have information which further supplements all the different points of view on the problem. You recently visited the Azores and you have recently been in the Canary Islands and you undoubtedly have a fuller view of the problem, which is still very complex. For example, we feel bound to express our concern about banana production in certain ACP countries, in the small producing countries of the Caribbean and in certain countries of Western Africa, which have traditionally been suppliers to the banana market and to whom we have commitments that we cannot ignore.</p>
<p class="contents">Hurricane Mitch in Central America has unfortunately given us an example of what we find unacceptable. In certain countries – Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala – Mitch destroyed the banana plantations. Certain multinational companies, instead of contributing to the recovery of economic activity there, moved their business to other less affected areas and even to other countries, ignoring their obligations to thousands, or tens of thousands, of families and farmers who were on a wage of 10 dollars. This is not the model of development that we Europeans want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members have expressed their concern about the negative consequences suffered by certain sectors, especially in the United Kingdom, as a result of the devious measures applied by the United States, which I believe do not conform to the GATT agreements. We believe that the best way to help these companies is to find a way to resolve the conflict as soon as possible. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good idea to postpone this debate, as certain people have suggested over recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a complex and delicate balance on this issue. The Dary report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and also received the unanimous support of the committee on whose behalf I am speaking. I believe that the amendment tabled at the last minute by Mr Vatanen does nothing to help this issue, and I would ask him, if he is listening, to consider the possibility of withdrawing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate Mr Fernández, who has made such good use of his time to make us consider the fact that we have a series of commitments to fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dary report is a difficult and intricate piece of work which is worthy of praise, and has allowed us to unanimously approve a report on a truly complex issue. Commissioner, it is frankly no easy task to bring together the interests of consumers with those of producers, as well as respecting the European Union’s international commitments to the ACP countries and the Lomé commitments signed in Cotonou, and also to combine efforts in favour of the outermost regions, while respecting the GATT rules for third countries and safeguarding diversity in European Union supply and production.</p>
<p class="contents">The workings of the compromise that has been reached, which comes within the WTO rules, must be studied by the European Commission in a report which will have to be studied by Parliament within a reasonable time limit and, in accordance with the result of that report and the study made of it, the appropriate corrective measures will have to be proposed, as Mr Dary’s report suggests.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not opposed to the ‘tariff only’ system, Commissioner, we only wish, given these sudden changes, to take the necessary precautions when it comes to making the leap from one system to another. I therefore ask the Members of this House to endorse this report in its entirety, as did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I am not going to say again that amendments such as the only one tabled by a certain Member do not help to achieve this. I, like the previous speaker, therefore ask that this amendment be withdrawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the point of view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the situation is clear. The committee is in favour of the Commission’s proposal of maintaining the quota system by means of what is known as the “regatta” or the ‘first come, first served’ system, although, of course, it is not in agreement with the proposals aimed at the automatic transfer of the current quota system to a ‘tariff only’ system.</p>
<p class="contents">This conforms to the general philosophy adopted by this Parliament’s Agriculture Committee, which is that agriculture is not a normal industrial product and it is not therefore appropriate to apply generalised rules which are valid for industrial products. The recent ‘mad cow’ crisis, which is going to cost the European Community, its producers and consumers dearly, is an example of how agriculture cannot be reduced to the level of industrial production and marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to remind you that banana production is not alien to the Community. It is a form of production which takes place in a range of special Community regions, the outermost regions, which suffer a range of difficulties in competing in the markets and one of whose few products is precisely this one – the banana. As Mr Fernández Martín pointed out, Commissioner Fischler has recently been able to observe at first hand the state of the agricultural economy in these regions, which are so distant from the continental Community context.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the proposals in the Dary report, approved unanimously in the Agriculture Committee, refer to the need to take account of the structural problems of these outermost regions, which furthermore have a new legal basis in Article 299(2) of the European Community Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and which is currently awaiting the adoption of the relevant proposals by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group is therefore in favour of Mr Dary’s report and, of course, against Amendment No 36, presented by Mr Vatanen and other Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We seem to be faced with one series of proposals and counter-proposals after another, dealing with a transitional regime in which the Commission first proposes tariff rate quotas based on historical periods, reference periods, but then moves to a ‘first-come, first-served’ calculation. Meanwhile, the US first condemns historical reference periods but now advocates its own historical reference periods. It has become extremely difficult to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, amongst many others, I will not comment on the bulk of Mr Dary's report but will try and focus on one issue of principle. Whatever the transitional regime is – whether we go for a tariff rate quota and a licensing system which uses the so-called first-come-first-served system or the historical reference periods, whether it is before or after 1993 – we have to start accepting that this is a transitional regime which will at some point have to be replaced by a WTO-compatible ‘tariff only’ system. We cannot continue year in, year out to avoid our international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is why? Mr Dary suggested that if we were to move towards a ‘tariff only’ WTO system we would somehow be surrendering ourselves to chaotic commercial forces. The truth is quite the reverse. The WTO is a set of rules. It is actually an inhibition on chaos because it tries to institute rules which we all abide by. The European Union has an overwhelming strategic interest to ensure that those rules are reinforced and not weakened, because if we weaken the WTO or the rule of law, who will win? It will be the big guys like the United States; it will be might is right; it will be brute commercial force that will win through.</p>
<p class="contents">So I urge you, let us agree on what the transitional arrangement will be according to Mr Dary's report. But let us not turn our backs, as is suggested in Amendment No 11, on the idea that we must eventually move to a ‘tariff only’ system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am entirely in agreement with his aims. But unfortunately, Mr Dary, it is not in our power to insist on the fulfilment of our wishes. Strong forces are lined up against us. Not only do views differ between States within the European Union, which is reflected, as we all know, in the difficulties experienced by the Commission in its attempts to come up with a proposal on this matter; there is also the involvement of the World Trade Organisation. Powerful interests are at play, especially those of the Americans, who, although they are not banana-growers themselves, have invested American capital in the trading corporations. We are familiar with the issues, and our concern that the legitimate interests of the ACP countries, of the smaller banana-growers, will fall by the wayside is surely not unwarranted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to table amendments again as compromise motions. I hope that the Commission will now accept these amendments. Our main motive in tabling Amendment 35 is to ensure that the Commission reports to us on the impact of the proposed regime on the interests of the smaller banana-growers and on the ACP countries, so that, if there is to be a transition to a ‘tariff only’ system, we in Parliament shall have a basis on which to make a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certainly clear and has been confirmed by the Commission, namely that this will have to be dealt with again in Parliament. To that end, we shall need precise data. Perhaps by that time we shall have achieved codecision on matters of agricultural policy, because decisive moves were made at Nice in the direction of parliamentary codecision; we only have to ensure in the post-Nice discussions that these good intentions are put into practice. We shall most probably be in a more powerful position then, and this should be reflected in the banana report and in the objectives we lay down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the issues to which all the institutions have paid the closest attention. It is also important to point out that this issue, to my mind, has brought into conflict the interests of a couple of companies, represented by the United States, and those of the European Union, which was trying to protect the commitments given to its own farmers, and to the ACP countries. Frankly, I believe that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did the best it could, or what was within its power to do, in order to reach an agreement with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have accepted the use of the ‘first come, first served’ system, we have accepted a maximum reduction of the tariff preference of EUR 300 per tonne for the ACP countries, we have also tried to obtain guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises, and we have also asked the Commission for a report on the system’s impact. However, I believe that we can forecast negative effects on the smaller commercial operators and on producers in the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have serious doubts, although I do not like stereotypes, that an image of the European Union giving in to pressure from two multinationals, represented by the United States, will do no more than confirm preconceived ideas. It sometimes seems as though the Commission, in its proposals on deregulation in international trade and agricultural production, has gone even further than the Cairns Group. I agree with Mr Dary’s accurate words on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we must recognise that the regulations and Treaties lay down obligations and that acts of deregulation that may benefit certain companies will cost the Union’s budget dearly. In this regard I would like to express, not my agreement, but my amazement, at Mrs Schreyer’s statements yesterday on the agricultural budgetary context and the issue of bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by congratulating Mr Dary on his hard work, and the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the coordinators. My group will vote in favour of the report in the idea that if we drag this issue out we are going to make it very much worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A further 20% of these bananas are produced in ACP countries which also need this production for their development and with which we have entered into commitments which we ought to respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Each group of countries has been able to develop its production because we were offering them a market which we ought not now to take away from them. We should continue to have no problem about giving these producers the means to live by purchasing what they produce as a priority. It is only afterwards, for the remaining 60%, that we can open our doors to external producers on a free-trade basis. That was the thinking behind the COM in the banana sector, and that is the thinking behind our rapporteur, Mr Dary’s, counter-proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the banana producers of the dollar zone are appealing to the dogma of what they call the ‘intangible’ free-trade doctrine in order to impose a ‘tariff only’ system upon us should not either impress or intimidate us. Let us therefore remain as firmly committed to the particular cultivation method we favour as the Americans are to their protectionist system where sugar, tobacco, peanuts or dairy products are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We must hold fast, for if we give way today on the issue of bananas, why should we not give way tomorrow where the other common organisations of the market are concerned: on the CAP or European farm model advocating sustainable development? We ought to stick to our guns; otherwise, we shall lose all control over our food chain. In line with the same principles, we shall have GMOs, hormone-treated meat and social dumping foisted upon us. We must hold fast, and it is, rather, for the WTO to move on and to abandon its defensive, ‘tariff only’ fortress which is only too reminiscent of a profit only fortress.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘banana’ issue is an important milestone on the path of this necessary development for which the European Union should be working with all its might. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is proof of this effort that we are, for the second time, discussing a report that puts forward excellent proposals to make support of banana production in the EU and the ACP countries compatible with the WTO rules. It is a pity that the Commission and the Council still insist on a solution that may seriously jeopardise this production, particularly after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament I represent Madeira, a region where bananas are the main agricultural product. The same is true for other regions of the European Union, such as the Canaries and the French Overseas Departments. All these territories constitute outermost regions. These regions are not only among the most disadvantaged but are also the only ones where bananas are produced in the European Union. This situation has to be taken into consideration in the definition of the new rules for the banana import regime. The European agricultural model, based on the multifunctionality of farming, must also serve to safeguard European Union banana production. Of the many different functions of farming in my region, the one that is becoming increasingly important is environmental protection. In other words, the end of bananas in Madeira would be at least as serious from the economic viewpoint (serious collapse of income for thousands of producers) as from the environmental viewpoint (destruction of the subtropical landscape and the rural world, increased erosion).</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, without this important environmental side, Madeira would be totally unable to sustain its ‘goose that lays the golden eggs’, which is tourism. Why, then, liberalise in 2006 when the quota system is perfectly compatible with WTO rules, as well as being the best guarantee that banana production in the Community and ACP countries can be maintained? In spite of everything, I still hope that the Commission will take due account of Parliament’s opinion as set down in the report now being debated, which I fully support and which tomorrow we shall surely adopt. I conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Dary, on the excellent job he has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is almost impossible to reconcile the conflicting commercial interests and the dispute with the WTO, but the rapporteur and the committee Chairman have worked hard to produce a report which provides the Commission and the Council with a more realistic negotiating brief. I hope that the Commission will respond positively to the amendments, not with the blanket negative view of the last debate, and will acknowledge that each amendment represents legitimate concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already indications that the Commission's first-come-first-served proposals are easing the negotiating process and that past trading volumes may yet be an element in the final outcome. The dispute with the WTO has resulted in retaliatory trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in Member States who are affected in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors. Our objective must be to achieve a revised banana regime that will be accepted at the WTO and reflect the EU commitment to the ACP and the most vulnerable suppliers in the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="contents">Successive WTO rulings do not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers. The trick is how. The Commission must demonstrate that their needs will be addressed. It is not comfortable to accept the growth of trade liberalisation and a ‘tariff only’ system in the future, as the Commission has concluded, but it must be faced. The higher the tariff that can be negotiated, the less we will need other measures to help the ACP and the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that speeding up the negotiations gives the best guarantee of an acceptable tariff level, and for this reason, above all others, I call for full support for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dary, for the content of his report, since he is defending for the second time the maintenance of the quota system for banana imports into the European Union, thereby protecting Community production, and he rejects the automatic transfer to a ‘tariff only’ system, after a period of validity for the reformed COM which we believe should also be of ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for his desire his reach a compromise solution with the Commission. I would also like to thank the chairmen of the political groups in this Parliament who have accepted the stubbornness and obstinacy of the Members from the outermost regions so that this proposal for reform of the banana sector may be debated today in this House, and the mandatory opinion may be issued and can thereby arrive in time for the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which will take place in the coming days and we can therefore enter 2001 with a new reform of the COM in bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this COM will reflect the aspirations of the World Trade Organisation after so many years of trade disputes, as well as those of the Community producers. I trust that, with the passing of time, the system of distribution known as the ‘regatta’ system, in other words, ‘first come, first served’, may be accepted by the banana-producing countries.</p>

<p class="contents">Solving the current problem of the future of the common organisation of the market by means of an import regime based on a uniform tariff would entail a serious risk that banana prices would fall on the Community market, which would require an increase in compensatory aid given to producers in the outermost regions and entail a review of the Financial Perspective approved within Agenda 2000 for financing the common agricultural policy. It is therefore right that the Commission should continue not to insist on its proposals or banana production will disappear, with serious consequences on the social, economic and environmental fronts, as the rapporteur, Mr Dary, has pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, the transitional period should be about fifteen years, certainly not less than ten, and the compensatory aid should include guaranteed earnings for Community producers and a market for the produce of the outermost regions, and so aid should also be included for the bodies that market the bananas produced there.

Far too often in the past, the WTO has ruled against us. I represent industries in my Member State, the UK, which have fallen foul of US retaliatory action, where Mrs Barshefsky, the US trade secretary, has decided to impose 100% increases in import tariffs on Scottish companies. We have suffered losses in the cashmere industry.</p>
<p class="contents">When these companies in my Member State, in my constituency, were confronted with 100% import tariffs by the US, at one point it could have led to the closure of the cashmere industry in the Borders of Scotland, with a potential loss of 4000 jobs. We have another small company, Arran Aromatics, which exports the majority of its products to America. It has also been hit with retaliatory action by the US. It employs 50 people on a remote West Coast Scottish island and yet they are suffering from retaliation from the banana war, about which they know little and with which they have no connection whatsoever. This is deeply unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has been made in this debate of the apparent unanimity of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in supporting Mr Dary's report. I should say to you that there were many amendments put forward to Mr Dary's report in the Agriculture Committee which showed that there were deep divisions in that committee. We must not take that as evidence of unanimity in any way.

<p class="contents">Today, at the end of negotiations which looked like some sort of mug’s game and having accepted compromises devoid of substance, the Commission has, however, remained inflexible. I hope that it will listen to our arguments today, for this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, even if it were to amount to EUR 300, is in danger of proving completely useless in practice, for the ACP producers will be wiped out by the so-called ‘first come, first served’ system. This procedure is rightly termed a boat race since, as in such a race, it is the boat which makes all the difference. We already know which competitors will cross the line first: the multinationals with their high-performance equipment and refrigerated ships.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the United States and the majority of South American countries themselves reject this system. Why, then, does the Commission continue to defend such an unfair arrangement? Why not consider returning to the ‘historic references’ system to which the United States and the South American countries are now giving their overwhelming support? Otherwise, the ground rules could at least be modified in such a way as not to effectively exclude African producers. A two-round organisation, with the first round reserved for ACP producers when it comes to granting import licences for rating quota ‘C’, would therefore enable a balance to be restored. Where this issue is concerned, our ACP partners do not need charity, Commissioner. They just need us to join forces in order to defend our interests together.</p>
