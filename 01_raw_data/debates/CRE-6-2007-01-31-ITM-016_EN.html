<p class="contents">Mr President, never before has climate change been so prominent on the political agenda. The message from science is clear: climate change is happening. Citizens expect European Union leadership on this issue. The standard review and the Commission’s communication on post-2012 make the economic case for action. The risks of climate change far outweigh the costs of doing something about it. Following several natural events, notably the warm winter we are experiencing this year, there is a lively public debate about the threat of climate change. The European Union must use this political momentum to act. Now is the time for decisions on how to put Europe and the world on the path to a more energy-secure, low-carbon future.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency and scale of the climate change challenge requires Europe to further reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and convince its partners around the globe to do likewise. The European Union has the objective of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The climate change and energy package that the Commission put on the table on 10 January provides a blueprint for a European Union strategy to meet this objective. It sketches the basic elements of a global climate agreement post-2012 and gives a clear signal on the necessary level of ambition. This will encourage the start of negotiation on a post-2012 deal. The strength of this fully integrated package is that it demonstrates that further reducing the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions goes hand in hand with strengthening our competitiveness and the security of our energy supply. The credibility of the package is further underlined by the combination of concrete policy proposals to be adopted in 2007 or later.</p>
<p class="contents">We had the approval of our targets, which are very important. I can just remind you that about a year ago, we did not even talk about targets. We did not even think about unilateral commitments. About 15 months ago, the European Council had used the language ‘explore’ when giving the Commission the mandate: the mandate was to explore reduction pathways of 15 to 30% with other developed countries. Now we have a target to negotiate and we are asking the European Council to give us the mandate to negotiate a 30% target with other developed countries. On top of that we have a unilateral commitment, irrespective of the agreement and until such an agreement is reached, to reduce by 20%, which will enable us to achieve the other targets which we have set regarding energy efficiency, carbon dioxide emissions and energy security.</p>
<p class="contents">Other specific measures are also needed in order to achieve these targets. As regards the decisions that we are taking regarding the national allocation plans, I should like to point out that if we had accepted the proposed national allocation plans, the emissions trading system – which is the most important instrument to fight climate change – would have collapsed by now.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have reductions from specific sectors: aviation has been included in the European Union emissions trading scheme and will contribute its fair share in reducing emissions; cars should also make a fair contribution towards reducing the emissions which are increasing; the transport sector, as you know, is increasing carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union tremendously, so it has to make reductions too. The automobile industry should make the vehicle technology improvements which are needed in order to deliver on what the European Council told me to go for last June: 120g per kilometre by 2012.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today I am very glad to announce to you that we have adopted the fuel quality directive. This is the way to upgrade fuel requirements so they will be cleaner, emit less carbon dioxide and be better for the environment, better for health, better for fighting climate change. By 2020 we are going to save 500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. So, today’s decision was very important and is independent of the car proposal, which we have for next week, as the President announced today.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a series of other measures which are needed, otherwise it is just a lot of talk. If we make declarations that we are going to cut reductions by 2020 or by 2050, and then come to the particular measures which are needed in order to achieve this, and everybody says, ‘we are not responsible; we are a special case; the others should make the reductions’, we shall never achieve these targets. We need to be determined to fight climate change. In order to do this it is not only the Commission, it is not only the Council – and I should like to thank you very much for all the support you have given us so far – it is also the national authorities, not only the ministers, the governments, but all the authorities which are responsible for dealing with climate change cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes that developed countries – including the European Union – on average take on a 30% emission reduction target by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. In addition, the Commission has put forward a number of options for engaging developing countries with the aim of limiting the growth of their emissions and eventually reduce their emissions after 2020. The new targets for developed countries and tools to engage developing countries should form part of a new agreement to follow up from the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Obtaining such a new agreement will not be easy and will require firm European Union leadership. The Commission has proposed that the European Union demonstrate this leadership through a clear, independent commitment to achieve at least 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to 1990 levels, as I said previously. This independent commitment will help us break the deadlock in international climate negotiations. It underpins our strong determination to obtain an international agreement that will enable a 30% reduction to be made by developed countries and provide a strong message to our partners. It is feasible, it is affordable and it is profitable to take ambitious action. Now is the time to move from words to action. Independent unilateral commitment is also essential to meet our competitiveness and energy efficiency and energy security objectives. It ensures continuity of the carbon market and provides incentives to make investments in low-carbon technology for beyond 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Under European Union leadership, discussions in the United Nations framework are now increasingly shifting to issues of importance for an agreement on action post-2012. The Nairobi Climate Conference in November, whilst not making major headline-grabbing decisions, was in fact a step forward in terms of preparing the ground for a future agreement. For example, Nairobi saw agreement among parties to the Kyoto Protocol on a comprehensive work plan to be completed by 2008 or 2009 on further commitments of industrialised countries after 2012. There was a long sought-after agreement on conducting a comprehensive review of the Kyoto Protocol in 2008 and a series of important decisions on clean development mechanisms and adaptation. These will support developing countries in adapting to climate change and encourage more clean technology projects in Africa and other poorer regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Still, there is a large gap between talk and commitment to action. If we want an agreement within the next two to three years, the international community needs to show much more political will. Negotiations and commitments for developed countries and other contributions from developing countries need a kick start. This is precisely what the proposed 30% target and the 20% independent commitment is intended to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the Spring Council to send a strong signal on the need for determined action on climate change and the crucial link between energy policy and climate change – climate policy. I also expect the European Council to support the targets that I have just outlined to you.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope a similar message of support for the approach proposed by the Commission will be given by the European Parliament. We need this support to strengthen political momentum behind efforts to meet the two-degree objective, and we need the European Union to practice what it preaches in order to persuade other countries to do so too – among them the United States, which is the number one emitter in the world and which provides the argument behind which fast developing countries like China, India and other emerging economies in south-east Asia and South America can hide and say, ‘if the United States, which is number one emitter, is not moving, then why should we move?’. So in this way we shall show that we practice what we preach and we shall persuade them to follow in a global agreement, because climate change is a global threat and needs a global response.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sigmar Gabriel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, honourable Members, thank you very much for giving the new Presidency the opportunity to make a few comments on the subject of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by saying that we in the Council, in preparing the latest climate change conference, have arrived at common positions with the Commission and your House as regards the essential issues, strategies and responses to this global challenge. I believe that the only way we will have a chance of success over the coming years in negotiations that are currently proving difficult is if the European Union continues to speak with one voice and seeks to maintain its leadership role in the international negotiations on climate change. I am sure that the success of the past few years is accounted for by the European Union’s acceptance of this leadership role. Commissioner Dimas has just – and rightly – pointed out that the European Union, as well as having to set important goals for climate policy, does indeed face the question as to the extent to which it is prepared to give practical shape to these goals in the form of initiatives of its own and political practice at EU level and in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanity faces two challenges, and they are both truly great ones. The first great challenge to the human race is the question as to how the world – and its growing population – are to be provided with sufficient energy. Today, this planet of ours is home to 6.5 billion people, and there will, at some point, be over 9 billion of them. Today, 1.4 billion people live in industrialised regions, and the population of the industrialised nations on this planet will, in a few years and decades, reach 4 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">If, over the next fifty years, we want to consume energy and raw materials in the same way as we have done over the last half-century, we would need two planets in order to supply the human race with enough of these resources. The first question, then, that we have to answer if we want to make headway in the international negotiations on climate protection, is just how we can manage to secure the supply of energy, not only for ourselves, but also for the developing and emerging countries that are striving for economic growth in order to improve the conditions under which their people live.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europeans, and the other industrialised nations, do not manage to offer these countries technological answers as to how they can give their people economic growth, social security and prosperity without at the same time ruining the climate, then these countries will not join us in the search for ways of dealing with climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The first challenge, then, is to answer the question that is always the first to be asked of us by the developing countries at international negotiations on climate, and it is this: ‘How, then, do we supply the people – something like two billion of them – who, at present, have no access to electricity, who live in the direst poverty, and who need energy in order to improve the conditions under which they live?’ How, then, do we organise the supply of energy to this segment of the world’s population – consisting of two billion people – without at the same time upsetting the climate?</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge, then, for regions like Europe, that are technologically advanced, is to find out what are the technologies of the future, that will make possible economic growth and make it independent of the ruination of the climate and from ever-increasing emissions of CO2? It is high-tech regions like Europe that will have to provide the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The second – and related – challenge for the human race is how to limit climate change and global warming. This week, we will be getting our hands on the latest data from the ‘Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’, whose scientific members are at the moment meeting in Paris to exchange data. It is already clear that what we are going to be told is that all the menacing prognostications to do with global warming are more likely to be confirmed or to turn out to be understated than that things are going to get better, and that means that we are not going to succeed in keeping global warming below 2 degrees unless we manage to do more than we have done so far in helping to reduce the output of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is already apparent to us what the consequences of that are. In my own country, Germany, the last glacier will have ceased to be by 2020. A few months ago, we launched a new rescue vessel to rescue people from shipwrecks in the North Sea. It is almost 50 metres in length. Ten or 20 years ago, a length of between 20 and 30 metres would have been quite sufficient. These are the first indications of climate change in a country that is affected by it only to a relatively small extent.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there will, in Germany, be more flooding, but also more recorded droughts. We, though, are a relatively wealthy and secure country. We hear about rather more serious problems when we talk to our counterparts from Spain and Portugal, countries that live in fear of real desertification, of droughts amounting to more periods of water shortages, and things become even more unsettling when we take a look and see what global warming is already doing in Africa. </p>
<p class="contents">On the African continent today, there are already more refugees as a result of climate change than of war and civil warfare. The sort of movements of refugees that we see on the north African coast across the Mediterranean from Europe are just a hint of what is in store for us if global warming, and the destruction of living conditions in a continent like Africa, are not stopped in their tracks. </p>
<p class="contents">I might also add that this has a lot to do with justice. For crying out loud, it is an injustice that it should be the continent of Africa, which bears no responsibility for the climate change that is currently going on, that should most have to suffer from the consequences of it, and that is what we are already seeing happening. </p>
<p class="contents">I ask you to imagine a state of affairs in which four billion of the world’s population live in industrialised societies – two-thirds of them in Asia, by the way – and global warming begins to have an effect on the glaciers of the Himalayas, the source of 40% of Asia’s fresh water. I ask you to imagine what sort of threats the world faces when these reserves of drinkable water in Asia start to disappear; we will face the prospect of wars being fought not only for oil, but also, conceivably, of wars and civil wars being fought to gain possession of reservoirs of water. </p>
<p class="contents">We are talking, then, about a real threat to the human race, but we must first succeed in getting these debates about the challenges to humanity out from the specialist arenas and into the forums of world leaders. In future, it will not be enough to bring together 189 environmental ministers from the United Nations and 5 000 scientists to discuss climate change at an international conference once a year; on the contrary, these issues will have to be discussed by Heads of State or Government, the UN General Assembly and the Security Council as well. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also a member of the German <span class="italic">Bundestag</span>, in other words, of a parliament. We must succeed in getting these issues put high up on the agenda for parliamentary debates. I have to be frank and say that, when compared with the number of your House’s Members who turn up for debates on climate change, the number of their counterparts who do so in the <span class="italic">Bundestag </span>is more likely to be lower than higher.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also make it our business to ensure that our constantly telling the public and our constantly reading, that this is one of the greatest challenges that the human race has to contend with, actually has the effect of making us focus our political action on it and prioritising it as part of our day-to-day work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the Commission’s proposals in respect of energy and climate management show not only that it has recognised this as a task, but also that it has thereby been given an historic opportunity. For the first time in the debate about energy and climate change, the Commission has made a proposal that I see as constituting an historic opportunity, in bringing together the themes of secure energy supply and the management of climate change. No longer are we debating the questions of how we are to guarantee access to energy, on the one hand, and how to safeguard our climate, on the other, in separate spheres, but instead have a package of proposals and policy instruments on the table that deals with both issues together. </p>
<p class="contents">We have, for the first time, the opportunity to decide issues of energy policy and climate change together, at the European level, and in a coherent concept. I know that there will, over the coming weeks and months, be much discussion in the committees, the working parties and in officials' negotiations, and you know that far better than I do, for you have more experience of European decision-making processes than I do.</p>
<p class="contents">My friend Mr Schulz – and it is worth the journey here just to have the chance of speaking before him, for normally our roles are reversed – knows, or at any rate he told me so earlier on, that there is always the risk of the political dynamic – what I would call the historic opportunity – being lost in amidst such discussions about details. What will, I believe, be the essential thing over the coming weeks and months will be that we do not, with all the necessary discussions of detail going on, miss this historic opportunity to combine Europe’s policies on energy and climate change and use them to map out the path for international debate to take. I see that as being the real task of the politicians in the Commission, Parliament, and in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There will of course be a number of points of detail where differences relating to national interests have to be settled, as is currently evident from the example of the motor industry, but what must be of the essence is that we should seize this historic opportunity, and I want, on behalf of the Council, to give a couple of examples to highlight what is going to be of particular importance at the spring summit of Heads of State or Government. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the international negotiations need to have ambitious climate protection targets in mind; it is absolutely right that the Commission should set itself, as a goal for the international negotiations, a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020, a figure arrived at not by reference to what we are confident of achieving or to what is economically feasible, but solely by reference to the reductions we have to achieve by 2020 in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees. I think that is something that has to feature more prominently in day-to-day political debate, for there is often one great problem that one has to face in the debate on climate change. </p>
<p class="contents">Back in the 1970s and 1980s, when people in my own country had problems with rubbish and waste dumps, the poisonous substances seeping out of the dumps were visible; it was because people could smell them and see them day in and day out that the politicians who dealt with day-to-day political issues got together and decided that the dumps had to be cleared up and less waste had to be added to them. </p>
<p class="contents">The atmosphere is a dumping ground; although, nobody sees it, one does not smell it – at least not every day – and thank heaven disasters are not a daily occurrence. There is a quite considerable likelihood of the fact of this dump’s invisibility not reminding us, on a daily basis, of the need for action, and if you tell the people, your electorate, that we want to limit the temperature increase on our planet to 2 degrees, many of them will look at you in amazement and say, ‘Two degrees? That is not really very much, and it is actually very pleasant if it does not get quite so cold in Northern Europe’. In other words, it is difficult to communicate the fact that a mere two or three degrees is the difference between our present-day temperatures and the Ice Age several thousand years ago. </p>
<p class="contents">And, if you then tell them that we have to get it all done by 2100, for there will by then be a lot of people on this planet, you will hear them say, in our parliaments and parties, ‘oh well, that is looking so far ahead; that is something for our successors to bother themselves about’. </p>
<p class="contents">It has to be spelled out that climate change is something that is already happening and that, in essence, it is our children and grandchildren who are going to be affected by it. All of those who are of my age and currently actively involved in politics will certainly be able to live out their lives on this earth, but my 18-year old daughter will pay a heavy price if we fail to make use of the next 10 to 15 years in order to bring about real change in global warming or to stop it altogether. Protecting the climate involves a long braking distance; it lasts thirty years. It is in thirty years time that we will reap the fruits of what we do properly now, but it is our children and grandchildren who will suffer the consequences of what we get wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that we lay down the 2-degree target at the Spring Summit of Heads of State or Government, thus arriving at an international climate protection target of minus 30% by 2020. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has said that, if a multilateral agreement or an agreement supplementary to Kyoto is not reached with the United States, China and India, the European Union should set a unilateral target of at least 20%. Some political figures have said that they see that as a retrograde step in managing climate change; I see it as something quite different. The message we are sending out is that, even in the improbable eventuality of our not succeeding in bringing about an international agreement on climate change involving those beyond the EU’s borders, nobody in the EU should believe that that would be the end of climate protection; on the contrary, even in the eventuality – one that we neither expect nor desire – of international negotiations on climate change failing, our concern will be to commit the European Union to more climate protection and to achieve at least 20%, rather than contenting ourselves with 8%. </p>
<p class="contents">We want the agreement to apply also to air transport, and we do of course need the European motor industry’s voluntary undertaking to be put into practice. If a voluntary undertaking naming 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre on average is not forthcoming from the European motor industry, the political fallout will not be about the question of whether or not legislation is needed at the European level; rather, it seems to me, having heard what I have heard over recent days, that we – the Commission, my government, and the overwhelming majority in the Council and this House – are agreed on the fact that European legislation is needed to secure this contribution from the European motor industry, a contribution of 120 grams per kilometre. </p>
<p class="contents">What we will have to hammer out is whether that can be achieved through vehicle technology alone or whether we want to avail ourselves of, for example, proportionate incorporation of biofuels as a means towards that end. This is certainly, I believe, a fit subject for debate here in your House, in the Commission and at Council level, but there should be no doubt about the fact that the ultimate objective is the 120 gram target for the motor industry across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will have to make sure that everyone makes progress towards this target – large vehicles no less than medium-sized ones or small ones, and renewable energies need to be developed to a considerable degree. Speaking both for myself and for the Council, I am very keen that we should stick with the across-the-board target of 20% of the EU’s primary energy needs being met from renewable energies, and prove that we can thereby become technological leaders. These climate change objectives are ambitious, but there are also massive prospects for the European Union’s economic growth, for job creation and for education. </p>
<p class="contents">After all, the question has to do with what is to become of Europe when China is the world’s workbench, Russia its petrol pump and Brazil its farmer – what will Europe be then? I believe that we in Europe will be the world’s engineers and technologists, the ones who take on the technological challenges and offer solutions whereby the issues of energy supply and climate change can be addressed, technological answers that many are waiting for the climate change talks and international energy policy to supply. It is in the region of Europe that innovation happens and Europe that possesses everything that is needed in order to provide these answers. I believe that what the Commission has put forward in matters of efficiency, climate protection targets and its energy action plan provides us with everything we need to face up to this challenge.</p>

That was said, not by me, but by the President of the European Council, Chancellor Merkel, here in this House a fortnight ago, and so the Commission and the Presidency are only being consistent when they prioritise the battle against climate change as part of their work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that it is no less important that such words be backed up by action. As the Stern report made clear, the economic damage done by uncontrolled climate change is comparable, economically speaking, only with that done in the course of the Second World War. In my electoral district, we have a tangible example of this, one that people talk about, for we experienced the storm ‘Kyrill’, which caused thousands of people to sustain serious losses, since my electoral district was at its epicentre. Although climate change cannot be blamed for every storm, the researchers are pretty certain that the accumulation of extreme meteorological occurrences can no longer be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our aim must be to reduce emissions by 30% by the year 2020; we should do everything possible to that end. Like many other Members of this House, I do believe that talking in terms of 20% was – to say the least – confusing, for the impression was conveyed that the 20% figure was not to be taken too seriously, yet seriously is just how we should take it.</p>
<p class="contents">We now also have the chance to get something done about this at the international level, for in the USA, for example, the debate has undergone fundamental change in the aftermath of Katrina. After what has happened over the last few months, we have a far greater chance than in the past of doing something about it together, so, realistically, nobody should take it for granted that we will get nowhere; instead, we should do everything possible to actually get an international agreement in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that this House should be preparing a response to the Commission’s statement, but it is also good that we are not voting on it as early as tomorrow, for there is a resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in which there is much sense; even so, we still have to haggle over it if we are to be able, in Strasbourg, and with the agreement of the other committees, to be able to respond with the utmost clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for example, take the view that the Committee on Environment’s resolution’s treatment of nuclear energy is quite irrelevant and very poor; that is not fit for purpose and there is room for us to make some improvements there, but what we must do is to send out a clear signal in favour of more being done to handle climate change. According to one survey, that is what 98% of people expect Europe’s policymakers to do, and we should not disappoint them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since Mr Gabriel has gone into these details, I will not mention them. We will try to further improve this resolution in Strasbourg, with a view to the Spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to devote the few seconds available to me to supporting what I consider to be a very good starting point from Mr Gabriel’s speech, which is that we are faced with a turning point in history. I believe that, during this year and next, 2007 and 2008, it will be possible to actually say whether, politically speaking, we are going to succeed in speeding up and making a qualitative leap on this major theme that is commanding international attention. The situation is changing, not only in terms of the new data being supplied to us by the scientists in Paris, the panel, etc., but also in terms of the political and international debate: for example, a different sort of awareness is developing or may develop on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that, while playing our part and introducing appropriate legislation – emissions trading, the inclusion of aviation, the reduction in CO2 emissions for cars, and all the other things in the pipeline – we need to make a big qualitative leap in political terms and create a powerful alliance among the European institutions so that they can present themselves as strongly as possible in international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We too, as Parliament, ought perhaps to do our jobs better – clearly, first and foremost, that of legislator – but we can support the Commission and Council negotiations by perhaps proposing a major international alliance of parliaments, with a view to making the fight against global warming a real priority, as the citizens are demanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that together these represent an ambitious but not unachievable policy. Such a policy is essential if the Union and its Member States are to live up to their responsibility to citizens, if we are to enjoy secure energy supplies and if we are to persuade other countries to follow our example.</p>
<p class="contents">If we had heeded the warnings of Californian scientists in the late 1970s, we could probably have prevented climate change. Now we can hope only to contain it. For that reason, Liberals and Democrats deplore the pleadings of German car manufacturers in <span class="italic">Bild Zeitung</span> and the attempts by some Commissioners to water down emissions targets.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If the Japanese can make hybrid cars, if the French and the Italians can produce cars that are far more efficient, why cannot others as well?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not often quote Konrad Adenauer in this House – I leave that to my colleagues on the right – but Adenauer was pertinent when he said ‘God placed limits on man’s reason. But not on his stupidity’.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We will not succeed unless our citizens recognise there is a problem and start changing their habits. Do we really need electric razors or electric curling irons? Do we really need cars that go from 0 to 100 km per hour in less than six seconds if it will destroy our planet in less than six decades? There is a boast of car manufacturers that their cars do 240 km per hour. That may be so, but they emit 360g of CO2 for each kilometre. Stopping this is not hitting jobs. A Belgian Government study last year showed that cutting CO2 emissions has no overall effect on jobs, because there are new high-tech sectors which create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just on climate issues where new thinking is needed: we need to feed a rapidly growing world population and bring living standards up to the point where population numbers stabilise. There are many ways to do that – growing soya, for example, with the same nutritional value as beef for less than 1% of the inputs.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy can no longer be run by crisis management, where serious problems are left untackled until there is a crisis. Where livelihoods and the sustainability of life are at stake, we need a purposeful, proactive approach to our politics, such as that suggested by the President-in-Office today. It is not easy to change people’s habits. There is not enough emphasis in the Commission’s proposals on cutting energy use, but it is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">HG Wells said ‘human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe’. If the Commission grasps this agenda, if it challenges the Member States rather than deferring to them, then there is hope that the Union will yet command greater support among our citizens.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission proposal accompanying the energy package is problematic, and not only because of the 20% target and the juggling around with the initial unilateral 20% followed perhaps by 30% at the international level later; another reason why it is problematic is that the instruments to be included in this energy package are all too weak, and I have my doubts about whether they are at all capable of achieving a 20% reduction in CO2.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gabriel, this is a package with a lot wrong with it and little right with it. For example, there is too little in it about energy efficiency and energy-saving, not enough about renewable energies, too much about coal and fossil fuels, and the optimistic attitude in it towards nuclear power is indefensible nowadays, particularly when one considers the economic disaster that Areva is inflicting on Finland, the news of which must surely make every opponent of nuclear power rejoice that the nuclear industry is ruining itself through this sort of misinvestment.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the rights and wrongs of this, there has, as I see it, also been something over the past few days that has outdone these false instruments, something for which the German Presidency of the Council is responsible. Commissioner Dimas tried – and rightly – to lay down binding targets for CO2 reduction, and at a level that the motor industry had voluntarily announced, only to see this proper attempt torpedoed by Germany, and not with the thought in its mind of doing something about climate change or the future of the motor industry, but simply and solely with the thought of protecting that small subdivision of it – the one concerned with the production of big luxury cars, a business that goes on in Germany, and so, suddenly, they care less about climate change and only about Porsche!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Francis Wurtz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, I am glad we are having this debate at the same time as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose conclusions we all look forward to, is being held in Paris. In this regard, Madam President, may I suggest that we invite Dr Pachauri, chairman of the panel, which comprises the world’s most eminent scientists dealing with this issue, to attend a public hearing in this Chamber. I met him briefly yesterday in Paris and I believe that his explanations and recommendations would be very useful in the battle ahead of us if we intend to help overcome this challenge to civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the current state of play? I would personally say that we must send out a message to our citizens that is both lucid and stimulating, one that consists of one piece of bad news and two pieces of good news. The bad news is the current state of affairs. Around the world, the situation has become even worse over the past six years, and in the EU we have got off to a bad start in honouring our Kyoto commitments, which were woefully inadequate to start with. If we were to continue at this rate, we would do the planet intolerable damage not only for future generations but for our children’s generation, too. So much for the bad news, which certainly is bad.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the first piece of good news: it is possible to reverse the trend.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Addressing Members who are talking and not listening to him)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if the issue of climate change only interests you in front of the media, then I feel sorry for you …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… because just before, when the Council and the Commission were talking about it, I counted you, and there were no more than 50 Members in the Chamber. Please do not come just to vote without knowing the background. Come and take part in the debate, or at least show some respect for those who are speaking.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Having mentioned the bad news, here is the first piece of good news that we can announce to the citizens. It is possible to reverse the trend, but this would admittedly require something akin to a revolution. The objectives of reducing emissions are well known – a reduction of 50% around the world, and thus 75% in our countries, by 2050. To achieve this will entail not only substantial increases in clean energy sources but also a new relationship as regards energy efficiency, involving a massive upsurge in the development of railways and motorways of the sea, the implementation, as mentioned by other speakers, of ambitious anti-pollution standards on car manufacturers, in spite of the pressure from Mrs Merkel, the massive construction of energy-saving houses, training in the use of more fuel-efficient technologies, international trade based much more on cooperation than competition, massive long-term investment and the adoption of the notion of the common good, in other words a number of major setbacks for liberal globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the second piece of good news, namely the sharp increase in public awareness of these issues, including in the United States and emerging countries. This historic gamble has no chance of paying off unless that fundamental element is in place. One word of warning, however: I doubt whether the citizens would accept a Malthusian response to the problems we face. Leaving behind the preoccupation with economic productivity does not mean hampering social development. The fight against climate change will not be a smooth process.</p>

I would like to ask you, as the newly-elected President of this House, to ask the reform commission that is supposed to be discussing reform of the way Parliament works, to give us something that we need, namely a procedure that treats speakers with greater fairness than they are at present.</p>
<p class="contents">When there is no break between the debate and the voting time, the last speakers on the voting list end up in the position that my friend Mr Wurtz has just been in, that of trying to do the impossible in speaking against the background of a Chamber into which hundreds of Members are streaming, none of whom are listening to what is being said because they all have something important to discuss among themselves. That is quite simply unacceptable, and I would ask you to see to it that there is a gap after the end of a debate and before the voting takes place, so that we avoid undignified situations like the one we have just experienced, with the chairman of a group having to fight for the floor, simply because the Members are not listening. That is simply not acceptable.</p>
