<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I am wearing several hats this morning, so I apologise for the confusion. First of all, on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, I should like formally to move the oral question, the subject of which is the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention. Specifically, what are the key strategic objectives for the European Union at the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora – CITES – to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2 to 14 October 2004? I am also here in the absence of Mr John Bowis, our coordinator, and would like to include my contribution on behalf of the PPE-DE Group while I am on my feet, rather than speaking again after the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">CITES is a global conservation agreement on trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, which is implemented in the EU through the even stricter EU wildlife trade regulations. However, there is an urgent need for greater cooperation between the 25 Member States' enforcement agencies, especially now that our land borders, post-enlargement, have increased by over one third to more than 3 000 km and also because of the acknowledged links between the significant, though unquantified, illegal wildlife trade and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Enforcement Group, which has been set up under Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97, needs to be revisited somewhat urgently. It needs to be made much more effective: we need systematic compilation on the illegal wildlife trade to determine the numbers of seizures and confiscations. This must all be put on a database, so that information can be shared by all enforcement officers throughout the EU. I underline my concerns and those of my Group on the lack of proper enforcement and assistance to the enforcement agencies in this particularly important area.</p>
<p class="contents">CITES regulates trade in some 30 000 species of plants and animals. The EU is a major legal market. Over the five years up to 2001, for example, imports into the EU have included 5.4 million live birds, equal to 87% of global trade, with Portugal and Spain being the main importers; over one million live reptiles, equal to 16% of global trade, with Spain and Germany being the main importers; seven million live cacti and 15 million live orchids, mainly going to the Netherlands; and 383 tonnes of sturgeon caviar, 40% of the global trade, which went mainly to France and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2004, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the Community position, to be adopted on certain proposals submitted to the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention. This proposal has been discussed at a number of meetings of the Working Party on International Environment Issues, which is made up of scientific and management experts from Member States. I understand the final meeting is to take place today. It would have been useful if we had known the outcome of the final meeting before this debate, but unfortunately I do not have any information from it and it is probably not possible to obtain it.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the CITES itself, Appendix I is reserved for the most critically endangered species. International commercial trade in wild-taken specimens of these species is prohibited in Appendix I.</p>
<p class="contents">Appendix II contains most of the species regulated by the Commission. Regulated commercial trade in these species is allowed, however, such trade must not be detrimental to the survival of the species concerned. It is really only Appendix I and Appendix II that require the sanction of the Conference of the Parties in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to some of the specific points in the resolution before us, which I largely welcome, although I find it rather long and verbose. However, I fully support the resolution, as does the PPE-DE Group, with perhaps a couple of caveats. First of all, the PPE-DE Group will be having a free vote on paragraph 3, as requested. I will be supporting paragraph 3 myself and will be indicating this to my Group, but there are those who have concerns about it. Likewise, our Group will have a free vote on paragraph 7, indent 1, on African lions. I will be voting against that and I will explain why in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to paragraph 5, I need guidance from the Commission. It welcomes an Australian proposal to list the great white shark in Appendix II of CITES with a zero quota on precautionary principle grounds. I understand, and I would like it confirmed, that the proposers – the Australians – have now withdrawn the proposal for a zero quota. As it stands in our resolution, therefore, it may not make sense. Perhaps we should finish the point by welcoming the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES, Appendix II, full stop. Others may make the case for reintroducing a zero quota if they wish, but as it stands, it makes no sense.</p>
<p class="contents">On the great white shark issue, the Community has generally supported the Appendix II listing, but rejected the zero quota on legal and scientific grounds. While I support the precautionary principle, I do not support a 'preventionary' principle. Generally, I believe in rewarding those states that have made tremendous efforts in the area of conservation. What we do must not dilute the credibility of CITES itself. Any decisions we take, even as a Parliament, apart from what the Commission and others might decide, must be scientifically grounded to ensure the credibility of CITES. That is the general thrust of the position we have taken in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies very strongly to the points on the black rhinoceros and the leopard. The proposal on the African lion is scientifically weak and is strongly opposed by the range states where the lion population is stable or increasing. I have an open position on this. I hope that we can find a compromise solution with the range states. However, we must not erode the credibility of the Convention by supporting scientifically weak proposals on this. Although it is a free vote, I will be recommending that we vote against, in the hope that a compromise will be found in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Irrawaddy dolphin, I recognise that the proposal has some merit. I am leaning in favour of it, but the scientific and practical doubts remain. Again, I hope that, on the basis of sound scientific principle and with proper use of the precautionary principle, which is not a 'preventionary' principle, we will be able to look after endangered species as we should. The rest of the world will follow what the EU-25 does at the Conference of the Parties. It is not just our 25 votes, but the other votes that we will attract from among the 166 parties voting on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am pleased to inform you that preparations in Council have proceeded smoothly and we have already reached a consensus. In doing so, our position on some high-profile issues has evolved. For example, we are now leaning in favour of the proposal to outlaw commercial trade in the Irrawaddy dolphin.</p>
<p class="contents">CITES has been in force for nearly 30 years and has proved a very effective tool in reducing the threats to wild fauna and flora posed by unsustainable international trade. Since its entry into force, other agreements relating to biodiversity have been adopted, most notably the Convention on Biological Diversity. One of the Community's strategic objectives is to achieve greater synergies between these agreements, thereby contributing to a significant reduction in the rate of loss of biological diversity by 2010, as endorsed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community also believes that CITES should remain a vehicle for the sustainable use of wild fauna and flora. Increased protection is often required to safeguard the conservation status of some species in trade, but we must also acknowledge the efforts of those countries that have already implemented effective conservation measures. For this reason, we have to consider seriously the proposals for easing trade restrictions on some species, such as the Christmas orchid from Colombia, black and white rhinos, the leopard, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">CITES is a science-based convention, as has already been underlined, and sets out detailed criteria for determining the level of protection that should apply to individual species. The Community supports this science-based approach and therefore is hesitant about the proposals concerning the African lion and endemic reptiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Community wishes to maximise the efficiency of CITES by minimising unnecessary administrative burdens. While we must avoid illegal or unsustainable trade, we should also ensure that parties' resources are directed towards issues of real conservation concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with its recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the Convention divides protected species into different categories of commercial exploitation, it provides a sufficiently versatile tool for keeping problems in check. The proposal before us now will in some cases mean protection will be more rigid, while in some cases it will be slacker. Both of these gestures are appropriate and justified, and they reflect a balanced, scientific perspective. A few icons of animal protection, such as the classic bald-headed eagle, will be moved from the total-ban category to one of tightly controlled trade. It may be interpreted as an encouraging sign that the fact that it was an icon proved useful. Certain protected species have begun to recover. A sound basis on which to proceed is scientific evidence: the content of the appendices can be made more stringent or more relaxed if the scientific evidence suggests there is a need to make it so. The all-important issue is not strictness, but sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless important that it should be harder to relax the rules than tighten them up. The reason is that the stakes are very high indeed: we are gambling with nature, which will not be recovered if it is lost. For that reason it is vital that the precautionary principle is still cited as a basic tenet; this, despite the fact that, to the ears of many of my colleagues and associates, that phrase sounds flat and empty, as the use of the phrase ‘the precautionary principle’ has not always meant that the principle has been followed. Now, however, the phrase is apt.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the scope of the CITES Convention is only restricted to trade, perhaps models for further international environmental agreements could also be found by analysing it. At the same time, we have to remember the concern raised in the resolution and focus more attention on the monitoring of implementation. The EU is unfortunately one of the largest markets for the illegal trade in wild animals and plants.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Scheele (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Doyle has just said when putting our written question to the Commission, this position statement affects not only the 25 Member States of the European Union, but is also a signal to the remainder of the 166 states that have signed up to CITES, known also as the Washington Agreement on the Protection of Species. That is what makes it important that we in this House should send out a clear signal. At present, the Agreement on the Protection of Species applies to some 30 000 species. We know that, beside the destruction of their habitats, international trade is the greatest threat to the survival of many endangered species. That is what makes CITES necessary, and that is why I have been heartened by many of the positions taken by the Commission, which, at the conference of states party to the Convention, is speaking out loud and clear in favour of strict restrictions on trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Korhola said that she sees it as being very, very important that all decisions should be founded on the precautionary principle. Discussion of this oral question, and also of today’s resolution, has been dominated by two issues, one being the protection of minke whales and the other the trade in ivory. It is no secret that Japan wants to reintroduce commercial whaling and is working towards it. It did not manage to get its position accepted at the last meeting of the International Whaling Commission in July 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the European Union and its Member States to reject Japan’s demand that three types of minke whales be transferred from Appendix I to Appendix II and hence also to unambiguously retain a higher standard of protection for the whales.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution constitutes a clear demonstration by this House that we welcome the call by Kenya and other African states for the introduction of a 20-year moratorium on trade in ivory. Between 1980 and 1989, the number of African elephants dropped dramatically, from 1.2 million to 600 000 and halved again by 2001 to 300 000, a rapid decline explained largely by the demand for ivory. The former system of quotas for ivory exports from specified countries did not work, as demand is so great that enormous quantities are smuggled out illegally. For consumers and for those who monitor the trade, the situation is highly confusing, but it is a very agreeable one for those who want to smuggle ivory illegally. Over and over again, ivory is seized at our European airports because the documentation does not conform to what is required under the Agreement on the Protection of Species. Supplying, with intent to deceive, false information on customs declarations and CITES approval forms is widespread in the illegal trade in wild animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we also started considering the issue of African lions. My group wants item 7, as it stands in the resolution, to be retained. It is clear from the information we have about the threat to the African lion that there has been a dramatic reduction in their numbers over recent years, and so I am very glad to see the Commission take up a clear position on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad she is not going to be leaving us.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the enormity of problems concerning the environment, she once said that we cannot cry about everything all the time. That is very true, but, when we consider how we are diminishing life on this planet, it is certainly worth at least some tears.</p>
<p class="contents">Virtually no animal on this planet can exist without the agreement of humans. We are the dominant species. If animals are to survive, they do so because we allow them to do so, because there is no economic incentive to kill them or because we actively want them to survive. In nearly all cases, habitats have to be managed and somehow protected. This is how mankind now manages the natural order. The pity is that we are terrible managers. We cannot see beyond the present: we think everything is still there for the taking and need not consider the consequences. We preside over one of the world's great periods of extinction.</p>
<p class="contents">Within a generation we have wiped out a vast proportion of the animals of Africa and now we are doing the same to the seas. Shark numbers in many cases are said to have dropped by 90% since Spielberg's film 'Jaws' was released. The great white shark is the ocean's top predator, the lion of the seas. To lose a creature that has changed very little in tens of millions of years would not only be a tragedy but would further change the ecology of the waters, upsetting a balance already damaged by over-fishing and certainly entailing damaging consequences. Trade in its parts must be curtailed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the issue of land animals in Africa highlights the complexities involved in securing solutions. We know there has been a huge loss in elephant numbers, much of which is attributable to poaching. However, curtailing the ivory trade seems to have been successful in preventing a complete wipe-out. Yet the picture is mixed: elephant numbers are recovering in some areas, but this causes the destruction of the natural habitat. As the government of Botswana pointed out in a very well argued paper, numbers have to be managed if the competing demands of people, vegetation and habitats are to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I have no objection to increasing the trade in ivory selectively, provided that the money raised is for conservation purposes. For the same reasons I have no objection in principle to trophy hunting, although I cannot understand the mentality of rich people who want to kill great creatures. My concern is that the money will not be spent in this way and that the increase in the ivory trade will stimulate poaching everywhere, with catastrophic results.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Member States will stand firm and support a total ban, but they should also be realistic and accommodating. If we in Europe want to deny poor nations the right to sell harvested ivory legitimately and sustainably, should we not be contributing financially to meet our desires and their needs? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would very much like all Members to vote for it as it stands. Our message is of course also directed to the Council, which is not present, and this is a pity as it is the Council which will represent us in Bangkok. We are also inviting the Commission to comply with this resolution, which will reflect the voice of the peoples of Europe during the final votes in Bangkok.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution calls for better protection of endangered species, and follows on from the most forceful measures taken in the fight against the decline of wild fauna and flora. We are all aware, and it has already been noted by a number of Members, that all possible steps should be taken to support every initiative aimed at saving species which can still be saved, because nature continues to be destroyed at a breathtaking speed.</p>
<p class="contents">Having followed the work carried out in this House on an action plan for biodiversity conservation and on the Convention on Biological Diversity, I can state that biodiversity obviously remains the poor relation among our environmental policies. I would even go so far as to say that this is undoubtedly the weak link of sustainable development. We are aware that, as the 25 Member States of the European Union, we are the largest consumers of wild species. Mrs Doyle has drawn up a list, and it is truly horrifying; millions of species are taken from their habitats around the world for our pleasure alone, not for our survival but for our pleasure alone. Legal trade in species is an enormous market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore easy to imagine the volume of illegal trade, and indeed some say that its value is equal to that of drug trafficking. This would explain the problems encountered in implementing more stringent protection measures for certain species. Be that as it may, we are calling unanimously for the precautionary principle to be adopted as a basic rule for all decisions taken in the framework of CITES.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take as an example the white shark, made famous by the film ‘Jaws’. This is a perfect illustration, as we are well aware of how difficult it is to carry out studies on this animal. Given that this species is endangered, we are therefore calling for a zero quota in the name of the precautionary principle, and this is why we continue to support this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The 20-year moratorium on all ivory trading proposed by Kenya, and supported by 12 countries which are also home to a large number of African elephants, needs our support. As the world expert on elephants, Professor Pfeffer, has said for many years, legal trade in an endangered species has the immediate effect of reviving illegal trade in the species. We know that it is the survival of a species which is at stake, and the 12 African countries concerned have also realised this. As European countries, we should therefore support this position, and we must also support the transfer of the lion from Appendix 2 to Appendix 1. Why? Because, Mr President, we, as Europeans, are going on holiday and hunting the male lion, which contributes to the destruction of this species on a global scale.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for all these reasons that we should support these proposals, and I would ask you, Mr President, to allow me to say something on the issue of secrecy, which is an extremely important issue. We have discussed this issue in committee, and we cannot accept a vote by secret ballot when putting final resolutions to the vote. Such a practice would leave the door open to all kinds of bargaining, and out of respect for the Member States’ commitments and for our own principles, a transparent decision-making process should remain the golden rule in international conventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should, however, like the Commission to clarify the position to be adopted by the EU in these negotiations with regard to two points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the issue of secret ballots. There is now a debate about not having open votes with due reporting of the way in which countries vote on a number of positions. I think that, if it is to be possible to demand political accountability, it is absolutely crucial that countries be answerable for the way in which they vote on this convention. Can we rely upon the EU doing everything in its power to oppose the holding of secret ballots in these votes? That is my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is a special one concerning the protection of the great white shark. On this issue, there appears to be a consensus to the effect that a higher level of protection is required, but I believe that, given the uncertainties that exist concerning what stocks remain, the demand for a zero quota for export is extremely sensible on the grounds of the precautionary principle. I wonder if we can rely upon the EU also supporting the demand for a zero quota for export. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our primary goal is the conservation of nature, which in the first place means protection of the environment, in other words, the maintenance of the ecological balance. Secondarily, it means protecting the diversity of species, which is precious and at risk. Thirdly, it means protecting animals, both as regards the trade in them, the protection of their natural habitats, and, of course, the ways in which people keep animals. For that reason, I believe that we have to take a very nuanced approach to the trade in animals, as Mr Davies, for one, has done.</p>
<p class="contents">There must of course be restrictions to prevent the extermination of endangered animal species, but there are species that would have disappeared without the trade in animals, without their being bred in zoos, and that would have disappeared had they not been preserved for future generations outside their original areas, which have been ravaged by such things as war, civil strife and natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me make it abundantly clear that I am in favour of this resolution, whilst believing that this is where we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater; I believe it to be obvious and reasonable that the trade in animals should continue to be engaged in within certain tight and restrictive parameters. Our zoos are doing great things; our geozoo in Munich, for example, has bred very valuable species that would otherwise have disappeared from the face of the earth. For that reason, it is crucial that we take a measured approach to this. When it comes, though, to such things as elephants and the trade in ivory, or the trade in rhinoceros horn and much else, that is where we have to take very tough action; on that I agree absolutely with my fellow Members. As Mrs Isler Béguin said, it is of course the case that it is in these areas that massive profits are to be made, illegally and with relatively little effort, on the black market. This is where much more use must be made of Europol.</p>

That is not something I ever thought would happen to me in an assembly with which I would otherwise have thought I was more or less in agreement. Lion hunting was, in fact, what was wanted, as a split vote was requested, and we are in actual fact still short of an explanation from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as to its wishes in connection with a species 90% of which has disappeared over the last decade.</p>
<p class="contents">A second, and probably just as important, question is one to the Commission as to why it has gone easy on the demand for the protection of freshwater turtles. The IUCN regards them as threatened, but millions of them are killed each year. They are used for food and for natural medicine, and this, of course, quite obviously threatens these species’ long-term prospects for survival. If I have been informed correctly, there is nonetheless a proposal by the Commission that nothing special should be done to have them protected, and that is a matter in connection with which we should basically very much like an answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I question why the CITES conference is to be held in Bangkok.</p>
<p class="contents">In Thailand there is still a lot of illegal trading in orang-utans, monkeys and leopards. So if the conference is to be held there, we need to question the Thai Government about this problem. I have seen examples of 50 illegally imported young orang-utans found hidden in cramped cages in private Thai zoos. In my constituency there is an organisation called Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre which wants to get a particular chimpanzee called Naree out of Thailand, but the Thai Government has not been helpful in this regard. If the conference is held in Thailand, it is very important for both this Parliament and the Commission to raise these issues with the Thai Government. We cannot allow this to happen. We have to highlight it. This is an opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome CITES and everything it is trying to do, the fact that the conference is to be held in Thailand will give us an opportunity to raise these issues with the Thai Government, so as to help stop such things happening. Otherwise this trade might seem to be acceptable because the CITES conference is being held there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will comment briefly on some of the questions raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the issue of enforcement and information exchange, last week Member States agreed to step up activities in this area. I should like to tell Mr Sjöstedt that we are totally against secret ballots and I can confirm that we will vote against that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Auken mentioned sea turtles. The Convention accords the strictest protection to sea turtles and we support the proposed protection for fresh–water turtles as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The location was decided at the last conference and it will not be changed now.</p>
<p class="contents">On the great white shark, Madagascar and Australia have informed us that, in the light of widespread legal and scientific objections, they have amended their proposal, removing the demand for the zero quota. We can now give this proposal our unqualified support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we welcome Parliament's initiative in bringing forward this resolution. We are pleased that so many of the views expressed on issues such as bush meat, Napoleon fish, minke whale and ramin, are in accordance with the Community consensus. Ideally, we would have preferred to see a resolution that balances the need for greater protection of some species with the sometimes conflicting considerations of promoting sustainable use and, above all, respecting the scientific integrity of the Convention. This would be in the best interests of CITES and of nature conservation in general. Nevertheless, I am pleased that Parliament has prepared a resolution in such a short time and I thank you for the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
