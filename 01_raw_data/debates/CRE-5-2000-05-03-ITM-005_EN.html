<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, allow me to say first and foremost that I am particularly pleased with Mr Fatuzzo’s explanation of vote, with which I wholeheartedly agree. Anyway, now on to more serious matters.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the resolution of the 1994 Essen European Council on trans-European networks, together with the joint European Parliament and Council decision of 23 July 1996 laying down Community guidelines for trans-European networks, was, at the time, – and I want to stress this – considered to be one of the most important steps towards real European integration. </p>
<p class="contents">Building modern motorways and high-speed rail networks which would traverse more Member States at extremely high speeds and without hindrance, and building modern international airports and ports which would facilitate the free movement of persons, goods and services between various Member States and third countries, was rightly considered to be both a fundamental complement to, and a necessary requirement for, the smooth and successful operation of the internal market, which had just then come into force. Indeed, there can be no internal market without an extensive system of trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, some five years on from the start of this process, it has become clear in practice that meeting this ambitious goal is beset by numerous problems, the first and most important problem being, of course, sufficient funding. As I have stated in my report, what is particularly disconcerting is the fact that seven out of a total of fourteen Essen specific projects have still not secured adequate funding, nor has a definitive timetable been drawn up for their implementation. We all know of course that financing from Community funds clearly falls short of what is actually needed and is never enough to complete the projects. However, this is not its main aim. Direct Community grants for projects only account for a fraction, and a small fraction at that, of Community funding. The main aim of Community funding is to finance feasibility and technical studies, as well as interest subsidies and loan guarantees. In other words, its role is to support and complement measures taken by Members States, which are primarily responsible for financing and constructing trans-European networks, not purely to complete projects. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, the concerns and difficulties of Member States’ governments are understandable, particularly if one considers the public spending cuts to which all the Member States were more or less forced to take recourse during the nineties in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and qualify for EMU. Nonetheless, the problem still remains. And we must admit that, without funding, there can be no trans-European networks. That is perhaps why the main proposal of my report centres on the fact that financial resources earmarked for building trans-European networks must be increased. The Commission and, more importantly, the Member States, must address this problem. </p>
<p class="contents">Our second proposal is to strengthen cooperation between the public and private sector in building trans-European networks, because we feel that, if it provides funds, the public sector will be able to implement more projects, i.e. it will be able to mobilise private sector finance. I would like to stress how important a role the European Investment Bank plays in this regard, too. </p>
<p class="contents">The third proposal is that the proportion of funds earmarked in the Community budget for TEN studies should be reduced from 47% to 30%, so that there is money left over for grants for building the networks and for loans. </p>
<p class="contents">The fourth proposal is that measures and incentives should be taken for the seven problematic networks and, above all, a timetable should be drawn up for their completion. We therefore call upon the Commission to work with the competent Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">The fifth proposal is that the Commission should accord greater importance to the forthcoming revision of the TEN guidelines in order to improve access from Europe’s island and remote regions to the central regions. I trust you will forgive my sensitivity in this matter, given that I come from both an island and a remote region. </p>
<p class="contents">Another proposal in my report is that there should be close cooperation between the Commission, Germany, Austria and Italy on the Brenner base-level tunnel, a Community project of the utmost importance which, of course, comes within the scope of trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that the principle of efficiency should be highlighted by encouraging alternative solutions rather than new investment and by promoting new technologies and intelligent transport systems, such as telematics for road users and new signalling for the rail networks </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like to ask the Commission to include in its future annual reports more information on funding by Member States on the periphery<span class="bold"> </span>and the private sector. Since it is the responsibility of the Member States and the regions to provide such information, we also call upon them, Member States and regions alike, to provide the Commission with the necessary data.</p>

Community policy in the field of trans-European networks is of major importance because it is not possible to have a common transport policy without a convergent infrastructures policy, as is stressed in the Maastricht Treaty. Efficient transport infrastructures are essential for economic growth and employment, as they are for the competitiveness of companies which depend on the movement of persons, goods and resources. </p>
<p class="contents">According to this debate, Europe, first and foremost, is that political Europe towards which we are striving, but it is also the result of economic and social cohesion. It is true that the European Union’s budgetary resources are insufficient and need to be increased, and it is also true that we need to increase the contributions of public bodies as well as public/private partnerships. In this regard, my Group has drawn the Commission’s attention to the fact that the report does not contain information on sources of funding other than the Community budget and the European Investment Bank, and it has also stressed its concern that as many as seven Essen projects have not been given a guarantee that they will be completed within the timeframes envisaged. </p>
<p class="contents">We, too, say ‘Yes’ to the Brenner Pass and we, too, say ‘Yes’ to the use of new technologies. However, the Member States must respect the pledges made, and the Commission must also take into account the guidelines established for the B5-700 budget line – a major budget line established in 1998 – promoting more environmentally friendly models and, above all, taking the different factors into consideration where a trans-European link passes through densely populated areas or highly industrialised regions. </p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we also consider that appropriations set aside for these projects must not exceed 50% and that, after due analysis, the amounts still available for projects on which little progress has been made could be recouped and used for other projects with the same priorities, including environmental priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the original project did not set out a list of priorities, a major shortcoming. I therefore consider it essential for the Commission to accept the points laid down in this report, and which have been explained by the rapporteur, as they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brenner Pass covers a region that includes three countries and, as such, it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention. At present, 1.2 million lorries cross the Brenner Pass every year. The growth in the transport of goods far exceeds earlier rates of increase. The free movement of persons, one of the freedoms in the European Union, cannot be achieved properly either. Good Friday saw extremely lengthy tailbacks on the Brenner Pass.</p>
<p class="contents">We, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Swoboda and I – as pointed out in the explanatory statement of this motion in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – tabled a motion in which we justified this initiative as being a means of achieving an innovative model and approach to project development. It breaks new ground and can set an example to the European Union. Under the Prodi government, the Italian legislature had already considered the possibility of cross-financing road – i.e. road tolls – and rail transport and indeed approved it. I believe that can act as a further model and pave the way to an innovative approach. That is an absolute must, especially in an environmentally sensitive area, and I hope the Commission will exhibit the necessary sensitivity.</p>

The report is as good and judicious as Mr Hatzidakis is in his chairmanship of the committee, for which he certainly deserves recognition and thanks. Let me also take this opportunity to support him when he says that the financial resources for developing the trans-European networks are no longer adequate. He proposes increasing the budget funding. According to Commissioner Schreyer today, that will not be very easy to achieve. That is why Mr Hatzidakis quite rightly proposed in committee that funding should also be procured from private or other semi-public institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, put forward several ideas on the subject on the basis of the activities of a working party and I hope Mrs Schreyer will be able to develop and take up some of these ideas, for without an incentive system of extra funding from the private sector too, we will not succeed in achieving what Mr Hatzidakis, the committee and, I hope, Parliament too, will propose tomorrow. It is quite clear that in view of the additional tasks that we are also confronted with in transport, when we think of Eastern Europe and the candidate countries, it will not be possible to achieve what Mr Ebner has just called for, namely redeployment from road to rail, especially in bottleneck areas. That is not an anti-roads policy, because it will, of course, free up the roads for the kind of transport best suited to them. That is why we need this redeployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Some successes have been achieved, especially in relation to the agreement with Switzerland; in other areas, however, we have been less successful. Let me also say a few words on the Brenner base-level tunnel. The European Commission has already financed the feasibility study, in fact financed it more heavily than other projects. Studies alone, however, are not enough. That is why we do not yet have any additional mode of transport, why no fewer cars are being driven and why we are not seeing a switch to rail transport. That is why we must tackle the projects and why we need investment. We also tabled a motion to this effect on account of our common concern in committee.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The three governments concerned and the Commission really must act now, begin with the spadework and start building, while, of course, at the same time guaranteeing the necessary funding. I believe the Brenner base-level project is one of the most important European projects that need tackling, with a view to making north-south traffic environment-friendly and efficient. If we combine that with the additional measures concerning the candidate countries, then, in five to ten years’ time, we could see an efficient transport system in Europe, and that is something we urgently need! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has gone into the matter with great care and raised some very important issues. Our Group supports him, for example, on the issue of coordinating regional and private funding in the Member States of the Union. However, I would like to underline a few issues. The annual report shows that shortcomings exist in the way money spent on the development of trans-European networks is monitored, and insufficient details are available as to the results achieved through the use of funds. We need more precise accounts of <span class="italic">inter alia </span>how the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, funds from financial sources not included in the Union budget and funds from the Member States are spent to improve trans-European transport networks. We also need a report on the effects of functional transport networks on a sustainable economy and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has quite rightly pointed out that, of the fourteen Essen specific projects, seven still require confirmation of their funding and timetables. In addition, the Essen projects have devoured a larger proportion of the Union’s funding for transport than was agreed. In the future, greater care should be taken in selecting such specific projects. At the same time, it must be ensured that the Member States will commit themselves to them, set aside a sufficiently large share of funding for them, and give them priority in their own plans. The Annual Report shows that more money is also needed for the development of transport and traffic safety through the Union budget, since transport communications are so vital for the economy, employment and, furthermore, for social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future we shall have to pay more attention to the coordination of various forms of transport. At the same time, we shall also have to give consideration to the link between regional policy and transport. Balanced regional development can help to slow down the trend towards centralisation and reduce traffic congestion. In addition to addressing the problems of traffic in congested areas, we will also have to ensure that the trans-European networks are extended and that they are also developed in areas where the volume of traffic is lighter – areas where there is less traffic, remote areas, and areas where the physical environment presents greater problems. Good communications are a vital necessity in these areas.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trans-European transport networks, and the 14 specific projects in particular, have not succeeded in any of the aims they were in fact intended to achieve, even though a great deal of money has already been invested. But two of these aims really are vital to the European Union. One is the key aim of economic and social cohesion, which holds the European Union together. These TENs were designed to prevent the drifting apart, or the risk of a drift apart, between poor and affluent regions. They have not done so. On the contrary, the 14 selected projects have, in fact, driven the regions further apart, and have encouraged a trend towards increased economic activity in the prosperous economic regions, because transport links have been constructed between them, while the poorer regions have become increasingly isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is still a mistake to think that the trans-European networks help reduce mass unemployment. On the contrary, unemployment has risen: even in 1995, in the ten poorest regions, unemployment was seven times higher than in the richest regions, while today it is eight times higher, and rising.</p>
<p class="contents">So I really wonder whether we can afford to continue putting European taxpayers’ money in concrete without this having a significant impact on employment. Is there really any point in investing more money and calling for more money in this case? Is that not an incorrect response in structural terms, because we could do far more sensible things with the money in order to regenerate employment. I also wonder whether the value of these projects has not been offset by the environmental destruction they cause. In fact, they have achieved nothing. They have destroyed much of the living space of the people of Europe and we should take the mass protest movements against motorways seriously, for they often point the way to more sensible and less destructive options.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the people who are protesting are actually right. Europe needs a considerably more intelligent and sustained transport policy, based on a modern approach that thinks ahead to the next generation, realising that resources are finite. As regards the 14 projects, the European Parliament’s call for a cost-benefit analysis was not heeded, whilst its call for environmental compatibility checks for all the projects was also ignored; only partial checks were carried out, which conflicts with the relevant directive. I think we really need to improve goods transport, which must be facilitated by rail in order to be sustainable. We must revise the TENs policy with a view to combining mobility with sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is true to some extent but they also make our society more vulnerable. They help to strengthen the cohesion between the economies of the EU Member States. Each country is becoming increasingly reliant on imported energy and a great deal of effort also goes into consultation and legal rulings. </p>
<p class="contents">What effect does this have on the people in Europe? Perhaps an increase in the number of jobs in the short term. In the longer term, it could be that, quite unintentionally, businesses become more vulnerable owing to technical defects in a costly transport system and that jobs could, at short notice, be moved to areas with lower wages, poorer working conditions and fewer environmental requirements. Nothing therefore to get too excited about for the time being. </p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the major transport projects are not as promising as the annual report would like to suggest. For the north-south high-speed link from Berlin to Verona, only a few minor components have been constructed. In England, the connection of the high-speed link which runs through the Channel Tunnel has been in the doldrums for many years as a result of the privatisation and the splitting up of the railway companies in that country. Spain has decided <span class="italic">not</span> to go ahead with a European standard gauge for the high-speed link between Madrid and Barcelona, which <span class="italic">was</span> used for the line from Madrid to Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction of the Betuwe line through the Netherlands is becoming increasingly controversial. Economic experts have calculated that this expensive line would never be a success. The costs seem to increase daily, the inland shipping industry considers this line to be distorting competition, freight transport by road does not seem to have gone down as a result and environmental activists are thwarting activities on a daily basis. All in all, a good enough reason to abandon the Betuwe line project. </p>
<p class="contents">There is still far too little broad-based, social debate on the priorities set and choices made. The people of Europe are entitled to more information on the impact of the TENs, i.e. the impact on their livelihoods, the costs involved, environmental considerations and the rate of implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s 1998 annual report on trans-European transport networks gives a clear overall picture of the progress that has been made in certain specific projects as well as containing valuable information on the contributions made to these infrastructural projects by the various sources of Community funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs. At present, the funding is decidedly inadequate if we are to attempt seriously to meet the commitments entered into at the Essen European Summit in 1994. I share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen Essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation. It would be useful if the Commission, in its future annual reports, specified what funding has been provided by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, in addition to European funding, with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will shortly undertake a revision of the TEN guidelines. I hope that in these new guidelines they will accord greater importance to improving access to trans-European network funding for Europe’s island and remote regions. It is important to place particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable transport links with these disadvantaged regions if they are to share equally in the benefits of a unified single market.</p>
<p class="contents">If the revision of the TEN guidelines were to concentrate just on existing bottlenecks as announced by the Commission in its work programme for the year 2000, this would focus the funding on the more economically developed central regions of the Union, perhaps to the detriment of the outermost regions. A package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network. The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is worth remembering that the decisions that led to the choice of these 14 major projects date back to the Essen Summit, which took place in 1994, that is, already six years ago now. Six years on from that decision, only half of these projects have made any real progress, and those projects are, by and large, concentrated in the northern half of the continent. A positive start has been made, but the situation looks pretty grim as regards the other projects and, in particular, for the remote regions, as Mr Collins has already pointed out. I am particularly thinking of the Southern link, which is supposed to link France, in particular Lyon, together with Turin and Trieste, to the rest of the Balkans that we would like to see firmly annexed to Europe. I am also thinking of the other part of Europe, comprising of Austria, with its specific problems mentioned by other speakers, Hungary, and the other countries of central Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would remind you that it is not only about opening up a Piedmont which is hidden away, a Piedmont stuck in the Alps. This is about connecting a whole region of the continent, the Balkans and central Europe, to the southern part of Europe, to France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and no real progress has been made as regards this project.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in response to what Mrs Schroedter said, I feel that we must not lose sight of the fact that what these major projects are mainly concerned with is the development of railway infrastructures. This particularly applies to this southern axis, which would make Paris only three and a half hours distant from Milan. There are, however, difficult choices to be made in order to avoid the huge pollution-related problems currently in the news in Austria, as well as in Italy and Germany. Choices have to be made; there must be investment and this decision, this choice that was made in Essen, is still no closer to being taken, six years down the line.</p>
<p class="contents">This concerns Member States, of course, and certainly Italy in particular, which has not supported this project with sufficient vigour, but it also concerns the Commission, as the rapporteur made very clear. It is the Commission’s duty to come up with measures which encourage both public authorities and private companies to invest in these huge trans-European networks. I therefore consider it to be crucial that the Commission submits new proposals so that these dossiers, which are still deadlocked, can proceed as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why we support the Hatzidakis report and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on its clarity, despite the technical nature of the subject.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the general rules governing the granting of Community financial aid to the trans-European networks are strictly complied with. Indeed, trans-European transport policy has considerable repercussions as regards the sustainable development of local economies and job creation. Furthermore, we are hoping that there will be transparency in the invitations to tender when public and private partnerships are launched so that everyone can genuinely participate in developing these networks. We endorse paragraph 9 in the report, which states that the Commission should faithfully adhere to the budgetary guidelines established for TEN projects. This report is the logical continuation of the critical analysis set out in the annual report, the aim being to monitor Community financing for projects of common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">On this matter, we have to ask ourselves why the cost of feasibility studies and technical assistance measures accounts for 47% of the budget, that is, almost EUR 223 million. What is more, Community financing of the TEN-T represents a tiny percentage of the total costs, with the lion’s share of the financing falling to Member States. Why are only estimates available? Indeed, financing for seven of the fourteen projects, i.e. half, is still not guaranteed and no timetable has yet been agreed. The Commission must, as quickly as possible, put forward fundamental measures and incentives to promote these specific projects and, in coordination with the Member States concerned, draw up a timetable for their implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the rapporteur, I am disturbed about this. One of these projects is the extension of the north-south link, and in particular the Brenner base-level tunnel. Through this project the European Union could demonstrate that it is not just paying lip service to the idea of shifting transit transport from road to rail. This is an opportunity to reduce the environmental burden on the region concerned and its population. Moreover, this project will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, there is still a very long way to go as regards its implementation. The subsidiary of the Austrian Brenner Railway Company and the Italian Railways, which is supposed to complete the project planning within a period of eighteen months, was only set up at the end of last year. This means that, more than five years after Essen, there are still no concrete plans on the table. The people of the region cannot understand that. For it is they who have to live with the ever-growing avalanche of traffic. The existing rules, under which a maximum of 10% of the total investment can be funded by the Union, are quite simply inadequate and unfair for projects that have enormous implications for the future of the European economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States that will benefit from the completion of the Brenner base-level tunnel cannot shrug off their responsibility and leave it entirely to the countries directly concerned, like Germany, Austria and Italy, to shoulder the financial burden. In the end, that kind of attitude has nothing to do with solidarity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact she has insulted us as well, for Parliament and the Council adopted the 1996 guideline by codecision on a proposal from the Council. If that was such a terrible thing, the Greens should have opposed it at the time. They did not do so. Let me just mention two projects that have been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, from the environmental standpoint, the rail link across the Øresund was precisely the right thing to do. We want railways and we want links with remote regions. The new Anglo-Irish rail links are of great benefit to the environment and the region. The Greens are quite simply wrong to criticise the TENs as benefiting only the central and most densely populated states.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I agree with Mr Ebner and others that, as far as the Brenner base-level tunnel is concerned, we have to think up some new ideas. Our committee proposes a four-sided agreement between the three states concerned and the Union. The Brenner base-level tunnel is an unusually large-scale project, and also a project with an unusually significant impact on the environment, for the Alps cannot be compared with the lowlands of the Netherlands or Friesland in Germany. The environmental situation in the Alps is particularly problematic. Quite simply, the way the noise and the stench of cars remains trapped in the valleys is quite different from conditions on flat ground. Something therefore needs to be done in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we must persuade governments not to shift the blame onto each other. The Italians say they will start building when the Austrians build. The Germans say they will begin building once the Austrians are building. The Austrians say they will start to build once the Germans and the Italians begin. So we need clear yardsticks and data on who pays what and when, and the Community must make a serious effort to get this whole project going.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make two final comments. Madam Vice-President of the Commission. Take your time with the revision of the trans-European networks! First, you should take another look at all the projects in the light of today’s debate. We do not want more show projects, 14 or 15 show projects, with no guaranteed financing. In this revision, we should identify measures as priorities only if we are certain they can be financed over a period of 10-15 years. For the citizens will lose confidence in us if we declare certain projects to be priorities and then do not execute them. We must remind the Member States that they have committed themselves to guaranteeing the financing, committed themselves to executing the plan. Then we really must take them at their word and say: we will only list specific projects if they really are ready to be executed and financed. Take your time and reopen these difficult discussions with the Member States so that you, as the Commission, do not propose projects in which we make fools of ourselves in front of the citizens, but projects that are feasible!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, of course, I disagree with what Mrs Schroedter has just said. </p>
<p class="contents">We should indeed accord trans-European networks the real importance which they deserve. We should ensure that the financial resources spent on TENs are increased. What is more, allow me to say that we owe this increase since, in the last decade, the need to cut spending in view of the obligation to meet the criteria and objectives of Economic and Monetary Union also badly affected TEN funding. We should speed up the implementation of these projects by improving procedures and facilitating their funding through flexible public and private sector partnerships. We should see to it that we overcome any hurdles that are holding up 7 of the 14 Essen projects and leaving us exposed. And, of course, we should attach importance during the revision of the TEN guidelines to access to island regions and to regions which have difficulty obtaining access to the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has presented us in its 1998 annual report with a rough picture of the state of progress in the construction of these networks, a picture which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – which, in the report under discussion, is asking for greater efficiency in the whole network construction operation – would like to be more detailed and informative. The main role in the whole of this extremely important operation for the future of Europe belongs to the Commission and we call on it, in collaboration with the Member States, to give absolute priority, in the full meaning and with all the implications of the word, to developing these main arteries in the body of Europe so that it can function in the way we all want it to and meet the expectations of European citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would like to thank and congratulate the chairman of the committee and rapporteur, my fellow countryman Konstantinos Hatzidakis, for the work which he has put into his report which, of course, should be adopted.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a vicious circle, which can only be broken by a political and economic joint action which addresses all the issues that are causing this underdevelopment.</p>
<p class="contents">The trans-European networks policy is not, however, being implemented in such a way as to resolve this crucial issue, despite the fact that it was introduced with the specific aim of establishing direct links between remote countries and the Union’s central regions. The basic aim of the specific projects and budgets of the trans-European networks, as well as those financed by the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which resulted from a policy that was greatly desired by the Member States, yet poorly accepted and supported by the Commission, was to establish direct links between those regions that have a higher per capita income. In doing so, they rode roughshod over the regulations currently in force, with the damaging consequences with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the report by Mr Hatzidakis, whom I congratulate, provides us with a good opportunity to get to grips with the political dimension of the current situation and to try to find a solution to it, in line with the decisive reform of the trans-European networks policy which is due to be implemented in the 2000-2006 period.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore the intention of our political group, as the amendments that have been presented have highlighted, to ensure that the networks are compatible with sustainable development and that the reform corresponds to the objective of uniting the whole Community by prioritising the remote regions, which have hitherto been neglected. Finally, it is our intention to upgrade the railways and to bring about the decentralisation of the networks, particularly with regard to airports and ports. The concentration of road, airport and port networks is causing serious congestion and environmental problems which we must prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will be able to bring about the changes that the European Union needs in order to achieve the regional balance and social cohesion that we are advocating.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware that, at this precise moment, Regional Development Plans are being approved for the period 2000-2006 which will contribute to isolating even further the Objective 1 regions, which desperately need a modern connection to the whole of Europe, including high speed rail links. Amongst these regions are my own country, Galicia, and the entire north-western Iberian Peninsula, covering both Spain and Portugal, an Atlantic region which is crucial to the whole of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But apart from the simple budgetary and financial considerations, in more general terms, it is the Commission’s general guidelines in this area that are worthy of criticism. We do agree, of course, with the principle that it is necessary to create trans-European networks for the people of Europe, for the movement of people and goods, for economic and social cohesion and for rail alternatives to the all-powerful motorway. We cannot, however, accept the method that has been imposed or the solutions that have been proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Are all the fourteen projects that have been accepted relevant or essential to the needs of local populations? Have they been devised in association or in consultation, or is the rationale of the trans-European networks, as the report implies, only based on the free market? It is, moreover, not by chance that out of the fourteen projects, the seven whose timetable and financing are still in doubt are precisely those which do not only answer to the demands of profit.</p>
<p class="contents">The most negative aspect, however, seems to be the financing. It is based on the principle that public funds cannot be increased, which is a moot point. It therefore proposes to have recourse to private funds, in the form of partnerships, and this, moreover, is an essential element of the project. This approach to rail transport raises the issue of public service. Clearly, if private operators are involved in the financing, they will aim for maximum profit. We must make use of private companies because they profit from the infrastructures, but in the form of tax deductions and not by them having an interest in the capital of railway companies. The idea of a European public rail service must be developed and we reject privatisation and access to the capital of rail companies, including for new projects. Once again, Europe is responding to a genuine need on the part of the people, the need for a high-quality European rail transport network, which is outstanding for both passengers and staff, with a race for profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission’s annual report on trans-European networks once again sets out the progress made with many transport projects and emphasises the important part the TENs play in protecting the environment. I take the view that the 14 projects decided at Essen play a very significant role in the extension of the European transport networks and, like many speakers before me, I want to stress the enormous importance of the Brenner base-level tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Alpine transit must be looked at and understood as an overall problem. Certainly Austria, France and the neighbouring states are affected most. To show you or make you more aware of the seriousness of the situation, let me tell you that about 30% of transit traffic round Switzerland goes via the Brenner, which means that Austria bears the main burden. It should also be noted that in Austria, 80% of goods are carried by road and only 20% by rail, while in Switzerland the proportion is exactly the reverse. When some people ask why Austria is getting so agitated, since surely there is a similar volume of traffic elsewhere too, for instance in the Ruhr region, I have to reply yes, that is true, but the topographical features of Tyrol, of the Inntal, simply differ from those in other areas, such as the plains. Moreover, the Inntal in Austria is one of the most densely populated regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Alpine transit is an integral problem which needs to be addressed in integral terms. We cannot look separately at Brenner, toll roads and Alpine transit. As for carrying out the construction timetables, I can say that we already have definite construction schedules in the Lower Inntal. Now we also need a clear political resolve, and not just on the part of the Member States. What we need is cross-financing. I would consider the transport costs directive an appropriate legal basis. I think that would give us sound financing.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for public-private partnerships, for I think working together is the best way to succeed. We have a massive problem with north-south transit. I am against further studies of the Brenner Pass, for we already have enough of them as it is. What we need is to complete the Brenner base-level tunnel rapidly, for the sake of the population concerned, the environment and a sustainable, forward-looking transport policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trans-European networks are essential for the completion of the internal market, but also for the economic and social cohesion of the European Union. The Commission’s report on the implementation of the trans-European networks in 1998 outlines, in general terms, the results of the financial implementation of the priorities that were established, such as rail transport to exceed the 50% minimum that had been laid down. This is a good sign. It is nevertheless important to analyse these figures country by country and not just in aggregate, because the same approach should be adopted in every region.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of investments by sector may seem appropriate but the same cannot be said about other aspects that are worth pointing out and on which I would like to hear Commissioner de Palacio’s opinion.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the need for investment in the trans-European networks that compensates for the decrease seen during the 1990s, not just by increasing appropriations, but also through the participation of the private sector and through the use of Eurobonds.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the adoption of fundamental measures which will stimulate progress in the seven specific projects still experiencing difficulties, so that their completion can be scheduled and the necessary work accomplished.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, that in future reviews of the trans-European networks, greater importance is attached to the access of the remote regions to the central regions and to island regions.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to stress the fact that economic and social cohesion is not compatible with the Commission’s working proposals on this matter for 2000, because by seeking to concentrate investment in existing bottlenecks, we would be favouring the central regions, to the detriment of remote regions, such as Portugal, which are obviously the regions with the greatest need for transport networks that bring them closer to more highly-developed areas.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Brenner is a particularly good example of the problems besetting trans-European transport today. Transport by rail, at least to the south of the Brenner, is not operating and the international link is not operating either. That is why we have such major problems today and if we also need a base-level tunnel because of these mistakes and problems I would suggest that we approach the matter with great sensitivity, and that we proceed with care, for this is a project for centuries to come. If we do decide to undertake it, we need to choose the environmentally cleanest, economically soundest option, as well as the most functional option. That is why I have tabled a minor amendment to paragraph 7. Perhaps we do not need another study, but we should weigh things up properly and select the best project.</p>
<p class="contents">I have put one of these projects before the Transport Committee. There are few better or equally good ones. We must choose the best because our transport policy, and therefore the EU, will also be measured by this small project.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rail transport, the main lines as well as the district ones, should be a public service, which aims to meet the needs of the population, not to generate private profit. The participation of private capital will necessarily result in a quest for profit, to the detriment both of users and of those who work in the sector. Far too many recent disasters, particularly the one at Paddington station in Great Britain, illustrate the incompatibility between the quest for profit and safety. As stipulated in the explanatory statement of the report, public investment is continually decreasing and in less than twenty years, has fallen from 1.5% of the European Union’s GNP to 0.9%. This has resulted in falling standards in rail transport as a whole as well as staff reductions, which has contributed to keeping unemployment levels high.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States of the European Union do not adopt a new policy, or, in other words, if they do not prioritise investment in public services rather than endless subsidies to the bosses, any decision on a genuine public transport service operating on a European scale under the best safety conditions will remain nothing but empty rhetoric. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must, however, be pointed out that the European Union’s budgetary resources fall considerably short of the requirements and the challenge generated by the establishment of a trans-European transport network.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless there is an increase in the financial contribution made by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, we will not see any significant progress in this area in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should nevertheless like to stress the fact that recourse to private finance should never be an obstacle to the development of communications in regions which currently have a per capita income well below the Community average. With regard to the future review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks, I feel I must once again draw the Commission’s attention to the need to attach greater importance to improving access to Europe’s remote and isolated regions, and to focus particularly on establishing sustainable transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of such investments on the economy of these regions and on employment is a crucial factor in the socio-economic development of these regions. The Commission’s work programme for the year 2000 lays down that the review of the guidelines for trans-European transport networks must concentrate on reducing bottlenecks in order to rationalise traffic in Europe and to make it flow more freely. As I understand it, this amounts to saying that the review currently being prepared will mainly concern the central regions of the European Union, which are the main victims of these congestion problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only hope that this hypothesis does not mean that the remote and, to an even greater extent, the extremely remote regions might only be incidentally affected by this review. This fear, which has been mentioned several times by many of my colleagues, led me to table an amendment to this effect, which was adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and which features in Mr Hatzidakis’s excellent report.</p>

We should therefore have already set in motion the TEN projects that have still to get off the ground. It is no secret that I am very much in favour of a permanent link between Denmark and Germany, and I am glad that the new Danish Minister for Transport is also a supporter of the project. However, I am a little put out that German politicians are rather less enthusiastic. There has previously been some doubt as to whether a permanent link across the Fehmarn Belt is the way forward, but any such doubt has now been shown to be groundless. All the inquiry reports from the Danish and German Ministries of Transport show that there are neither environmental nor financial problems with building a bridge. With a faster and easier link between Denmark and Germany, we can build bridges to the new democracies in the East. We are not only building a bridge in physical terms, for practical purposes. We are building a bridge between countries to help industry and for human, political, social and cultural reasons. Building a permanent link between Germany and Denmark will create many new and much-needed jobs in the area. There are almost always people who automatically say ‘no’ to anything new. Anything which brings about change is a little frightening, whether it be EMU, the euro, environmentalism or a bridge. One should not, however, be afraid of something good. A link across the Fehmarn Belt is an exciting, rather than a frightening project. Finally, I should like to add my voice to the call to increase the budget appropriations for the trans-European transport networks, as they are quite inadequate. Improved growth and employment require sums of a quite different order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is precisely why this decision was so extraordinarily important. A properly functioning internal market will never, of course, be possible without extensive investment in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Today’s report nonetheless raises a number of questions about how we are actually to follow up our various decisions. A few of these TEN projects have been carried out within a reasonable timeframe. Personally, I am very glad that one of these projects in particular has been carried out, namely the permanent link across the Sound between Sweden and Denmark which is to be opened on time in just a few months. I am more doubtful, however, where a number of the other projects are concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">As quite a number of people here have said, many of these projects are being developed awfully slowly. The rapporteur who, by the way, has done a quite excellent job, has expressed his concern about this. It is, indeed, very worrying when these ventures are not taken seriously. Let me give an example of this. It concerns the Nordic triangle, designed to link the Scandinavian capitals by high-speed train and motorway. This is something which the countries concerned have undertaken to carry out, but it is a terribly slow process. Money is forever being transferred to other projects which are obviously considered more important than this major European project. This happens because there is every opportunity to transfer money in this way, there being no proper deadlines for when the projects concerned are to be carried out. Neither the road nor the railway ventures are, therefore, going to be finished within a reasonable period of time. </p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like, here today, to ask the Commission’s representative a number of questions. When does the Commission think that the Nordic triangle and the other TEN projects will be complete? What is the Commission actually doing to make sure that they are in fact completed? Is the Commission prepared to commit itself to establishing specific deadlines for completing the outstanding projects and, subsequently, also to ensure that these deadlines are met? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I would firstly like to express my sincere gratitude for the work accomplished by Mr Hatzidakis, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the review of the trans-European networks which, in the coming months, I will have to present to this House. I believe that his work will contribute decisively to the documents which the Commission will produce. I would also like to express my thanks for the contribution made by Mrs Sbarbati, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, as well as for the interventions of the other speakers who have participated in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as well as analysing the situation, the most important thing is to look to the future. Accordingly, I will take this opportunity to make some observations on behalf of the Commission. Firstly, I fully agree with Mr Hatzidakis on the importance given to Community policy on trans-European networks and I also share Parliament’s concern, expressed not only by Mr Hatzidakis, but also by the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and by other MEPs, on the need for this policy to be provided with adequate financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to thank Parliament for its support for the provision of a total of EUR 4.6 billion for the period 2000-2006 for this chapter. Nevertheless, I should remind Members that, every year, the Commission gives consideration to projects which amount to three times the amount allocated annually in this budget. At the same time, there is an agreement by all parties not to increase the overall budgets and, in this respect, you have also heard my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, talk of our current budgetary difficulties resulting from new needs and matters of urgency, such as meeting the Union’s main political commitments following the war in Kosovo. In this respect, I share the European Parliament’s concern with regard to the adequate funding of transport networks, but I believe that we can jointly assume some of these responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that we know that Community support for projects carried out during 1996, 1997 and 1998 has accounted for 30% of the total, which is a very significant figure. It is true that these include projects in Objective 1 areas and cohesion countries, which has allowed the percentage of cofinancing to be greater. However, I must tell you that we cannot provide you with overall information, because we are not only talking about Community finance but also about finance provided by individual countries and private sectors in some cases, as well as regions and local authorities. Therefore, we can only provide the information which is available to us and make analyses based on that data.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore reiterate something that Mr Jarzembowski said, which is that some of those responsible are from outside the Commission and, of course, the will of the different Member States of the Union to promote and implement these projects is of crucial importance.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that some projects are being delayed. In this regard, I would like to say that the target date is 2010. There is therefore still time to implement them within the time limit. Furthermore, some of the projects present great technical difficulties. I will concentrate for a moment on one of the most talked-about projects: the Brenner base-level tunnel. That tunnel is a symbolic project as far as the European Union’s technological capacities and its ability to act are concerned. We are talking about 54 kilometres of tunnel in one of our most mountainous areas, with a series of unknown factors and uncertainties which require that the project be guaranteed as far as possible before we make such a huge investment as the one required for the Brenner tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to carry out the Channel Tunnel project, it was necessary to carry out major studies before establishing the routes and detailing and beginning the project. This is also true in the case of the Brenner. It is perhaps better to begin something late, but to begin with all the guarantees in place, than to find half way through that the studies have not warned us of some difficulty or other, meaning that we have to go into reverse, which would cause even greater delays.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, new studies are under way, through an agreement between a group of interested parties, to determine the definitive route of the Brenner tunnel. It has not been abandoned, it is just that it is an enormously complex project, ladies and gentlemen, and we must understand that these studies will probably take a further five years to complete. I want to make this very clear. We are talking about very far-off dates, but this does not mean that there is no will. On the contrary, there is an absolute will. This must, however, be based on the certainty that the project can be carried out in a way which will not damage our credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to point out that the level of funding in terms of the total appropriations for the 14 principal TEN projects has been 60%. That was the percentage which you, the Parliament, considered appropriate in your most recent resolutions. It is midway between your initial proposal and the Council’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to some of the questions raised, I would like to tell you that, with regard to the changes to the financial rules for the trans-European networks approved last year, new financing possibilities were created by means of partnerships between the public and private sectors. These partnerships will be promoted in various ways. Firstly, thanks to the introduction of a multiannual indicative programme which will allow for private sector support with greater security and where the developers will enjoy guaranteed Community funding for several years. That programme will cover the period 2001-2006. Secondly, the budget line for trans-European networks will contribute risk capital financing, which could promote – and I hope this is the case – the creation of investment funds geared to the TENs and, to this end, we have already asked for expressions of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">We are about to review the guidelines on the trans-European transport networks. I will be presenting this review report and an initial proposal shortly. However, it must be said that the objectives of the trans-European networks are the development of the single market and social and economic cohesion. I would like to make this very clear. Therefore, the remote regions, the extremely remote regions and the least developed regions must be at the heart of Community action. However, resolving bottlenecks does not harm the remote regions. I would like to give one very clear example: the bottleneck on the railway in Bordeaux. Does this affect France? Yes, of course it affects south-west France, but only to a degree. Its real impact is on the whole of the centre and west of the Iberian Peninsula, that is, most of Spain and Portugal. So when we clear a bottleneck in Bordeaux, we are in fact benefiting the development of an area of the Iberian Peninsula. What I mean to say is that acting in a central area does not always harm the interests of the remote areas, but, on the contrary, in many cases it is perfectly interrelated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, lastly, I would like to refer to the question of the intelligent management of traffic. This aspect will also be included as a key element in the review of the trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis once again and express my gratitude for his work as well as that of the other speakers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
