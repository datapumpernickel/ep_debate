<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgets</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, Mr Lewis’ presentation today of the 2006 budget has confirmed the impression that Parliament’s delegation took away from the Conciliation Committee meeting held on 15 July. Contrary to its name, this meeting resembled a cataloguing of differences rather than a conciliation process. It is indeed true that no one expects consensus to have been reached at this point in the year, but it cannot be denied that the standpoints of the EU’s two budgetary authorities on the 2006 budget are poles apart. Even the consensus that has been reached on important but secondary issues, such as modulation, or in other words the transfer of funds to the tune of EUR 655 million from Heading 1 to rural development, cannot hide this fact. Our goal is to reach agreement on the budget, but this task will be far from easy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is a political body, the members of which, having entered into a contract with their voters one year ago, are mindful of their commitments. Much was said at the time, and is still said, about the need to complete EU enlargement and to invest in cohesion to this end, as well as about the need to breathe fresh life into the Lisbon Strategy and to fund the EU’s new ambitions on the international stage. At the same time, however, there is no getting away from the fact that we also committed ourselves to strict budgetary discipline one year ago. The voting public is firm in its condemnation of undisciplined and hence wasteful spending, yet political ambitions and goals that lack financial backing are nothing but hollow words.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must consider the 2006 budget in terms of the experience it gained last year. With our backs to the wall, so to speak, we agreed to a level of payments that falls short of our needs in 2005, as has already become clear from the level of expenditure so far this year. Furthermore, the 2006 budget must be regarded as a stepping stone to a new Financial Perspective. It was with these two factors in mind that we decided that the Commission’s initial proposals of 1.02% of GNI, which is nearly EUR 7 billion below the ceiling set in the Financial Perspective for 2006, were unsatisfactory. A huge gap exists between these 2006 budget proposals and the Commission’s proposals for payments in 2007, which will be the first year of the new Financial Perspective. This means that it is even more difficult to understand or tolerate the cuts made by the Council, taking payments to just over 1% of GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">This year we have seen the Council taking a more selective and less mechanical approach to budgetary cuts, and I should like to dwell very briefly on the individual headings in turn. The modulation that has been agreed from Heading 1 can be counted as a joint success. At the same time, however, we expect the Commission to put forward proposals regarding agricultural spending in the long term, as a basis for further discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has not been slow to notice that cohesion emerged relatively unscathed from the Council’s cuts, but the preliminary reports that have reached us on the Structural Funds suggest that use of the Funds in 2005 will not correspond to the level specified in the Council’s draft, but will be equal to, if not higher than, the Commission’s initial proposal. The pressure is starting to be felt most in Heading 3, that is to say in the field of internal policies, where the largest cuts in relative terms have been made, amounting to over EUR 500 million. This makes a nonsense of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, which include investment in research and in small and medium-sized enterprises, and will also make it impossible for Parliament to implement its priorities. As far as Heading IV is concerned, however, it is not so much Parliament’s priorities that are in conflict, but the British Presidency’s own statements.</p>
<p class="contents">The arbitrary cuts of around 4% that have been made to all areas, with the exception of the much-favoured common foreign and security policy, will make it impossible for us to meet the never-ending stream of fresh challenges. The latter will not merely relate to the tsunami-hit countries or to Iraq and Afghanistan, since the need will arise to fund assistance for other regions affected by natural disasters. Compensation for sugar producers presents us with a further problem, and the Commission has also raised the issue of administrative expenses, with the possibility of a freeze on the recruitment of employees from the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, our debate on the 2006 budget is taking place against a general backdrop of pessimism. Yet the European Union is in urgent need of good news, and agreement on both the 2006 budget and sensible figures for the Financial Perspective would be exactly the news it has been hoping for. Such agreement could serve to renew people’s faith in the European Union, and it is our common responsibility and task to ensure that it is achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As pointed out by President Lewandowski, we expressed our disappointment very sincerely and firmly back in July, at the Conciliation Committee. We therefore also confirm today that – while we appreciate the speech by Mr Lewis, with its openness and the delicacy of its expression – all this needs to be translated into definite choices.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, unfortunately, a blatant contradiction between the passionate words spoken by Prime Minister Blair in this assembly and the choices the Council has made regarding the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The cuts in the budget – or, if you prefer, your budget forecasts – in relation to the agricultural sector and the Structural Funds, although more limited than last year, confirm the tendency towards an unjustified severity. If adopted, they would open the door to adjustments during the year, accentuating the divide between expectations, which are, moreover, reinforced by a good funds implementation capacity, and the inadequacy of the resources themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to internal and external policies, our worries become fears: we are not convinced, Mr Lewis, by the symmetry between the funds allocated for commitments, which have been reduced by a lesser degree than the payment appropriations, nor can an analysis of the most significant cuts provide an explanation in terms of the political message that we all want to give. This is how the figures add up: 21 million less for businesses; 33 million less for transport; 279 million less for research; 131 million less for information; 20 million less for education and culture and 8 million less for freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an inconsistency between declarations in favour of growth, employment and measures designed to help young people, on the one hand, and on the other hand the reduction of funds in the budget headings, which are vital for achieving these objectives. I would like to ask you, Mr Lewis, what all of this means.</p>
<p class="contents">Does it mean that these policies are vital, but must be implemented by the national governments alone? This is the impression that I have; if it is right, then we are in direct conflict, since these policies must be implemented by the European Union too, in so far as they possess added European value. In my view, this is the fundamental political problem that we need to clarify first of all in order to take consistent action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to heading 4 – the notorious heading of ‘External actions’ – we are demanding that the flexibility instrument be used: with the estimates for heading 4 made beneath the maximum ceiling, as you are asking for, it is not possible to follow up on the traditional priorities of the European Union, the Millennium Goals, emergencies that have arisen over the course of the years – from Iraq to Afghanistan, the tsunami, horizontal programmes and geographical programmes, and now we want, rightly, to add sugar to the list. How is it possible to do all this? And what about the dozens of other measures that have been planned, and I say again, rightly so, as external actions? How can we implement such measures with a reduced financial allocation, without even applying the flexibility instrument?</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression, and I shall use a proverb to express myself, that you want to have your cake and eat it. We are worried and disappointed, but we continue to ask for more reflection on your part and we await, Commissioner, more determined pressure from the European Commission. Within this Parliament, in our midst, the idea is growing of a shake-up, of action taken not on impulse but in a considered manner, to open up people’s eyes and recall everyone to their duties.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received no comforting signals on the financial perspective; in fact, I should say that we have received no signals at all. This, obviously, increases our concerns and the wave of scepticism among citizens; you rightly referred to citizens as – let us say – the main target of our actions, but among citizens there is enormous scepticism, because the European Union has not put itself in a position to implement its policies. Has the UK Presidency perhaps decided to give up on financial perspectives without even giving them a try?</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing the determination with which Prime Minister Blair faces his battles, we would have expected different signals and we continue to await them. But time and deadlines wait for no man: as Mr Blair well knows, faced with the European crisis, to merely scrape by would amount to giving up entirely. We in Parliament, and we hope that Prime Minister Blair and the UK Presidency feel the same, cannot stand passively by while Europe declines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the European Parliament and the Council have different approaches on certain issues regarding the drafting of the budget, but there are also various common threads.</p>
<p class="contents">Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayers’ money. The Council is proposing to reduce the administrative expenditure of the EU institutions by 120 million euro as compared with the institutions’ original requests. It must be said, however, that in many cases this reduction has been implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutions’ work. For this reason, the European Parliament will be proposing a review of the reduction in the institutions’ expenditure, assessing each institution’s budget request and new tasks in 2006 on its individual merits. It is important to ensure the requisite financing for one of the priorities of the EU budget for 2006, which is preparation for the next round of European Union enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join. I believe that the European Union institutions need to adopt a harmonised approach to the hiring of staff from the new Member States. With regard to the European Parliament budget, we should note that tomorrow the European Parliament’s Presidium will adopt a decision on the European Parliament draft budget for 2006, which it will forward for consideration by the Committee on Budgets. As the budget rapporteur, I believe that the Committee on Budgets will need additional information on various matters in order to be able to take each decision on its own merits, particularly in relation to the European Parliament’s information and communication policy. Once again I would like to stress the principle that the level of joint expenditure in the European Parliament budget ought to be set in accordance with needs that have been established following careful evaluation. Achieving a ceiling of 20% of joint administrative expenditure is not an end in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to add a few words about the European Union general budget for 2006. The Council’s proposal to reduce payment appropriations for EU structural funds for 2006 by 150 million euro is incomprehensible. Such an approach is indicative of the Council’s unwillingness to fully finance those commitments which the EU has undertaken within the framework of the existing financial perspective. Bearing in mind the fact that 2006 is the last year of the current financial perspective, it is important to ensure a successful conclusion to existing programmes and to set a volume of commitment and payment appropriations for the 2006 budget that corresponds with the commitments which the European Union has undertaken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dalia Grybauskaitė,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(LT) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the opportunity offered to me today to express my opinion concerning the first proposal by the Council, especially since as early as last June following the first reading we had a chance to exchange our views with Parliament and the Council, as well as with the representatives of political groups of the European Parliament. I would like to share the idea held by most speakers that the 2006 budget is a special one, as it is the last of the current Financial Perspective drawn up by the Commission seeking to most comprehensively and realistically take into consideration the most pressing needs of the European Union, to complete all the important projects and to prepare well for the new financial period. Therefore, in response to the proposal of the Council, I would like to immediately define three areas that in the Commission’s opinion are the most challenging. </p>
<p class="contents"> Having first outlined the importance of the European budget for 2006, I should like to focus on three main areas in which the Commission thinks that the major concerns need to be addressed and resolved by all three institutions, including the budgetary authorities in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main concerns relate to Heading 3, where we think that the reductions proposed by the Council are not justified and cannot be supported by the Commission, mainly because the requirements and the amounts proposed by the Commission were based on projects already committed and ongoing. We think that such reductions will create many problems for the payment of bills for ongoing projects in the Community in 2006 for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, half of the proposed reductions in payment appropriations are concentrated on activities which represent only about 10% of the total budget. Surprisingly, no justification is given for concentrating the reductions in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">In Heading 4 the reductions proposed by the Council will create at least three serious problems. First of all, the reduction goes against the decisions taken by the General Affairs Council itself, especially regarding post-tsunami reconstruction in Asia and the renewed commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. Second, in relation to recent developments in the world, we expect, and have already had indications, that Europe will be asked to assist in the disengagement process from Gaza. The third problem concerns the negotiations on the fisheries agreement with Morocco. All these three elements make it more difficult to accept or look favourably upon the Council's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Heading 5 was raised and discussed at length at the 15 July meeting between the three institutions. As promised, on Friday I sent to both budgetary authorities additional information on the progress of recruitment from EU-10 and EU-15. By 31 July this year, 90% of the recruitment targets from new Member States had been fulfilled. We believe that the proposed reductions forwarded by the Council are the result of a misunderstanding between us and may well derive from a technical error.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much expect that, before second reading, we will be able to engage in consultations with the Council in particular in an effort to resolve this issue. The proposal on the table today means that for 2006 not only will we be unable to recruit from EU-10, but we will be stopping all recruitment in the Commission, as well as lacking the resources to pay salaries for existing staff levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking all this into account and in reply to Mrs Pittella's request that the Commission take as forceful an approach as possible to this proposal, let me say that we are committed to resolving all possible questions in cooperation with the budgetary authorities. I call on all sides to show goodwill in this endeavour, as it will be greatly needed if we are to finalise the deal for this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the criticism then expressed by the European Parliament concerning insufficient appropriations for commitments and payments, on 15 July 2005 the ECOFIN Council decided to propose a reduction of allocations for payments by EUR 1.1 billion and commitment appropriations by EUR 478 million as compared to the Preliminary Draft Budget. This proposal, in my opinion, clearly demonstrates that the Council virtually disregards the actual needs and commitments of the European Union. I would like to remind you that the above resolution of the European Parliament stipulates that the Preliminary Draft Budget presented by the Commission is insufficient and fails from a budgetary viewpoint to reflect commonly agreed-upon political ambitions, in particular those related to the Lisbon Strategy and the need to support small and medium-seized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We also invited the Council to enter into a serious and constructive dialogue with the European Parliament concerning the ways to fulfil these political commitments. It is impossible to reach our policy goals, that is, growth of the economy and enhancement of competitiveness, without increased allocations for research, innovation and SMEs, which account for about 90 of all enterprises of the European Union. We, the European Parliament, have stressed before and would like to point out once again the important external assistance programmes that could not be foreseen while considering the current financial perspective, for instance those related to Afghanistan and Iraq, and the recently proposed post-tsunami reconstruction package. In the Preliminary Draft Budget, expenditure heading IV ‘External Actions’ was already insufficiently funded in our opinion. And now the Council proposes a further reduction of allocations under this heading. I would also like to draw your attention to other alarming reductions related to specific thematic and geographical measures. I believe that the budget amounts and resources must be reconciled anew. I would also like to emphasise the importance of the European Neighbourhood Policy including support to democratic developments in the neighbouring States.</p>
<p class="contents">I must reiterate that the accession of ten new Member States in 2004, which is only the beginning of a long-lasting cohesion process, is a new challenge to the cohesion policy, meaning that the implementation of the cohesion policy should focus on regions in order to avoid possible future conflicts between the new Member States and the less developed regions of the EU-15. I would like to conclude by once again calling on the Council to be guided by the priorities established by the European Parliament in drafting the 2006 budget. I strongly believe that there is no need to remind you that the European Parliament is the only European institution directly elected by EU citizens and in accordance with EU law has been assigned a mission in the formation and implementation of the European Union budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that with particular reference to the EUR 150 million cut – for that is what I call it – in payments. Over recent years, we have endeavoured, by introducing the N+2 rules, to tie expenditure very closely to commitments and to ensure that the money is actually spent. We are, basically, being penalised for our efforts by seeing how there is EUR 150 million less available for payments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, though, also punishing ourselves, the European Union as a whole, for, at some point in time, we will be called on to stand by the commitments we have made. We have always, as a matter of policy, kept the gap between payments and commitments from getting too large. In the preliminary draft budget, the Commission really has made only the absolute minimum necessary available in terms of funding for structural policy. We want to get them restored, and I urge the Council to follow our lead in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is in itself unacceptable, but what is particularly unacceptable is the fact that more than one third of these cuts relate to external relations and external affairs. The proposed reduction in expenditures on external affairs is ten times greater than in any other area. The successes and achievements of the European Union to date have been related in no small measure to external relations. We are proud of enlargement, and of our aid policy; we are proud of the fact that we are the world’s biggest donor. These priorities are nevertheless absent from the draft, and most conspicuously so from the Council proposals. Indeed, not only are they absent; the reductions would affect these programmes most of all. Yet I believe that today we very much need to be able to demonstrate successes. Europe, the European Union is crying out for such successes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is also another problem. We are failing to take our own principles seriously; we have failed to do so up to now, and we are failing to do so in this draft. The Council has virtually never invoked the human rights clause. We support a multitude of countries that make a mockery of democracy and human rights. And yet we have a tool at our disposal to do something, since the human rights clause provides the possibility of withdrawing support from countries that fail to observe human rights and the rule of law and it also allows us to increase the support we give to countries that observe these rules. One example would be the countries of the western Balkans. You, on the other hand, propose making even greater reductions in the support we provide to the western Balkan countries than in overall spending on foreign affairs. And yet it is in our fundamental interest to stabilise the western Balkan region. It is incomprehensible that the Council should want to give 5% less to this region, and 8% less to Serbia, for example, than in the previous year. At the same time, it is very generous as regards European special envoys, whose budget has been set to double over two years. In other words, there is to be an increase in something that is of questionable necessity, while at the same time there are to be reductions affecting things that we vitally need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for that reason that I will be forthright in criticising the Council proposal on one score: it is far too cautious and envisages cuts that are massive when seen alongside those proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make clear what I mean by calling this budget transitional, let us take a look at the Böge report and at what we expect of the Financial Perspective. There is a major difference between us and the Council; it adds up to EUR 106 billion in the Financial Perspective. We believe that, in order to make Europe truly fit for the future, we have to focus on quite specific target areas: research, education, youth, cultural interchange in an enlarged Europe, the environment and renewable energies – and I have recent events in New Orleans in mind when I say that.</p>
<p class="contents">A look at the budget figures in Parliament’s financial perspective and, now, in the Council draft for 2006 reveals that they diverge to a marked degree: the Financial Perspective makes EUR 10 billion available for research, but the Council a mere EUR 4 billion; there are EUR 2 billion for education, culture and young people, over against the Council’s mere EUR 0.8 billion for the same period. For energy and transport, Parliament has proposed EUR 2.5 billion, but the Council no more than EUR 1.3 billion. From that alone, it is apparent that the Council’s proposals for the 2006 financial year are timid, cautious and lacking virtually any concept of future direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the draft budget for 2006 ought, instead, to be a sort of bridge extending into the years that are to come, from 2007 to 2013, and so putting forward such timid and paltry budget estimates as the Council has done is the wrong way to go about things. The figures it has quoted to us bear no relation either to the pious utterance about Lisbon as a means of renewal or to the great economic potential that we have to rebuild.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the communications strategy, let me say that, especially after the failure of the referenda, it must surely be in our interest to do more in 2006, rather than to cut payments or make less use of the flexibility instrument. I find it incomprehensible in political terms how, in the face of the many challenges we have to contend with across the globe, the Council can be so timid and cautious in its handling of the flexibility instrument, instead of demonstrating the European Union’s willingness to be a global player in meeting the needs of the world’s many crisis hotspots. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has always been difficult to agree on anything in the summer, but this year it was especially difficult. In practical terms, nothing was agreed on, and, as a result, Parliament is free to undertake its own first reading without any commitments to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">From my group’s point of view, the basic problems are the low level of budget payment appropriations and the budget’s main areas of focus. In the Council there is a group of so-called net contributing countries, which are not interested in the value added that results from financing the Union by way of different joint projects. Virtually the only thing that the Council seems to be actively interested in financing is the militarisation of the EU. Although warfare does not fall within the competence of the EU, the Member States want to finance joint militarisation projects with EU money. As far as I understand, the Congo police operation and the mission in Sudan are being financed out of development appropriations, and the funding of militarisation activities is therefore not transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Constitution, which was rejected in two referenda, is not immediately forthcoming, the political elite in the Member States are implementing some of the articles contained in it, and are establishing, for example, an Armaments, Research and Capabilities Agency. The way that the Member States behave is undemocratic, and it is very obvious that many EU joint military activities have no legal basis in the Treaties. Instead of the militarisation of the EU, we should start to talk about building a social Europe. Only that way will the work of the Union acquire legitimacy, which is to say the general approval of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of a social Europe, our group has continually criticised the narrow scope of the Lisbon Strategy; because it merely promotes a Europe of major companies. We recently criticised the way the Council has kept its eyes and ears firmly closed and cut expenditure, even when compared to the Commission’s draft budget, with the aim of reducing appropriations in the budget to 1% of the Gross National Income of the EU states. Stringent budgetary discipline is a good thing, but in this case the Council is advocating a sound thrashing.</p>
<p class="contents">A strategic objective is also there for us all to see. In the event of no agreement being reached on the financial frameworks and the matter being referred to the budgetary procedure within the meaning of Article 272 of the Treaty, the grand total for the 2006 budget must, from the point of view of the Council, be as small as possible. This is a strategic objective that we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is also concerned about the strategy whereby the costs of sudden and unexpected expenditure, such as that relating to the tsunami, are to be covered by allocating for new purposes money that had been set aside for purposes approved by Parliament. If new, external needs arise, we have to be prepared to allocate new, ‘fresh’ money for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that we need to safeguard Structural Funds payments and increase human resources for the needs of enlargement. It is very difficult for us in Parliament to understand the conflict which prevails between the Commission and the Council with regard to their views on personnel requirements and the need for increased human resources as a result of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of this, I do not believe we should decide that the surplus from the 2004 budget should be used for expenditure in the 2005 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the structural fund, which is already growing in size through this expenditure, needs to become larger. It already amounts to more than EUR 8 billion. I do not therefore agree that I am expressing my displeasure at money not being spent. There are obviously reasons for money not being spent, and there is therefore nothing to be lost in examining issues extremely carefully when it comes to new expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not, however, prepared to return these surpluses to the Member States. I believe, instead, that these funds should be used for the flexibility margin which, in my view, is too small. Otherwise, we shall often end up in situations in which we have to acknowledge that we cannot do what is necessary. We cannot foresee the future. I therefore believe that these resources should be used for developing the flexibility margin and not for developing structural funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our only option was to look on enviously as past conflicts were overcome by means of economic cooperation. We believed at the time, and we continue to believe today, that development and solidarity are the main goals of the European Union, which Poland eventually joined.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet any satisfaction one might derive from this fact is marred by developments that are now becoming ever more evident in certain net payer countries. These developments are a result not only of an economic slow-down, but also of governing principles of action. Excessive labour costs are reducing the competitiveness of these economies, and their overregulation leads to budgetary deficits. In turn, the latter make these countries more inclined to cut back on their payments to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The current state of progress on the 2006 EU budget is a cause for great concern. The Council has once again made cuts to the Commission’s proposal, reducing it by over EUR 1 billion to 1.01% of GNI. This is a bad sign, all the more so because the deadlock on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 has also not been broken. If the Financial Perspective has not been adopted by spring of next year, the reduced 2006 budget could serve as the basis for future budgets, and the worrying developments I mentioned a short time ago could persist for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently two approaches to the issue of EU finances. The first of these favours spending on development to the detriment of agricultural subsidies, whilst the second gives preference to the social dimension of the EU project over the Lisbon Strategy. It would appear that the first of these approaches promotes development at the expense of solidarity, whereas the second promotes solidarity at the expense of development, but it would be mistaken to believe that development and solidarity are alternatives to each other.

Compared with 2005, the European Commission proposed a 4% increase in commitments and a 5.9% increase in payments. As a percentage of the GNP, this amounts to just 2% in the case of payments, which is far below the imaginary ceiling of the long-term financial perspective. The draft budget for 2006 further widened the gap between the commitments and the payments, as well as between available resources of national budgets and the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of funds to cover key EU policies has therefore been a subject of criticism in the first stage of the discussion about the proposed budget in the European Parliament. This is the reason why the budget proposed by the Council came as a cold shower, as it leaves no room for manoeuvre between the proposals of the European Commission and of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A more detailed analysis of adjustments to the budget of the European Commission shows that an overriding majority of 51 items in which the European Council has intervened compared with 2005 (46 items) maintain the trend set in the European Commission’s draft budget. Council’s interventions therefore evoke the impression of a technocratic reduction in expenditures under the motto ‘let us cut by one half the increase in expenditures exceeding those of 2005’, and the motto ‘let us take away more where the expenditures are lower than in 2005’.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach by the European Council undermines the atmosphere of mutual trust in the current budgeting process, and could lead to a protracted position war between the key institutions of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One in five people worldwide have no access to basic education or basic health care, and the chasm is growing every day despite all the pledges by Heads of Government. Europe is the world’s largest donor and can make the difference. That is why we are not asking for more funds in the first instance, but we are asking, within the EU’s aid budget, for priority to be given to the Millennium Objectives. At least 35% of the budget should be spent on these, at least 20% of which should go to basic education and basic health care. Within the various geographical budget lines, we have set aside 20% for those two sectors, and we will not hand this over to the Commission until they have shown us specific plans for basic education and basic health care in those regions.</p>

The finance ministers have, however, almost ritually sat down together and slashed away at every possible area. These have primarily been within foreign policy, but payments to structural funds and for internal policy have also to bear the brunt, and that is rather surprising in the light of the far better implementation we have seen in recent years of, for example, the structural fund programmes. Research has been cut back, as have the funds for supporting other projects within the framework of the Lisbon process that EU Heads of State no doubt still want to keep going. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe particularly regret the slashing of programmes for developing small and medium-sized businesses – programmes that, for example, help the banks make credit available to small businesses in the new Member States where, with limited resources, a large dispersal effect has been achieved, benefiting economic development. We must also deeply regret savings within the transport area, including those in relation to the new agencies for aviation and maritime safety. Clearly, nothing is too small to escape the axe. Even the subsidy for the successful programme for developing medicines to combat rare diseases is at the receiving end. Mr Lewis spoke of dialogue, and I do hope we can obtain dialogue and cooperation. Unfortunately, we are likely to see a situation in which the budget has to be debated with no agreement on the framework for the 2007-2013 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the context of a crisis of confidence in a Europe that is apparently no longer able to offer its citizens a reformed economic model, a competitive model, a model that is fit to rise to the great challenges of the 21st century, the Heads of State or Government have thought it appropriate to reduce by EUR 150 million the amount of payment appropriations proposed by the Commission. Well, this investment expenditure implemented by the Structural Funds is, as we know and as we keep saying, a major challenge for our European economy. Europe needs more than ever to invest in infrastructures in order to maintain its competitiveness and its jobs, undoubtedly just as much in the new Member States as in the others. This EUR 150 million reduction is therefore out of keeping with the findings made by our Assembly with regard to the new challenges confronting us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the major ecological risk to which the draft budget is exposing our continent, as the budget for the agencies as a whole is being maintained at its previous level, in particular that of the European Maritime Safety Agency which, in the wake of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disasters, was entrusted with the highly important task of implementing better monitoring of discards and of chartering anti-pollution vessels in the event of an accident off our coasts.

<p class="contents">The Commission has cut the budget for agricultural policy, especially for the guarantees section, by approximately EUR 1.9 billion below the financial limit, on the basis of unrealistic forecasts for purchases of agricultural products in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture has made an unexplained linear cut in spending of a further EUR 150 million. The result of this overall reduction, which totals approximately EUR 2.2 million, is to create a climate of insecurity for producers, at a time when they are being called upon to apply the new common agricultural policy and the new terms of competition by international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission and the Council be able to address the problems of dairy farmers, of small arable farmers, of wine producers who see quality and <span class="italic">appellation </span>products being ousted from the market, and of sultana producers and fruit producers, as well as the problems of young farmers? Will you reply, 'by strengthening research and technology'? That has already been reduced under the Council proposals and has already been reduced by the financial perspectives. In addition, the appropriations for rural development may be exhausted, but they are inadequate to meet the real needs of rural development in the face of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposed appropriations for equal opportunities are concerned, they are inadequate to meet the real needs which arise from the competitive environment.

As far as this economy is concerned, I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is aware of the statistics that show that European expenditure, which falls within the remit of the European Parliament, has increased by 8% over a ten-year period, while Member State expenditure has risen by something like 23%. I do not therefore believe that it is for the Council to teach us a lesson in responsible budget management.</p>
<p class="contents">The cuts are unsurprising, as usual. There will always be cuts in agriculture. I understand that cuts are being made this year because certain budget lines are high and can therefore be cut back. The ad-hoc procedure has been in place since the Amsterdam Treaty. As the Council itself states, we will have a realistic estimate in October. Why not wait for that?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also wants to cut back on pilot projects and preparatory actions. But why? Some of those actions are excellent and certainly now, with avian influenza, we will need to do more in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether, in his view, the Council has kept to the agreements made in 2004 about the Council informing Parliament on the common foreign and security policy on a regular basis and at a high level.

It also reflects the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the funds involved in its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I welcome the Commission’s decision to bring forward the pilot project of the European Year of Workers’ Mobility, I was sorry to learn that at first reading the Council cut the appropriations proposed in the preliminary draft proposal by EUR 2 million. Given that the budget is already low, this reduction amounts to a glaring lack of political will to make this pilot project a success story, rather than merely a desultory campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret the paucity of appropriations for EURES, the essential instrument for developing the single European labour market, which is tantamount to discrimination in relation to the amounts requested and obtained by Parliament this year. The funds earmarked for social dialogue have also been cut in relation to the preliminary draft proposal, which runs counter to Parliament’s position. What is more, the European Social Fund has also seen its proposals reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">At this rate, how can we hope to establish a more social and more competitive Europe? No chance! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council’s 2006 draft budget is based on payment appropriations amounting to 1.01% of the EU’s Gross National Income, which is to say approximately a billion euros above the 1% limit. This, moreover, was achieved by cutting expenditure by half a billion euros as a matter of course. As the new Member States are only just starting to become involved in the EU budget, the Council’s proposal shows that the 1% ceiling for expenditure, as suggested by certain states, will be impossible to put into effect. The 2006 budget will be the last to be drafted with reference to the current financial perspective. Unless a new financial perspective is established, the institutions will find themselves in a situation in which there is no agreement between them, and that would lead to total economic uncertainty and stagnation in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we see it, the funds provided are simply not adequate to facilitate the proper implementation of European environmental and health policy and our policy on the safety of food. We now have 25 Member States, yet there is to be only less than a 1% increase for environmental matters, and, in public health, no increase whatever beyond the 2005 level. That alone is ridiculous enough in the eyes of some Members, but now the Council has excelled itself by cutting the estimates, which were low enough in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">In their speeches on television and in public, all the members of the Council talk endlessly about their desire to build a citizens’ Europe. Here in this plenary, we have just heard that there is to be another rise in people’s standard of living in Europe, even though the funding for such a policy is being withheld.

<p class="contents">The position adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism is as follows. Firstly, we wish to boost funding for the implementation of the planned Trans-European Transport Networks by EUR 120 million, and we are opposed to savings in this area.

Thirdly and finally, the Committee unanimously rejected the Council’s proposal, in particular with regard to measures to prevent marine pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Our guiding principle in this respect was that we are helpless in the face of the air and land-based disasters that we experience or witness.
