<p class="contents">The European Union has firmly supported the historic project to establish a permanent international criminal jurisdiction with universal scope. The European Parliament is well aware of this fact since it has always been on the front line in promoting the European Union’s efforts to achieve this essential objective for human rights and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to state once again that the establishment of the International Criminal Court is an important component of the European Union’s external policy, and consequently a feature of the programme of the Spanish Presidency. The European Union particularly welcomes the imminent achievement of this objective, which we have been waiting for such a long time and which we are all confident will take place this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot overstate the importance of the establishment of this Court, which so many legal experts, defenders of human rights and political leaders have been fighting for, and it is now truly within our reach. It will be a triumph for all humanity which is due, in no small measure, to the determined and consistent action of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our collective experience on this continent, which has been involved in conflicts and horrors throughout the last century, makes Europeans particularly sensitive to the absolute need to develop and affirm international criminal justice as an instrument of service to human rights and humanitarian standards worldwide. It can be a surprise to nobody, therefore, that European States and the European Union are at the forefront of this movement in support of the International Criminal Court, a court that will be truly universal, independent and efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is absolutely convinced that the establishment of the International Criminal Court will represent a huge step forward for the whole world. When serious crimes are committed that are an affront to civilised society as a whole, when common values are attacked head on, the international community must act with the full force of the law. We need to enthusiastically and appropriately punish the most serious violations of human rights and international law, using the mechanisms agreed upon within the international community for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Criminal Court will be a powerful tool in this fight for justice and against impunity for the most heinous crimes – war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. In a wider context, the establishment of the International Criminal Court is part of a movement characterised by the evolution of our world in recent times; the emergence and consolidation of an international criminal justice system that pursues particularly heinous crimes beyond the borders of our States, because these crimes are a serious threat to the security of all citizens worldwide. In such cases, which affect us all, we have to call upon either national criminal justice systems, through mechanisms which closely cooperate with one other, or properly constituted international criminal tribunals such as those created for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, set up by the Security Council, or in the near future by the International Criminal Court itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The trial of ex-President Slobodan Milosevic in the Hague which has recently started is just one more example of this tendency that is gathering more momentum throughout the world, for this is what world-wide public opinion demands, and because it has to be seen as the logical conclusion of the current process of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing is that we are winning the battle against this culture of impunity, a culture based upon silence and amnesia, which is being replaced by a culture in which we demand that those responsible for heinous crimes be brought to justice. In the same way, we are moving away from the attitude of turning a blind eye to crimes committed against a neighbour to one where we are involved and look for effective means to act and cooperate with each other in order to deal with these intolerable situations. This does not mean seeking revenge or retaliation, but to ensure that justice prevails as an essential condition for long-lasting peace and reconciliation in every situation where there has been serious conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the preparatory work for the establishment of the International Criminal Court is now at a very advanced stage. Upon the basis of the Statute adopted in Rome in 1998, the preparatory committee has laid down the majority of the instruments that the Court will need to be able to function effectively. In this process, which is undoubtedly of a technical nature but with fundamental scope and importance, EU States continue to play a very important role, I would even dare to say a leading role, in the collective work that has been carried out by countries worldwide. And, even more importantly, the process of ratification of the Rome Statute is advancing at an even faster pace than we could have hoped for. Whilst in the Rome Diplomatic Conference 120 States voted for its adoption, the Treaty has been signed by a total of 139 States, that is to say, an overwhelming majority of the international community. As you already know, 60 ratifications or signatories are needed for the Statute to enter into force and consequently for the International Criminal Court to be set up. At this stage there have been 52 ratifications, which leads us to believe that we will get the 60 ratifications needed within the next few months. I would even dare to say that this will certainly take place before the end of the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are all aware, all the Member States of the European Union have ratified the Statute or have implemented the necessary constitutional mechanisms for it to be ratified in the very near future. We firmly believe that all the Member States will be amongst those countries which, with their participation in the assembly of signatory States, whose first meeting could take place this very year, will implement those concrete decisions which pave the way for the effective operation of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the common position adopted in the Council of 11 June 2001, the European Union urges all States that have not ratified or signed up to the Statute to do so as soon as possible, so that the International Criminal Court can be established in the near future. I would like to point out that recently 15 candidate or associate countries have adopted the common position and are closely cooperating with us on this commitment. It is also appropriate to highlight the work that is being carried out in this regard by a large number of non-governmental organisations, frequently with the assistance and cooperation of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with this appeal, the European Union has been making representations to third countries and groups of countries in order that they can speed up the internal procedures necessary to ratify the Statute as soon as possible. These representations have been accompanied, in certain cases, by offers of technical assistance in this field. In the next few weeks we intend to intensify these representations on various continents with the aim not only of achieving the swift entry into force of the Statute, but also to ensure that the assembly of signatory States reflects as accurately as possible the varied composition of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Court will crucially depend on its composition and the support it receives being interpreted as a genuine reflection of the international community as a whole. It is extremely important that all continents and all legal systems are duly represented in the Court and that this includes lawyers of both sexes as specified in the Rome Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The search for this wide-ranging support for the Court should inspire our efforts. We feel encouraged in our commitment by the fact that the ratifications that have already been registered and those that will take place in the very near future are from States on all continents, predominantly European, African and Latin American States so far, with different legal systems and levels of economic and social development. No one can say that the International Criminal Court is going to be a Court simply for the Western world or developed countries. It will be a legal institution for the whole international community, fully independent and linked to the United Nations system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to point out that all countries, whether they have signed the Statute or not, can play an active role in the process of establishing the International Criminal Court through their participation in the work of the preparatory committee and then, if they so desire, as observers in the assembly of signatory States. And the doors will always be open to any country that wants to ratify or sign up to the Statute at a later date. In this regard, the European Union has maintained a constant and sustained dialogue with several countries harbouring doubts, some of which are our closest allies – I am referring, in particular, to the United States – and we will remain ready to continue these exchanges, with the aim of clarifying respective positions and promoting a favourable atmosphere for cooperation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that this task will not come to a conclusion with the entry into force of the Statute and the decisions that will be adopted in the next meeting of the assembly of signatory States. We will need to take all of the necessary measures so that the establishment of this new institution in its permanent headquarters in the Hague will be as quick and efficient as possible. The preparatory committee and the host country, the Netherlands, are already preparing for the implementation of these measures and the European Union is cooperating with them. Next, we will have to develop and strengthen all the mechanisms that will help the new institution in order to guarantee its effectiveness both in its headquarters and on the ground. The experience of the courts for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda have taught us that international criminal justice, in order to be effective, needs to be equipped with considerable human, material and operational resources. The Court, with its potentially universal scope, will require no less. It will certainly require more. Within this context, the European Union and its Member States will have to be prepared to give any assistance that may prove necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Court, whose proceedings will be governed by the principles of complementarity and cooperation with national legal systems, will only be able to operate effectively if it can rely upon the cooperation of the judicial and administrative authorities of the States. This means that a very substantial proportion of the implementation of the Statute will consist of the adoption of measures on a national level to make this cooperation possible. This corresponds to each State in accordance with their constitutional practices, but the European Union can help in this process through the exchange of information and, when appropriate, the offer of technical assistance to countries that need it.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is taking place on the basis of the common position adopted in June 2001, which I mentioned earlier, which, if necessary, could be supplemented by a more detailed action plan or, when appropriate, through an updating or refining of its terms depending on the progress of the process. I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will pay very close attention to the ideas that arise from this debate when it comes to taking decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we share a firm commitment to supporting the swift and efficient establishment of the International Criminal Court as an independent and impartial institution devoted to carrying out justice in the worst cases of violations of human rights and humanitarian law throughout the world. In this regard, all of us, the European Parliament, the Council, Member States and the Commission, are closely united and committed to continuing to act with determination and tenacity. This conviction, this determination, is what has allowed the European Union to play an unquestionably leading role in this process, together with other countries characterised by their attachment to democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very close to achieving our objective through the entry into force of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the Court. This will provide us with a ‘before’ and an ‘after’ in the history of humanity’s effort to introduce justice throughout the world. We will therefore be able to feel proud of Europe’s contribution to this progress in the international community, but we will by no means be able to rest on our laurels, for this will be the moment at which we have to move on to the next stage in this struggle for justice, in which Europe will again have an indispensable role to play. I am sure, Mr President, that we will lack neither the will nor the consistency to be able to persevere in our commitment, and, for this reason, I believe I will always be able to count on the support of this Parliament.</p>

The statute of the International Criminal Court, concluded in Rome, represents probably the most significant achievement of international law since the establishment of the United Nations. The European Union has always advocated the International Criminal Court and continues to support this project vigorously, as demonstrated by the common position adopted by the EU in June 2001, in which we put the case for the agreed statute to enter into force as soon as possible and for the Court to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission unreservedly approves the start made in this common position, and I, too, wholeheartedly concur with what Ramón de Miguel has just set out in his capacity as President of the Council. The Commission welcomes the official statement in January 2002 by the Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, as well as by Cyprus and Malta, countries also associated with it, and the EFTA countries belonging to the European Economic Area, to the effect that they associate themselves with the objectives of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's budget is being used to support projects by non-governmental organisations, by means of which projects the whole world is to be made aware of the need for the Court to be established. Since 1995, then, within the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, some EUR 6.9 million have to date been spent on projects of this sort. EUR 2.1 million were made available in 2001 for three projects by non-governmental organisations in support of the International Criminal Court, which complement each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘NGO Coalition for the Criminal Court’ project aims to facilitate civil society's involvement, in cooperation with governments, within the framework of the United Nations' Preparatory Committee for the Criminal Court, and promote and facilitate technical cooperation, so that binding national legislation can be enacted to implement the statute concluded in Rome once it is ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">The project ‘Parliamentarians for Global Action’ is engaged in a parliamentary campaign to ratify and effectively implement the statute of the Criminal Court and promote the rule of law, and the project ‘No peace without justice’ concentrates on campaigns to build public awareness and organise conferences in support of the Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In the May 2001 Commission communication on the role of human rights and democratisation in third countries, the combating of unpunished crime was ranked as a measure to be promoted as a high priority. The Commission will therefore continue to support the establishment of the International Criminal Court. EUR 5 million has been allocated to the special budget line for the International Criminal Court, which also includes the ad hoc courts for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and also the newly-established court for Sierra Leone, for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, the Commission will be concentrating its efforts on two aspects, firstly on increasing awareness of the Criminal Court, as part of which it wants to call on more than the necessary sixty countries to proceed with ratification, so that the statute can enter into force, whilst, at the same time, wanting to ensure that all areas of the globe are represented.</p>
<p class="contents">We want, secondly, to concentrate on the enactment of binding national legislation to implement the plan; this would cover the training of the specialised staff involved – judges, lawyers, law enforcement agency staff and parliamentarians – to enable them to contribute to the work of the Court. We can also make a limited contribution to covering the Court's main costs. Proposals as to how to realise these objectives will be invited in March this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their statements dovetail perfectly with what the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents">We also fully share their views on the significance of the Court. If we talk about the need for reconciliation, then it is true that justice is to be done first, and the Criminal Court that has been set up for this purpose is therefore an extremely important instrument for ensuring the international rule of law, particularly in its preventive effect on people with dubious criminal backgrounds who have acquired high political positions, as we have witnessed in Yugoslavia and near the Great Lakes in Africa. It is of the utmost importance for impunity to be no longer acceptable and for this now also to be universally known.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolutions submitted by Parliament contain a few important points. First of all, we as groups mutually agreed during the negotiations to urge the President and the Congress of the United States to review their position on taking part in the International Criminal Court. We have such high regard for the US that we need to make this appeal in a proper manner. This is why I also deem the amendment in this connection, which concerns an old document from the negotiations, to be wholly inappropriate. It makes no sense to try to convince the Americans by using tough words. Instead, we should prevent the irritation, which is already in evidence among the Americans in respect of Europe, from escalating any further and try to discuss these matters in a friendly manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is the need for the provisions of the Geneva Convention with regard to prisoners of war to be updated, so that we can take account of the status of the people currently held in Guatanamo. We, as a group, set great store by providing a definition in this connection. In addition, we hope that the Spanish Presidency will succeed in setting up this International Criminal Court under its own presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There have been 52 ratifications of the Statute to date but, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all well aware, 60 are needed for it to enter into force. Given that we anticipate that the International Criminal Court will enter into force in the first six months of this year, under the Spanish Presidency, that the first assembly of signatory States will take place in New York, in September this year, that the attitude of the United States has not been positive so far and there are also well-founded suspicions that the American administration will be supporting a campaign against the Court, even going as far as to revoke Clinton’s signature at the UN on 31 December 2000, I would like to take advantage of your presence here, Mr de Miguel, to ask you a few specific questions.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Presidency of the Union intend to do with regard to the Bush administration to avoid this risk of taking a backwards step? Does the Presidency not think it necessary to draw up a plan with specific measures and resources to attract the United States to the International Criminal Court? What does the Presidency of the Union intend doing to guarantee that the 18 aforementioned judges, an integral component of this Court, designated at national level, meet with the requirements with regard to qualifications, balanced regional distribution, experience and parity between men and women?</p>
<p class="contents">When the Rome Statute was approved, Kofi Annan considered it a gigantic step forward. However, a long time ago, Benjamin Ferencz, former prosecutor at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trial, said that there can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, and no meaningful law without a court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstances. Today, following 11 September and the conflicts in the Middle East, the citizens see the establishment of this Court as something urgent and necessary. Let us not, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let time slip away and forget about this until the next crime or war reminds us of this ever-present threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If all individuals are not treated in the same way, if war crimes and crimes against humanity go unpunished, how can we credibly pass judgment on less serious violations of the law? It is of the utmost importance for a permanent International Criminal Court now to be set up specifically in The Hague, the judicial capital of the world. This court is one element in the development of our civilisation. It should naturally be universal. Asian and Arab countries, in particular, are still under-represented, and I urge all signatories to proceed to ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very poignant that the United States too should refuse to ratify the Treaty. It was mainly the Americans who proclaimed in Nuremberg that individuals have duties towards the international community which prevail over those towards their own State, and that this should become international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, for the Americans, the same international criminal law apparently applies to everyone apart from themselves. A rare insight into the arrogance of power is provided by a bill that has already been adopted by the Senate and that boycotts the court and every country which participates in it. Another outrageous bill would even authorise the President of the United States to use violence to liberate people kept in prison by the court. If sufficient guarantees are built in to ensure a fair judicial process and competent judges, there is no reason at all why America should be fearful of this court. The Council and our Parliament should get this message across to our counterparts in America in a friendly, yet unambiguous manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, as many countries as possible, spread across the different continents, should proceed to ratification in the short term. The court should not become too European. It can prove in practice that States that do not participate are in the wrong. Anyone who refuses to recognise the International Criminal Court commits an injustice and lags behind our civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first obstacle is the persistently hostile attitude of the United States. We call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to make it clear, once again, at all formal and informal meetings with the United States, how much importance Europe attaches to this issue. It would be genuinely feasible to find some creative instruments to put pressure on the United States, and I believe this has not been seriously attempted.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem concerns the difficult issue of internal rules to bring national legislation into line with the Court’s Statute. This will certainly be a difficult process but we must not allow it to become too drawn-out. From this point of view, I would genuinely like to express my pleasure at Commissioner Verheugen’s words to the effect that he and the Commission are in favour of supporting the training of specialists to help the Court operate more effectively, not least by providing financial aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important thing, however, is that we can see the values of justice and of the fight against impunity spreading to the five continents. Slowly, it is true, but spreading nonetheless. We are also pleased to note that the forthcoming establishment of the ICC will contribute on a different scale to the rejection of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be added that justice is only justice if it applies to everyone in the same way. We know that the ICC is not and never will be perfect. It will often appear to be dispensing ‘winners’ justice’, but, in addition to its normal jurisdictional function of investigating and prosecuting particularly serious crimes, it will also perform two other highly relevant tasks: one is to act as a deterrent to prevent further crimes being committed and the other is to provide compensation and reparations for the victims. It should also be pointed out that the International Court will only take action if national criminal authorities are not proceeding with the investigation and the prosecution of crimes, either because their laws do not cover such crimes or because the authorities are not able to proceed. We consider this to be a satisfactory solution as long as it is properly applied to the difficult problem of the conflict between the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the sovereignty of the national criminal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the impartiality and the independence of the ICC are fundamental values and are part of the defence of what is the greatest asset of the European Union: the respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms, as well as the Rule of Law. We should, therefore, take every opportunity to praise the objectives that have led to the creation of the Court, and these objectives should not be disparaged under any circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, the Commission officials and the Council for their constant focus on the matter and for their openness to society, Parliamentary group and NGO initiatives, for I feel that a model of cooperation has emerged from this exercise – which we have already applied, for example to the treaty on antipersonnel mines – which is proving effective and therefore warrants due analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has been made here of some of the countries which have not ratified the Statute. There are others, from Russia to China, which should, perhaps, also be mentioned or be the subject of focus. Fifty-five countries have ratified the Statute, and I feel that our efforts must now be directed towards achieving a political and geographical balance. The endeavours made at the Seville Conference, for example, to include the Arab countries, the very positive, unexpected stance adopted by the Arab League and the recent statements by the Mexican President, Vicente Fox, give rise to the hope that, with further endeavours, we might not merely achieve that quota but, I believe, even attempt to take a flying leap beyond it and make participation as universal as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, I feel that, as in other cases, Europe can be proud of these 10 years of dogged, resolute, difficult hard work, in which it was alone at the outset but which is now widely recognised. The attention accorded to the special courts of accountability too, such as the Sierra Leone court which is about to be set up, is evidence that, when it so wishes, Europe can also be a community of values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, some European States have still not done so. It is therefore crucial that we encourage them to sign up.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1995, this Parliament has been working towards the creation of this criminal court, and subsequently, in 1998, the Rome Conference very clearly stated the work that needed to be done to set it up. We are at the end of this process, but, perhaps, at this point, an effort must be made to get 60 signatories to the Statute. However, Mr President, I would also like to say to the Spanish Presidency that all this effort is only worth it if the end result is significant. In order for this to be an instrument of fundamental importance, we need a whole series of working and operating mechanisms. I would ask the Spanish Presidency, during whose term of office the Statute for the International Criminal Court will in all likelihood be approved, to put all its efforts into ensuring that the court will have the sufficient means to be able to function as it should. This has been Parliament’s concern since 1995: that this struggle for a future that is more just will be successful and that this International Criminal Court will take on the crucially important role that it should have in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
