I should like very specifically to draw attention to the delegation of MEPs that visited the country to assess the damage produced by the floods in the state of Vargas. When it returned, this delegation drew up a resolution and mobilised considerable financial resources in order to express the EU’s solidarity with those affected.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament’s most recent official delegation to Venezuela detected the possible risk of an anti-democratic trend whose most important manifestation was the cancellation of the Venezuelan parliamentarians’ mandate before the Latin American Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the country is undergoing a political, economic and social crisis that has produced many victims, as did similar crises this weekend in Colombia and, in the past, in Bolivia. Moreover, this is actually contrary to Venezuela’s peaceful traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that the European Union in general and our Parliament in particular have to support the efforts of the Organisation of American States and of the ‘Group of Friends’ to try to bring about a situation in which the country is in some way able once again to feel the beat of economic and social development and to embark upon the path of stability, democratic consolidation and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission must, however, help us in this task and, of course, the measures taken the day before yesterday by the Commission to limit and modify the system of generalised Community preferences are not going to be of much help in handling the situations being experienced by Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Parliament must respond and lose no time in setting out its priorities for helping these countries, which are subject to many threats. In the case of Venezuela, moreover, we have to obtain a peaceful, negotiated and democratic solution, given the grave situation being experienced by that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group condemns the instigators of the <span class="italic">coup</span> of 11 April who irresponsibly attempted to overthrow the country’s democratic, legitimate constitutional institutions. Most of all, we condemn the Council of the European Union’s complicity with the instigators of the <span class="italic">coup</span> at the time. We have not yet forgotten that the Presidency of the Union immediately sent a message of support to the instigators of the <span class="italic">coup</span>, a black day<span class="bold"> </span>for European diplomacy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to respect the Venezuelan Constitution, which was drawn up by a democratically elected assembly and equally democratically ratified by a huge majority by the Venezuelan citizens. Indeed, the anti-governmental action against the government instigated by the part of the opposition known as the Democratic Coordinator lies completely outside the framework of the Venezuelan Constitution and, moreover, only served the economic and commercial interests of forces outside Venezuela which had no hesitation in reducing the entire country to poverty in order to continue to enjoy privileges and pursue specific goals. This does not, of course, mean that we blindly support all the actions of the legitimate Venezuelan Government.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the moderating action of the <span class="italic">Mesa de negociaciones y acuerdos </span>working in Venezuela and we support the mediating work of the Carter Foundation, based on respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, which has several times been expressed democratically. It is important to remember that President Chavez has, on a number of occasions, declared that he is willing to respect the provisions of the Venezuelan Constitution and to submit to public consultation half way through his mandate. Respecting the political experiment in Venezuela means respecting the dignity of a people that has decided to take its fate into its own hands. We too have a responsibility to further this process and to ensure that the complexity of the situation in Latin America, not least, does not become such as to constantly jeopardise the autonomy of its people.</p>
<p class="contents">That is another reason why our group calls for the motion for a resolution we have drawn up together to be adopted without amendments.</p>

This is a Venezuela that, in the past year, has experienced two completely new events in its domestic life that, in institutional, political, economic and social terms, have changed the ways in which the country can be governed. Firstly, there was a mini <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> on 11 April to oust President Chavez, who had been elected in 1998 in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution. Secondly, there was a civil strike, initiated at the beginning of December, which constituted a significant breach of the social fabric. Nor ought the issue of oil to be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this scenario of socio-political confrontation and crisis, government and opposition have turned to the international community in search of support in finding a negotiated democratic solution. To that extent, the European Union cannot remain on the margins because, over and above the response of democratic solidarity it needs to offer in the light of this serious problem facing Venezuela, it must take account of the fact that hundreds of thousands, not to say millions, of citizens of EU Member States reside there. That is why I think it right for this Parliament to get involved and actively help Venezuela to emerge from the crisis it is experiencing while, of course, respecting its sovereignty and independence. To that extent, I should be grateful if we were all to support the motion for a resolution. I should also like, however, to see support for the amendment tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, asking for the European emigrants living in Venezuela not to be forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in Portugal have been extremely sad and distressed to see what is happening to Venezuela; a country that is a friend of ours, where hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens live, especially from Madeira.</p>
<p class="contents">The ties that bind us to the Venezuelan people and State run very deep. It distresses us to see the destruction of what was one of the most solid democracies and one of the most prosperous, stable and peaceful societies in Latin America. The unfortunate mandate of President Chavez, who it is true, was elected, bears enormous responsibility. It appears that he wanted to pursue a policy of inflaming Latin America, which is what unfortunately happened a few decades ago, with terrible consequences, including the violence that still besets so many Latin American countries that are friends of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support this resolution, but would like to make some clarifications, not only on the amendment we tabled, but also on a split vote that we requested. We believe that our role is to encourage moderation, dialogue, the progress of democracy and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our expression of respect for the Constitution, as included in the text, could be used improperly in Venezuela by one of the parties involved. We are, of course, in favour of respect for the democratic Constitution, but we know that with regard to the issues concerning Venezuela currently being discussed, this is an argument that President Chavez has used improperly to block or to attempt to block the course of democracy in his country. Consequently, if we use the argument improperly in this context, we could be sending out the wrong signal. This is why we have requested a split vote for which we would also ask the Chamber’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the crisis in Venezuela’s two-party regime led to a solution’s being sought in terms of what we might call the populist panacea. What had happened is that, after 40 years of relative political stability, the two-party regime had been discredited as a result of accusations of corruption and malfunctioning of the democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution took the form of a regime that, to most intents and purposes, was plebiscitary in character, with a new constitution and with a president possessing considerable popular support but in which the democratic institutions did not operate properly.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, this is not a phenomenon exclusive to Latin America. In Europe, too, there is a certain tendency at the present time to look for solutions in this type of populism, involving the discrediting of parliamentary and representative institutions. I believe that we can say, like Winston Churchill, that ‘parliamentary democracy is the worst political system … except for all the others’, and I think that the Venezuelans will now have to reflect upon the new type of constitution they want.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not, however, for us to tell the Venezuelans what to do. The motion for a resolution is not designed to recommend one course rather than another to the Venezuelans. It is the result of a compromise between various political forces, and that is why we, at this time, are rejecting the proposals for split votes on some aspects of the resolution tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, even though we do in fact support his amendment about acknowledging the situation of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">What would be required would be for the European Parliament, together with other Community institutions, to intervene to help create a climate of understanding between the Venezuelans themselves. This Parliament already has experience of intervening in crises, for example in Central America – more specifically, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala – as well as in South America: more specifically, Chile and Paraguay.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an intervention, made in conjunction with parliamentarians from Latin America, could be useful in creating this climate of confidence required by Venezuela if it is to function properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hoped never again to have to discuss attempted <span class="italic">coups d’Etat</span> or situations in which the democratic institutions might be overturned. Moreover, we would point out that the same President Chavez who is now under threat and was in danger from a <span class="italic">coup d’Etat</span> in April 2002 had himself attempted a <span class="italic">coup d’Etat</span>. It is clear, therefore, that these types of methods have, in any case, not yet been completely eradicated from the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the worst is now passed. We welcome this fact and we therefore support the resolution to this effect. We welcome the increasing attempts at dialogue which are taking shape and we are also convinced that the international role, the positive role being played by the Group of Friends and the Organisation of American States, is certainly a positive innovation in Latin America, where mediation in internal affairs is by no means the norm. We also feel that the crisis in this country, consisting principally of the strikes and boycotting in the oil sector, has led to destabilisation which is not entirely coincidental. I wonder what the European Union can do in this regard and I fully endorse what Mr Salafranca has just said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows the particular solidarity that they feel, but I actually also want to make it clear that this problem of Venezuela concerns all Europeans to at least some degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Venezuela is a country that plays a significant role, and not only in economic terms thanks to its raw materials, oil and many other natural resources. It is a country that has made a very considerable contribution to the political stability of the Andean region over a very long period of time. That is why I welcome the efforts that Europe is making to help this country to recover its internal stability by intervening here. I should particularly like to thank Mr Salafranca and others for being so ready to take on this task time and time again, and I believe that there are two points in this motion that are very significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, emphasis is placed on the role of the Friends of Venezuela, this group of countries that is making a particular effort to offer mediation here. Two countries in the European Union, namely Spain and Portugal, belong to this group and have a special responsibility here, which they are responding to magnificently. I should like to thank them for this and say that the European Union hopes that Spain and Portugal really can play a pivotal and positive role here, and I am convinced that they will do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the motion stresses how important it is for the European Parliament itself to have a presence on the spot. I should like to underline this request and say that the European Parliament certainly does not want to interfere in politics the world over, but it does wish to offer good mediation services wherever a reasonably well-functioning democracy is in danger because it is under threat from populism on the one hand and fear and uncertainty on the other. The various different political forces need to be brought together around one table, because only by strengthening the rule of law, only by strengthening the institutions, but also only by strengthening pluralism in this troubled country will we once again be able to avoid a serious crisis there, and the lasting damage that this would do to that country and the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, I would therefore appeal for the European Parliament's offer to act as a mediator to be accepted. I do not mean that we want to go around telling other nations what to do. We do not have the right to do that, but we do have the duty to make our good offices available and to act as mediators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their inability to enter into a dialogue is causing society, and even the State itself to fragment, leaving behind a vacuum that other undemocratic groups are only too eager to fill.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I should therefore like to draw your attention to the fact that an initiative has emerged from the Latin American Parliament and the European Parliament to form a joint group, to establish a dialogue with Members of Parliament on both sides in Venezuela and in this way also to support the efforts of the Group of Friends of Venezuela to bring the two sides together. I hope that it will eventually be possible for us to build this bridge.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I suspect that given the current crisis in Iraq, the longer this conflict lasts the more likely it is that the oil involved will lead the United States to call for action to be taken. The fact that well over 10% of America's oil comes from Venezuela is not without its consequences for them, or for the other countries of Latin America either, because rises in the price of oil are due, at least in part, to the situation in Venezuela. The man in the street in the countries of Latin America is the one who will pay.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from getting the two sides talking, what else is to be done? I think that sooner or later we will have no alternative but to let the people decide. Here, though, I think it is important to keep the constitution as a basis, because despite all of its shortcomings the validity of this constitution has not been contested. Latin America's reputation for not respecting constitutions goes before it. This is all the more reason for us to ensure that where a constitution is actually recognised at international level, we do stick to it. If it is to be amended then it should be with the agreement of both sides to perhaps enable elections to be held at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">But as I see it the only way out seems to be for the people to decide, and no one else!</p>
