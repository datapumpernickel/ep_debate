It has already happened in Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more recently in Togo, and may well happen soon in Egypt as well. It sometimes happens that elections are announced to decide the succession, but it is known in advance who will emerge from them as the victor. In Togo, this step was missed out; the Gnassingbé family took power by violent means from the Olympio family a long time ago, and they want to hold on to it. An amendment to the constitution, accomplished in the twinkling of an eye following the death of the Head of State, prevented the President of the country’s parliament from succeeding him temporarily and preparing new presidential elections in good time, and instead made it possible for his son to take over the state as if he were the heir to private property. The fact is that the son is in no more legitimate a position than his father; what is happening is the continuation of a long-past <span class="italic">coup d'état</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Continuing this state of affairs has robbed Togo of the hope that it, having been a German and then a French colonial possession, and then for a long time a home-grown dictatorship, might develop into a democracy. Up to now, it has been cause for popular lamentation that power has almost always been in the hands of profiteers who were supported by military might and were not concerned with serving the national interest; their concern was rather with taking up their privileged positions. Not only in Togo, not only in Africa, but throughout the world too, this state of affairs must come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of being selective in our outrage at what is happening in Togo, let us help to put a stop to the military and economic protection of regimes of this kind. That is what matters at the present moment. The unfortunate fact that it is the rule rather than an exception means that we have to ensure that these events do not repeat themselves and that it would be a good thing if free elections could be held in Togo within a short period of time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Togo is similar to many other West African countries in that it is an artificial state, created to serve colonial interests, and indeed one only needs to glance at a map to see this, as Togo, in common with most other West African countries, is shaped like a narrow handkerchief. Togo was governed first by German and then by French colonial masters, but its borders were imposed artificially, and initially there was very little chance of it enduring in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that Togo’s borders were drawn on a drawing board, with entire peoples and families being torn apart in the process, and other ethnic groups that had nothing in common being artificially merged, it must be said that in spite of this the country made every appearance of developing remarkably well for a number of years. It appeared to be an island of stability in West Africa, even though we are all aware that there have barely been any real democracies in our sense of the word in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet Eyadéma’s rule, as Mr Meijer has pointed out, has come ever more to resemble an extremely violent dictatorship, and attempts are now being made to put it on a hereditary basis. Without wishing to deny the fact that families and tribes have a different meaning in Africa than in our societies, it must be said that we cannot accept this hereditary dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">Our demands are therefore quite clear; resignation by the President, who came to power illegally, a reinstatement of the parliament’s legitimate President, free elections to be held without delay, and widespread respect for the rule of law and human rights. Above all, one thing must be clear; this time the African Union itself – and this is something I welcome greatly – as well as the West African Economic Community that is forming along the lines of the EU have made it very clear that they do not accept this illegal rule. I should like to thank both these communities, and see this as an encouraging sign that Africa is – albeit hesitantly – beginning to seize its own destiny in such issues, and deserves our full support in so doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trautmann (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, after nearly 38 years of dictatorship by President Eyadéma and with his son Faure Gnassingbé having seized power in defiance of every constitutional rule and the commitment given in Brussels on 14 April 2004 for a return to political dialogue between all forces, Togo is sinking deeper every day into crisis and the risk of civil war. The Togolese people and Togo nationals living in our European countries are looking to the European Parliament and the European Union to take a firm and resolute stance. They want our solidarity and new prospects for their future and that of their children. This requires first of all a genuine return to popular sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two conditions for that. The first is that Faure Gnassingbé must withdraw immediately and without argument and put an end to this hereditary dictatorship that he sought to install by military <span class="italic">coup</span> in defiance of democratic principles and the laws of his country and in violation of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the restoration of constitutional legality and the resumption of pluralist dialogue involving all parties, including of course the opposition parties. Only Mr Natchaba, the speaker of the National Assembly, would be in a position to provide an interim government to prepare for presidential elections in accordance with the constitution. It will only be possible for Mr Natchaba to return to Togo if his safety can be guaranteed, however.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, Mr President, I want to stress the justified concern expressed in this House yesterday by a representative delegation of associations of democratic movements and human rights associations about the real risks that political activists, human rights activists and journalists are running today.</p>
<p class="contents">With my colleague, Marie-Arlette Carlotti, we received them and listened to them with the greatest attention, because some of them, or members of their families, have been physically ill treated and abused under the Eyadéma dictatorship. They made an emotional appeal to us and to all international bodies to take definite concerted action to restore democracy permanently to Togo. Knowing that their country, which is already subject to sanctions, has suffered during the last several years, they nevertheless said they expected us to adopt a firm and tough attitude towards Togo if nothing happens to guarantee the holding of free elections. Our resolution responds to that expectation by referring to sanctions, some of which have already been imposed by the Economic Community of West African States, while others are planned by other international bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I want to stress the need for targeted measures to be taken quickly concerning the supply of arms and transfers of money outside Togo. International bodies must also act to give the population the security necessary for future elections to be prepared for in an atmosphere of calm. It is essential that the political parties should be able to conduct a proper election campaign; it is equally essential that all the media do their duty by providing information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The good news, as Mrs Trautmann has emphasised, is that the Economic Community of West African States responded very quickly and positively. They insisted on the withdrawal of all their ambassadors, they applied trade sanctions, they banned arms sales and stopped issuing visas both for their own citizens to visit Togo and vice versa, for Togolese citizens to visit their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a step in the right direction. We need the rest of the international community to follow that example. The European Community needs to support the democratic forces which, I am glad to say, exist inside Togo. We need to give them encouragement; we need to urge the army to stay in its barracks. As Mrs Trautmann has said, we need to try and work with Mr Natchaba to establish a situation whereby he can return to his country and organise fair and free elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that this <span class="italic">coup d'etat</span> is popular is killed by the fact that, on seizing power, the president has had to ban all public demonstrations for two months. He has closed eight television and radio stations and has made sure that every other voice of opposition is oppressed. This is a coup in every sense of the word and we should show no sympathy for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Incidentally, EU aid to the country has been suspended since 1992, and the unconstitutional seizure of power, described as an hereditary dictatorship, has called into question any hope of normalising relations with the country that we might have had at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has responded firmly by condemning what must be considered a <span class="italic">coup</span> <span class="italic">d'état</span> and by calling for a return to the constitutional order and respect for the principles of the rule of law. Mr Louis Michel has voiced a very firm position on behalf of the Commission. Everything we are doing and saying is therefore in support of the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, which have been exemplary in their handling of the Togo crisis. The actions of the international community have already begun to have an effect, since on 18 February Mr Gnassingbé agreed to hold presidential elections within the time laid down by the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also condemn the breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the days following the takeover. Demonstrations were banned and many radio and television stations were closed. The first demonstration was put down violently, pressure was put on journalists and arbitrary arrests were reported. It was because of international pressure that the Togolese Government started to backtrack. The right to demonstrate was restored on 18 February and some radio stations were able to resume broadcasting from 21 February.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as cooperation is concerned, Mr President, and in particular the ninth EDF, the Commission is therefore sticking to the conclusions of the consultations contained in the Council decision of 15 November 2004. There will be no new cooperation measures until free and transparent elections have been held, and obviously that now also means presidential elections, which are part of the process of returning to the rule of law. There will therefore be no resumption of EU aid outside that framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council decision of 15 November last also provided for a partial resumption of cooperation. All the projects concerned are <span class="italic">de</span> <span class="italic">facto</span> suspended until the situation is clarified. So far as the money remaining from previous project-funding EDFs is concerned, the Commission intends to organise support for the presidential and legislative elections should the government express a desire to hold them soundly and transparently and if the time available allows.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the proposal for targeted sanctions, in its statement of 20 February the European Union indicated that it reserves the right to take measures to support the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States. In general, the Commission supports Parliament’s draft resolution, which is in line with the proposal and position adopted by the European Union and backed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore very pleased about the Council’s statements and the European Parliament’s response today through this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as we showed our solidarity with the protagonists of the ‘orange’ revolution in Ukraine a few weeks ago, we must today give our support to the Togolese demonstrators who are refusing to accept this <span class="italic">coup</span> <span class="italic">d'état</span> and are being harshly repressed for doing so. There have already been several deaths in the demonstrations taking place in Lomé. It is all absolutely unbearable and intolerable. Europe must bring all its weight to bear in rejecting this hereditary dictatorship, which is backed by certain Mafia financial networks, calling first of all for the resignation of Fauré Gnassingbé and then for the drawing up of a new constitution. That is the only way to guarantee the holding of free and transparent elections, to ensure the return to democracy of a country that has been bled dry and reduced to poverty by General Eyadéma’s dictatorship and to enable the European Union to resume its cooperation with Togo, which has been suspended since 1993 and which the Togolese people greatly need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
