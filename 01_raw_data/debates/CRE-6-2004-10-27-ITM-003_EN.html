<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, on 5 November the first European Council under this Netherlands presidency will be held. The last European Council under a Netherlands presidency took place in Amsterdam in June 1997 and resulted, as you know, in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no such grand ambitions this time around. However, it will not surprise you that the major topics of the forthcoming European Council coincide with some of the main items discussed seven years ago. In 1997, as a consequence of the procedures for approval of the Maastricht Treaty – which had caused problems in some Member States – the issue of how the Union could be brought closer to the citizens was added as an agenda item. That issue has lost none of its immediacy. At the forthcoming summit we shall also be discussing citizens' involvement in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important topics for the European Council are: first, a new multiannual programme for justice and home affairs; second, preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the Luxembourg presidency next year; and, third, external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs. This is a highly important topic for this European Council. On the basis of the Tampere European Council programme, much work has been done over the last five years to create a European area of freedom, security and justice. The European Union has strengthened cooperation between the Member States' justice and police departments and developed policy in the area of asylum, migration and external borders, but the work is not complete. The problems facing the Union are very much cross-border in nature: terrorism, organised crime, and flows of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. In addition, the attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York and 11 March 2004 in Madrid have shown more than ever the extraordinary scale of the challenge of improving citizens' security. At the same time, the Union must ensure that citizens can continue to enjoy their fundamental freedoms and travel freely within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has therefore drawn up the programme for the next five years on the basis of the evaluation submitted by the Commission in June. This new multiannual programme – also called The Hague Programme – builds on the Tampere Programme. Over the last two days the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers have been discussing this project further in Luxembourg. The Council has reached broad agreement on the substance of the programme. The issue of qualified majority voting and codecision on asylum and immigration matters may, however, be the subject of further discussion in the General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of discussion was the common asylum system. It seems that a reasonable compromise has been reached on this issue. The intention is that the European Council should establish the multiannual programme. The Hague Programme is based on the Constitutional Treaty but does not anticipate it. The presidency's aim is that the multiannual programme should make maximum use of the possibilities offered by the current Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Other aspects of the new multiannual programme include combating illegal immigration, a strengthened partnership with third countries and a common visa policy, formulating basic principles for the integration of migrants, effective border surveillance, rapid information exchange between justice, police and security departments, combating terrorism and working towards a genuine European legal area. These are all essential components of a more secure Europe where the rule of law prevails and each person knows his freedom is a reality. The intention is that the European Council will ask the Commission to submit an action plan in 2005 with the measures to be adopted and related deadlines for the implementation of this multiannual programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The second topic is the preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. As you are aware, during the Luxembourg presidency essential issues concerning the Lisbon strategy will be up for discussion. The Spring Council in March 2005 will have to address the mid-term evaluation of the Lisbon strategy. The Netherlands presidency wishes to make its contribution to the success of this important Spring Council. On 4 November the European Council will take note of the report by Wim Kok's working party. The European Council can subsequently ask the Commission and the Council to use the Kok report as a starting point for their preparation of the Spring Council.</p>
<p class="contents">At a dinner for Heads of State and Government, an informal discussion will be held on public support for reform of the Member States' economies under the title 'Managing Change'. The discussion will be introduced by the German Chancellor, the Prime Minister of Finland and the Prime Minister of Slovakia. They will share their experiences in this area with the other members of the European Council. The new President of the Commission will then explain briefly his vision for the future of the Lisbon strategy. The role of the social partners in implementing the Lisbon strategy will also be on the agenda at this European Council. Prior to the European Council meeting, the tripartite social summit of employers and employees will take place at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my introduction, we will also focus on citizens' involvement in the European Union. Following the disappointing turnout at the last European parliamentary elections, the June European Council decided it was time to return to this matter. To prepare the discussion in the European Council, the presidency organised an informal meeting of the European Affairs Ministers on 5 October, exclusively devoted to increasing citizens' involvement in Europe. The meeting focused on the forthcoming ratification procedures in Member States, which entail referenda in at least ten countries. The outcome of that meeting will serve as the basis for discussion within the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The third topic of importance to the European Council is external relations. Four subjects will be discussed. First, the situation in Iraq: the European Council will examine a package of support measures for Iraq's interim government. This package will be presented formally during the working lunch with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi. The package will, I hope, contain a political statement of intent for establishing relations with the EU and also a series of specific measures supporting the Iraqi Interim Government. Here I am thinking of EU support for the elections early next year, activities relating to civilian crisis management – such as police training – and building up the skills of the judiciary. Not only will this demonstrate the unity of the European Union, so badly needed following the events of the last year and a half, but it will also allow us in the Union to contribute actively to a real improvement in the situation in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will also address the situation in the Middle East. We will look at how the EU can further contribute to the peace process in the short and medium term against the background of the political decision in Israel on plans to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. I cannot say at this stage what might emerge from this discussion. As far as I am concerned, the five key points formulated at the March European Council are still valid.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will also briefly discuss Iran. The international community, which includes the EU, must unanimously continue to put pressure on Iran to totally suspend all enrichment activities and improve its human rights situation. In this connection, the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on 25 November will be an important benchmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we will reflect on the situation in Sudan, especially in Darfur. We must bring pressure to bear on all the parties to achieve progress in the various peace processes. Our starting point remains that if progress is insufficient, suitable measures – including sanctions – are definitely an option. The Council will also discuss positive action, including the support the EU can offer to the recently approved extension of the African Union's mission in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">That is an overview of the forthcoming European Council, for which preparations are currently in full swing. The presidency will brief you on the outcome of the summit at the November part–session.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and will say that, whatever happens today, offices are about to be handed over. The present Commission’s term of office is coming to an end, and that of a new Commission will begin. That does not mean, however, that a whole new policy is in the offing; on the contrary, whatever you decide, there will be continuity in the broad outlines of European policy. It is important to point out that there is no dispute about the great issues facing Europe today, and that European policy will still be reliable, stable and constant even after the offices have changed over.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with this in mind that Mr Barroso, whom you have already elected as President of the Commission, reaffirmed yesterday morning that the next Commission, every bit as much as the present one, was committed to creating a competitive Europe and to making the European economy more competitive. At the heart of these efforts was and is the Lisbon strategy, and it must remain so, with all its essential components intact. Change is, however, essential in one respect, and that is that we cannot be content with devising plans or ambitious perspectives, but we must also do some serious work on making these plans and ambitions reality, by which I mean really breathing life into this Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential aspect on which the President-designate laid stress is the creation of a secure Europe, one that concentrates on the needs of its citizens. The Europe we want is one that builds up its external relations with all its important partners, with prospective Member States in particular and with its neighbours in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The topics with which the European Council intends to deal next week are very closely connected to these issues. I want to highlight the most important items, with particular reference to the Lisbon strategy and to the new programme for strengthening justice, freedom and security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission very much welcomes the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, which is now entering its decisive phase; the high-level group chaired by the former Dutch prime minister, Mr Wim Kok, is to present its report next week. The Commission is working on the assumption that it, on the basis of this report, will be mandated to draft concrete proposals for this mid-term review in preparation for the Council’s Spring Summit. This is a time window; it is the moment at which we will be allowed to get the Lisbon strategy onto the right track. That should not be taken to mean that nothing has happened in the last five years, but there is no point in skirting around the fact that not enough has happened, and the Commission is seriously concerned to note that one Member State after another has, above all, failed to summon up sufficient energy to translate its promises into actions. This now has to change. The Commission is still willing to closely consider all the options as to how the process can actually be got moving and can also be better supervised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the EU must now really focus on the growth aspect. There is no doubt that Europe needs dynamic and sustainable growth in order to create more jobs and thus securely underpin our social model. For that to happen, we need more entrepreneurial initiative, greater willingness to be innovative, and more investment in research and education. Europe needs us to implement the reforms that make for more economic dynamism.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to become a real knowledge-based economic area capable of keeping up with ever-tougher international competition, Europe must play the trump cards it holds in the areas of education, expertise and technical development. Let me very plainly reiterate, though, that creating a more dynamic and more competitive Europe must go hand in hand with the maintenance of the European social model; only in a more dynamic and more competitive Europe will we be able to uphold that model. We should not forget that some of our Member States are still far from possessing really adequate social protection. Competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity must be advanced in parallel, they must, so to speak, move forward in step with each other. The Lisbon mid-term review gives us the chance to achieve these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to point out, in connection with this, that the Commission is not relaxing in its efforts to improve lawmaking, in other words, making it simpler and more comprehensible, and, in particular, to attach more importance to the broadest possible impact assessment, making visible what happens to the sectors of society affected by the laws we make, especially the economy and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has prioritised measures aimed at simplification and those intended to improve impact assessment and to measure administrative costs, and these measures the Commission unreservedly endorses. We are sharing in the work on these measures, and we welcome the work that is being done by the high-level group representing Parliament, the Commission and the Council on improving lawmaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the area of freedom, security and justice, the European Council will be adopting, by way of following up the Tampere programmes, a multiannual programme that will determine what the Union does in this area over the coming years. Since Tampere, we have laid the foundations for a common area of freedom, security and justice. The new Hague Programme will continue these efforts with the same vision and with a renewed willingness to cooperate with an enlarged and enlarging Union founded on the basic values of justice, freedom and security for all its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Tampere, we have adapted our priorities to take account of the many tragic events and appalling atrocities that we have had to witness in recent years. It is now largely accepted that the Member States cannot meet these challenges alone. If we are to prevail, we must continue to work together within the structure of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important element was the progressive development of a new policy, which deals with fundamental rights. The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitutional Treaty, the forthcoming accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, the development of mechanisms under Article 7, the adoption of the anti-discrimination directives – all these things have had an effect on the EU, and they are reflected in every area of its policies. In the same way that we, in the field of economic policy, make the claim to be seeking, by our own efforts, to become the world’s strongest economic area, we should also be ambitious enough to make every effort to become the area of the world with the strongest guarantees of human rights. These aspects remind us that we have to find the right way between the need for, and right to, freedom on the one hand and security considerations on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Where security is concerned, the events of recent years have compelled us to make the combating of terrorism a priority. Although we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from this, we should not forget the need to press on with the effective prevention and combating of all serious forms of organised crime, and this features in the new programme. In terms of practical implementation, the Commission welcomes the Council’s decision to introduce the codecision procedure for the sectors covered by Title IV of the Treaty of Nice, and will be producing an annual progress report on the results and the way in which this works in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week’s European Council will also consider the question of how to communicate Europe to its citizens. Here in the House, I do not need to enlarge on this task, for it is one with which every one of you has to do on a daily basis, and I am sure that we all agree that communication can be improved and needs to be one of our principal priorities. There is a perceptible gulf between the European institutions and the public, and we must close it. I believe that the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in all the Member States will provide a great opportunity for discussing Europe with the public and for involving them in its political processes. While the ratification process remains a matter for the national level, the Commission will, while it is going on, communicate more with people in order to be of assistance wherever they need to be informed about the Constitution or have its advantages for our Union explained to them. It does of course go without saying that a communications offensive of this kind can be mounted only in close cooperation and partnership with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying something further about enlargement. The European Council will not, over the coming weeks, be taking any decisions about the most recent reports by the Commission, but they will be discussed and presented. Your House has already received the proposals that the Commission adopted at the beginning of this month, and I think we have reached a very important point where enlargement is concerned. Even today, we can predict, with a fair degree of certainty, that the fifth enlargement will be completed, as planned, by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. We can fairly accurately predict that we will commence negotiations with Croatia at the beginning of next year, and we know that it will be at the end of this year that the great decision, with its far-reaching implications, must be taken as to whether or not to start negotiations with Turkey. Let me just say at this point that the Commission has endeavoured to produce a consensus-based proposal, one that has paid very close attention to the discussions that have gone on in the Member States and to what was discussed in this House – in every one of its political groups, no less. It was also intended that the proposal should take as much account as possible of people’s thoughts and ideas, not to mention their fears and concerns, which we do indeed share. The Commission is, for that reason, convinced that the proposals it has made constitute a sound basis for the decisions that have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that next week’s European Council will provide an outstanding opportunity to demonstrate both the continuity of European policy and its new-found dynamism.</p>

Almost everyone is familiar with the key words of that programme: growth, competitiveness, knowledge, economy, employment and sustainable development. Everyone talks about them, everyone supports them, but results are lacking or altogether far too insubstantial. Of course, the world has changed a great deal since Lisbon. Certain Asian countries are experiencing tremendous growth, and the EU itself has also become much larger. We have been joined by ten more countries, and that does not make things any easier. We have also learnt – indeed, it was spelt out to us in black and white in the spring – that, whereas the Member States are adopting Lisbon directives, they are showing far less enthusiasm for actually transposing them. We also note that the structural measures necessary in the Member States have not been taken, or have not been taken in all cases, or have not been taken in all cases to a sufficient degree. Should we dilute the Lisbon ambitions on grounds that they are not achievable? No, we need to do the opposite; a better approach is to go up a gear. I therefore wish the Dutch Presidency success in providing the initial impetus that steers the debate in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The obvious question, however, is how to achieve what we need to do. In our opinion, what we must not do on any account is to dilute the Stability and Growth Pact, nor must we on any account reduce our own room for manoeuvre to effectively do nothing in the debate on the financial perspective. What Europe must do, however, is to facilitate the evolution of Lisbon, and many things are needed and indeed possible in order to do this. I have always wondered whether the Member States can commit themselves to each other such that they are able to use that commitment as an external factor that can be called upon when they lack the courage at domestic level to do what they have to do, and when they are once again tempted to put off the necessary action for maybe just another year. It helped when we created Economic and Monetary Union, and it can help now.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we not also all make an effort to speak about the Lisbon process in different terms; to convey it to people in a different way? Even changing our vocabulary could help move the matter a great deal further forward. We have always talked of growth and competitiveness; we could also talk about prosperity for more people and greater opportunities for good jobs. We talk of the problem of population ageing; we could also talk about the prospect of a longer and better life. We must refine the message, but we must also provide a good messenger, and indeed this is something we have been lacking in recent years. I hope that we shall have a new Commission President who carries out that aspect of his duties, too, because we need him to. This could give processes such as Lisbon a boost. That is our task, and we must all do our share. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are planning to vote against the proposed Commission later on, bear in mind that this will be another factor causing considerable delay to the evolution of the Lisbon process, and people can really do without that. President-in-Office of the Council, I wish you every success.</p>

We are afraid that you are pushing Europe further and further into the conservative corner, and thus actually exchanging the Lisbon agenda for a right-wing agenda. This means harder work and longer hours for the same pay, instead of entering into global competition by maintaining protection, by means of more intelligent manufacturing, by investing more in people and in knowledge networks, and also creating scope for this in public funds; thus revealing social Europe. It is no wonder that Queen Beatrix said yesterday in this House that Europe has a regrettable lack of enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned that you are found wanting at critical junctures in the political drama set to reach its climax here this morning. Whilst Heads of State or Government such as Mr Verhofstadt of Belgium and Mr Persson of Sweden are adamant that they would not want the likes of Mr Buttiglione either in their own or the European administration, you refuse to give the President of the Barroso Commission a signal to indicate that he must back down and meet the manifest wish of a majority in the European Parliament. What is more, the Dutch minister Mr Bot even says that he is squarely behind Mr Buttiglione. You are very free with your opinions on tax reductions and economising; yet lacking as a Presidency when it comes to the utterances of the Commissioner-Designate who constitutes a threat to European values: the values that you yourselves advocate so fervently.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when citizens seem to be seized with political passion, the Dutch Presidency is found wanting; yesterday morning it was even physically missing. However good the Dutch Presidency’s technical ability, it is politically divided and is thus becoming a sickly figure. Europe deserves something better, more socially focused, stronger and above all more democratic. We challenge you, the Dutch Presidency, to develop your profile and political face. European citizens are entitled to this, beginning with a clear statement from the Council asking that Mr Barroso meet the demands of the European Parliament; or is your talk of a strong European Parliament really just for show? The choice is yours.</p>

The delivery of his speech at 33 r.p.m. was quite exquisite.</p>
<p class="contents">This Council will work through the findings of the Kok Report on reviving the Lisbon Agenda. Advance sightings of that report suggest a surprisingly coherent piece of work. My Group welcomes the prospect of a leaner, more focused redirection of the Lisbon Agenda. I notice, incidentally, that the Kok Report tempers our rhetoric a little: instead of 'the most competitive knowledge–based economy in the world', it talks of 'among the best in the world'. I do not take this as a lessening of ambition. The focus for the Lisbon Agenda should not be international benchmarking. The goal is delivering sustainable prosperity and a better quality of life for Europe's citizens in a way that reflects the innate potential and unique dynamic of European life, not crossing some notional finish line ahead of China or the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kok Report rightly stresses the need for European Member States to coordinate better. We cannot run a single market without a single mindset. How many European states are setting their national economic agendas with Lisbon in mind? Not many. Not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters this weekend is that the Kok Report does not become a substitute for concerted action by the Council. Welcome it; approve it; restate your commitment to it, but for the good of the European Union, make it real.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will also address the multiannual agenda for justice and home affairs, the 'Tampere-Plus', of which Mr Verheugen spoke. The ambition is to restate the broad scope of justice and home affairs policy in the European Union. Liberals and Democrats welcome that, but Europe has changed since Tampere and this new agenda must reflect that. Europe has never had a greater need of a balanced, liberal approach to migration and asylum. The evident desire in some national capitals to outsource our international legal duties to refugees and asylum seekers to clapboard states outside our borders must be resisted.</p>
<p class="contents">'Tampere-Plus' also means 'after-Madrid'. The fight against terrorism and the urgent need for better judicial and police cooperation must be priorities. Liberals and Democrats will be particularly vigilant in ensuring that measures to make us safer in Europe do not erode our fundamental freedoms. The Union will soon have new legislation on procedural safeguards and the rights of defendants, and we remind the Council that those rights are non-negotiable. We also want a commitment to a new third-pillar data protection instrument to guarantee Europe-wide data protection for Europe's citizens. These rights must form the centrepiece of the new agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday I referred to the Council as the invisible elephant. Now the elephant is here, and I hope that it will listen to what this House says today, reflect on our rights and the way we choose to exercise them and respect the prerogatives of this Chamber, whatever happens during the vote today.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the group</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to ask the President-in-Office two questions. One is about yesterday’s sitting: I should like to know what the President-in-Office had to do that was so urgent that he could not join us. I think his presence would have been important and most welcome in the kind of debate we had yesterday. My second question is about the Lisbon strategy: before I go into it in detail, I should like to know how the Presidency is thinking of organising the relationships between the three high-level reports that have recently been produced: the Strauss-Kahn report, the Sapir report and the latest Kok report. Most of what is said in these three reports is rather similar, but then it is not clear what the relationship between them is or, above all, how they will be followed up. I should be grateful if the President-in-Office could tell us something about these two points.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the content of the Kok report and how we might carry the Lisbon strategy forward, I should like to offer three considerations. First, when the European social model is mentioned, at least in these reports within the context of the discussion on the Lisbon strategy, there is a tendency to focus exclusively on the living standards and income levels that have to be guaranteed. We believe, however, that that is an extremely limited view of the European social model, which also involves the issue of how people live and hence the models of social cohesion that exist in Europe, how people consume and hence also the respect they have for our environment, and how people produce, thus trying to apply criteria of transparency and participation in a positive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we think it is a real mistake, especially for a group of top experts, to consider that just labour market reforms and the need to cut down rules and constraints are the only real ways for us to become truly competitive. We believe that there has been a complete lack of any serious thought about the macroeconomic reforms that are needed and, for instance, about how to overcome the weaknesses on the demand side.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in this as in other reports, the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the Lisbon strategy really seems to be merely a kind of token gesture: no one believes in it very much but there is a feeling that it has at least to be mentioned for the sake of conformism and political correctness. It is pushed into the background and left out of the real notion of growth. I should like to know what the Presidency intends to do on this subject as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the sphere of justice and home affairs, we have two concerns on topics you will be discussing. On the one hand, while it is true that the G5 substantially ruled out the idea of camps outside the European Union, it is also true that the report you are going to consider does mention dealing with asylum applications outside the European Union, in cooperation with third countries. We do not, of course, oppose such cooperation – we just have to see how it works in practice. The report also mentions increasing the asylum capacity of third countries, something that I find particularly heartless when talking about developing countries. I should be grateful if you could tell us why this general opposition to the camps is then somehow picked up again in the report and how the Presidency intends to approach this issue. The second difficulty is clearly that of codecision, the infamous ‘bridge’, to which there is considerable opposition. What is the Dutch Presidency’s strategy?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, a question about the issue of enlargement or, rather, about this period straddling enlargement and the accession of the new Member States. I should like to know whether the Presidency intends to do anything about the Turkish Cypriot question. As you know, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community has lost his majority. I should be grateful to hear what you intend to do, because the European Union clearly cannot abandon the Turkish Cypriots as it is doing at the moment.</p>

If the new European Commission is voted down under the Dutch Presidency, that will go down in history as the moment when European democracy took a step forward. The new composition of the Commission that is to be decided later on will not change politically, but it is in everyone’s interests to remove the most controversial candidates. This applies equally to candidates with a history of putting their own business interests first and to candidates wanting to maintain the second-class status of women and homosexuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Some important news is that the media have reported that Mr Prodi and Mr Kok are finally acknowledging that the most important objective of the Lisbon agenda of 2000 cannot be achieved. The measures chosen, aimed at giving large multinational enterprises greater scope and freedom, will not produce the most competitive economy. Establishing that Lisbon is failing presents Europe with new opportunities. It is time for a new objective: Europe as the most socially focused economy in the world. That was the original aim in 2000. We then made the mistake of confusing the long-standing pursuit of a social Europe with the quest for as many jobs in the commercial sector as possible. That mistake has now led to the proposal for a Services Directive that allows national legislation and collective labour agreements to compete with each other, to more extensive privatisation, leading to lower quality at higher costs, and again to a Ports Directive that would further destroy the work of the dockers.</p>
<p class="contents">We come from the richest part of the world. Our problems are the disintegration of society and environmental pollution; problems that will not be solved by ever increasing economic growth at any price. It is not growth but a better distribution of what we already have that must receive much more attention. Instead of maintaining a constrictive Stability and Growth Pact that seriously undermines the role of the democratically elected government as a problem-solver, we can strive for better public services, social security for all and the fair distribution of the available work. We have the means to actively combat poverty, indifference, crime, damage to nature and environmental degradation. It is there that the new challenge lies following the failure of Lisbon.</p>

Everyone agrees that this strategy has been and remains unsatisfactory and even inappropriate. Mr Verheugen was one of several speakers to say so today. Both within EU Member States and beyond the EU, the only viewpoint put forward is that of a single centralist approach to the building of Europe’s common future. Many of the Members of this House are actually sceptical about this model of integration, which after all is only one of many possible models. For example, a significant number of Members are opposed to Turkey being accepted into the EU, and the arguments they put forward are rational ones. As we search for a way in which the EU can communicate more effectively with its citizens, I would emphasise the importance of not disregarding attitudes and ideas which are as yet held by a minority, but which are becoming increasingly widespread and are equally valid. This is the only way in which democracy and pluralism will gain respect in this House, in the EU Member States and in the candidate countries. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House has heard a great deal about the Lisbon strategy, and we would of course like it to succeed. For this to happen, however, we cannot treat it like some kind of magic formula that will solve all our problems by itself. Mr Verheugen has said Europe must be competitive, and we agree that it must be competitive in relation to other regions of the world. At the same time, however, it has been said that we need to build a European social model, which I take to mean an over-supportive welfare state, or a state that robs citizens of initiative by providing them with everything the state believes they need. Clearly, a choice has to be made. Either we opt for a social model and an over-supportive welfare state, or for competitiveness in relation to America. If no such choice is made, we will not be in a position to build Europe’s economic success.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, Mr Nicolaï’s announcement that consultations will be held with employers, employees and trade unions are a step too far. It is quite sufficient for employers and employees to take part. If it turns out that trade unions need to take part as well as employees, I do not believe agreement will ever be reached. As regards the common legal area, we need to be aware that this must not extend beyond the legal framework laid down in the European Treaties that have been signed to date. If it were to do so, it would amount to a violation of the Treaties and thus to an attack on the EU’s cohesion. It should also be emphasised that foreign policy needs to be based on aspects common to us all, or in other words on positive values. Policy is extremely important in this field, for example in the case of Darfur. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It might be better to have fewer plans, but for those plans to be more realistic. What is genuinely disturbing, however, is Mr Schröder’s proposal to harmonise the corporate tax base in the EU. This project, details of which were revealed in an article in yesterday’s edition of the German business daily <span class="italic">Handelsblatt</span>, is supposed to be completed in 2006, and will result in tax bands being implemented in the EU, following the example of the VAT system. Does this really have anything to do with competitiveness, one of the European Union’s watchwords? It certainly does not. Instead, it fits in with the latest proposals put forward by the French Finance Minister, Mr Sarkozy, the implementation of which would be a particular blow to the economies of the new Member States. We will not agree to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, he has identified three very important issues on behalf of the Council; the first being the Lisbon agenda. I agree with all of those who say it is time that all the fine words are translated into real action. It is time that our European economy really establishes a lead. In my opinion, it is a good thing that there has actually been a certain change of model. I am not referring to those grand plans some people have for a ‘Super-Commissioner’ or something similar, and the change is not only from above, but more oriented towards the countries themselves: where can good examples be found; how can we support them? I am talking about a bottom-up approach, in which I should like to call for special attention to the regional dimension, to improving compatibility between a European policy and an effective national policy, including by promoting the most technologically advanced regions. We must lend support to these success factors, but one aspect of this is the need for better determination of whether national parliaments are really keeping their side of the bargain. Perhaps His Excellency could elaborate on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is terrorism. Many fine words have been said about this; but how is it possible, Mr President, that we were saying here so soon after the tragic attack in your native Spain that the security services really must now enhance their cooperation – indeed, that is what we had said on 11 September 2001 – that that energy now seems to be ebbing away again, and that it is again considered less important? How can we really ensure cooperation on combating terrorism now, before any more harm is done?</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is Tampere. This issue is crucial if we hope to uphold the credibility of a social Union. We will need to act boldly on this. It is no longer acceptable to have divergent policies that give people traffickers the opportunity to smuggle hundreds of thousands of people per annum like cattle across the internal borders of our Union. For this reason, I agree wholeheartedly with the Council about using qualified majority voting and codecision. We must stay firmly on this path, because it is time that Europe really solves the problem of these people. My message to those perhaps hoping to defeat the Commission this afternoon is therefore: bear in mind that there will be confusion amongst many people out there, because they cannot understand why the EU is shooting itself in the foot whilst there is so much to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like firstly to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for the extraordinary report on Turkey with which he has provided us. I believe it alludes to everything: arguments in favour of this accession and factors that only reinforce the fears we might have.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion we began to have in the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday evening has enabled us to distinguish two ‘clans’. The first is already beginning to draw up a formal list of everything Turkey should do before the accession negotiations are even entered into. As we are very aware, it is human rights that are at issue, as well as Cyprus and the situation of the Kurds. These are all matters that must be dealt with but that can be so over a very long period in the course of the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Others, like my own group, are, however, of the view that, at the geopolitical and geostrategic levels, Turkey constitutes an opportunity for Europe. We must examine the conditions of this accession very seriously. We must not already say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but begin to work in an entirely even-handed way, that is to say in the same way that we have worked with the other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, however, to express surprise, Mr Verheugen, that the report does not contain more scenarios or perspectives regarding the repercussions that Turkey’s accession might have for our social model. Shall we be able, for example, to continue with the current policy of social cohesion and with the Structural Funds, both of which are indispensable to European cohesion? Would not this social model be damaged by enlargements that did not take account of it?</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains only very vague ideas about the adjustments Europe would have to make following a future accession, and these seem to me to be quite inadequate. The issue of Turkey’s accession is, above all, the issue of Europe. Shall we be able to enlarge while maintaining our model of solidarity? We shall be particularly vigilant in this regard, no less than we shall be regarding the issue of human rights in Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The second thing we expect is that you do not go back on the protection of fundamental rights, whether this be in connection with exchanges of data, which must be subject to strict legal controls, or whether, above all, it be in connection with asylum and immigration, which cannot be subject to solutions that ignore human rights.</p>

<p class="contents">In Ireland, social spending cuts provide money to fuel economic growth. But, even when the profits flooded in, the Lisbon strategy, as our leaders chose to understand it, remained an excuse – a kind of mantra – to spend the new and plentiful money on anything but the people who needed it most. For example, enormous amounts of money have been put into university-level students but no money into early intervention for children experiencing learning difficulties, to give them hope of reaching college or getting a job and not having a life of dependency.</p>

The EU 2005 programme must be fully implemented so as to increase broadband access to schools and libraries and ensure that all our young people are guaranteed access to high-speed Internet services and development skills. Full broadband facilities must be available to all rural, as well as urban, areas and especially to the most peripheral areas of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must also implement the Financial Services Action Plan by the end of next year. This will ensure that bank and fund managers and insurers are able to operate on an EU-wide basis. A new framework directive on services – a key measure needed to complete the internal market – must also be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the EU must implement the recommendations of the European Employment Task Force. This Task Force seeks to promote greater flexibility in education, training and innovation, encourages greater flexibility on the part of workers and companies, and removes disincentives to employment. We must also invest more in research and development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We also look to the European Council to consider ways of raising awareness amongst European citizens about the work of the European Union and the relevance of the EU to our daily lives.

It is important to remember that the provisions and goals of the Lisbon strategy disregarded the EU’s enlargement and did not take full advantage of it as a catalyst for development. It is also likely that too many priorities were set. At present, we note a lack of progress with the implementation of the strategy. Key economic reforms have been neglected too, and this has resulted in a slow-down in growth. At the same time, certain governments are attempting to share their problems with others, for example by proposing tax harmonisation or initiatives to support European giants instead of the small and medium-sized enterprises that are far more important. The end result of all this can only be that we all lose this race.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the situation be rectified? First and foremost, the priorities of the Lisbon strategy should be reduced to an absolute minimum, and priorities relating to economic growth should be placed at the top of the agenda. Which priorities would this involve? Firstly, completion of the single market. This encompasses aspects such as the market for services and the discrepancy between governments’ declarations and their actions, as in the case of the quota limitations imposed on Polish service providers on the German market, and the fact that the situation has in fact deteriorated since 1 May 2004. Secondly, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, above all by simplifying legislation. Thirdly, modernisation of the labour market as employees must be mobile in order to win the fight to be competitive. We should therefore work on the assumption that as of 1 May 2006, two years after enlargement, there will be no restrictions on the movement of persons within the European Union. Fourthly, the Seventh EU Framework Programme should abolish the existing <span class="italic">de facto</span> preference given to research institutions from the old Member States over those from the new Member States. Fifthly, one of the instruments used to increase the EU’s competitiveness should be an effectively implemented cohesion policy, which takes into account the additional catalyst for development provided by the new Member States. In addition, the role of the European Commission should be stepped up to include the task of holding governments to account for the effectiveness of their actions. And last but not least, the European Parliament should not only be kept informed of decisions relating to the Lisbon strategy, but should also have an influence on such decisions, as this would facilitate the building of consensus at national level. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not interested in formal acknowledgements or ritual tributes, but I do wonder, Mr Verheugen, if this is the type of continuity to which you alluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, however, there are three good reasons to consider this third pillar of the Lisbon strategy to be still relevant. The first is that a few days ago an international event of the greatest importance occurred, something highly positive for once: the ratification by the Duma of the Kyoto Protocol, a field in which the European Union has been a world leader. The second is that, as chance would have it, the environment is precisely the field in which the Member States are furthest behind schedule in their implementation of Community policies. There is yet another even more important reason, which has to do with the subject that government offices throughout Europe are quite rightly – and rather obsessively – concerned about at the moment: competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the European Union regain its competitiveness in world markets if it does not commit itself to the new technologies, or if it does not take on leadership – including technological leadership – in the field of environmental technologies? This is the issue that I am raising, and I hope it will be a key point in the strategy review process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to speak on two matters: the first concerns Lisbon. The European social model can certainly be combined with competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity, which are not mere buzzwords but need to be transformed into political actions. To this end the results will have to be assessed in practical terms and our great ambitions must not be abandoned. The main road, I must insist, is the one that leads on firmly towards training, schools and research, to give everyone the means to grow and to take part in active citizenship, so that social protection does not turn into a benefits culture.</p>

The concern is that today, instead of what was promised, we have 20 million people unemployed and around 70 million people at risk of poverty. These figures are appalling. If it is true that the Lisbon Agenda has been one big failure, as President Prodi recently stated at the end of his term in office, it has failed solely in terms of the expectations it aroused and the promises it made in social areas, namely full employment and social inclusion, and in terms of knowledge and research. It has not failed in the areas that were of interest to the large economic and financial groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation and privatisation in essential sectors such as energy, postal services, telecommunications, essential public services and financial sectors continues apace, to the extent that more and more legislative proposals have appeared in areas that jeopardise fundamental human rights and workers’ rights, such as the proposal for a directive aimed at creating an internal services market – in other words, more privatisations – and the retrograde and unacceptable proposal for a directive on working hours. The Lisbon Agenda must, therefore, be reviewed, so that its content can be amended and so that jobs, and the social inclusion that is needed, can be given priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows just how inured we have become, perhaps partly because of the propaganda about the fairy tale of moderate Islam and partly because of the influence that the extremely powerful Islamic lobby, rich in petrodollars, exerts over European politics, the individual Member States and the media.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the important and sensitive problem of asylum, however, I believe we should encourage the perhaps belated efforts to relocate the examination of asylum-seekers’ files and situations to the territories of third countries, where it should come within the political and social remit of those countries – and I am thinking of the African countries here. Perhaps African leaders have clearer ideas on this subject, since they have told us of the trend to fraudulently use this technique – this trick – of falsely applying for asylum, and they have called on us to open our eyes. In order to involve the African countries, however, we need to change our aid policy and make it more transparent and more worthwhile for the peoples of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the European Union's most pressing issue. The health of the European economy is a matter of deep concern to millions of our citizens who remain without a job. It is of vital concern to future competitiveness that Europe will need to deal with the twin challenges of major demographic change and the competition that we are increasingly facing from China, India and other emerging economies.</p>
<p class="contents">In July when Prime Minister Balkenende addressed Parliament, he said that Europe's economy has 'stiff joints and makes little use of its head'. This makes our competitors too quick and too smart for us. Anyone who looks objectively at the developments sees that Europe is losing ground, even in periods of economic recovery. These were wise words and I applaud the priority which the presidency is giving to the economic sclerosis that affects significant areas of this continent. If we do not push radical economic reform, then Europe will fail. This does not apply only to our current generation: it will also leave a legacy of failure for those who come after us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi claimed earlier this week that the reason for the failure of the Lisbon process is the lack of majority voting in the European Union. What nonsense! The failure lies in the lack of political will to pursue the reforms that are plainly needed. Some people are trying to recast Lisbon to place more emphasis on the social and environmental goals at the expense of the hard economic decisions that are required. It is no surprise to me that the nations of Europe that are producing economic growth are those that have pushed the necessary reforms. No-one denies that these reforms were painful, but they were necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that Parliament, the Commission and the Kok Working Group all agree that real progress needs to be made. The question is whether Europe has the courage to move to action, rather than just continuing to express words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad about that because the early drafts I have seen of the Kok report would be an inappropriate conclusion for a mid-term review as the balance is wrong. I disagree with Mr Evans on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite correctly, the report makes much of the need for improved growth and competitiveness, but you have to read well into it before you come across the notion that social policy can be a productive factor. It is a productive factor. We need improved competitiveness to maintain our European social model, but that model is a productive factor in itself for achieving competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than talking in grand terms, let me give a specific example. I read recently that in the new Member States, as many as 40% of workers are affected by ill-health or injury related to work. The figure in the former 15 Member States is much lower, at 25%. I think that is in large part due to the comprehensive framework of health and safety laws we have had in place in Europe for over a decade. We need to bear that in mind. That is social policy as a productive factor, contributing to competitiveness, contributing to quality at work, quality jobs, and maintaining people's active involvement in the labour market. Let us maintain the Lisbon balance overall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Those of us who promoted and actively participated in Tampere I know that Tampere II has to be radically different. It cannot simply be a multi-annual programme with the same characteristics as the previous one. It must be able to choose, select, specify, emphasise and, above all, prioritise. These are not the only verbs one could use to describe what Tampere II must achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">We must move on from the general fight against terrorism to a European political project able to deal with the fight against Islamist terrorism; from general plans to combat terrorism, we must move on to explaining what concrete measures our fight against a specific organisation requires. I would like to point out that our colleague Alain Lamassoure has just introduced a European pilot project for combating Islamist terrorism into this Parliament’s budget: I believe that that is the path the European Council must take.</p>
<p class="contents">The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, replacing the European Union’s President-in-Office, has stated that combating terrorism is our continent’s priority, since the attacks in Madrid, the Philippines and Asia show that this problem affects all of us. But it is not just a question of foreign policy: it must have consequences for internal policy. There can be no European foreign policy unless we first have a shared internal policy within the European Union; there can be no foreign policy in Europe unless we first create an area of freedom capable of dealing with the fight against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This objective can, moreover, only be achieved if the efforts made to develop this area are not confined to creating a Fortress Europe. The debate on asylum must be refocused upon Europe’s humanitarian duty. We must, indeed, preserve the right of asylum. All those in danger must be able to find refuge in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is still to obtain an acceptable level of European harmonisation. It turns out that the first phase has not led to the harmonisation we wanted. Harmonisation has mainly been from the bottom up. It is therefore vital that we as quickly as possible enable new legislative instruments to be adopted. We must have an overall approach to the management of migration flows and of borders. I welcome the Presidency’s proposal to make the transition, on 1 April 2005, to qualified majority voting and to codecision for the whole of the chapter on asylum, immigration and borders, and I call for those Member States which are not convinced to allow, as quickly as possible, this transition to codecision in all areas in accordance with Article 67 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">European cooperation against terrorism should also continue to be strengthened and, in particular, it should be made easier for the relevant national services and the services responsible for the fight against terrorism to exchange information. This must go hand in hand with a strengthening of the roles of Europol and Eurojust.

In 2000, at the Lisbon Summit, the EU once again set itself a challenge for a decade: to become the most dynamic and most competitive economy in the world. 2005 is almost upon us, already the midway point in the decade, and the balance sheet does not make very cheerful reading. Scant progress has been made and in a matter of days Mr Kok will present his interim evaluation report, which will be the main item on the agenda at the November European Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not yet able to comment on the conclusions of the interim report in this House, but I do wish to raise two points that I feel are extremely relevant. The first relates to the fact that when the intention of a strategy is to influence everything, it normally influences nothing. We must therefore set clear priorities within a clear strategy. There is no point in favouring the economic strand of the strategy to the detriment of the social or environmental strand, or vice-versa. What we must do is set out political priorities for all of the strands. These are difficult choices, but they cannot be put off any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that I wish to emphasise that the Lisbon Strategy cannot only be seen as a responsibility of the EU. Success will depend, to a large extent, on the Member States’ ability to put the structural reforms into practice, which means that they will have to play a leading role at world level. I still believe that the aims of the Lisbon Strategy are neither utopian nor impossible to achieve. Back in the 1980s, for example, who would have believed that more than 300 million Europeans would be using the single currency today? As Kohl once said, the visionaries end up being the realists.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to welcome the position taken by the President – or so I hope – of the next European Commission, in making the Lisbon Strategy a priority for his term in office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these specifically related to the reason for my absence. It is simple: it was my duty to escort the Queen of the Netherlands here and to be present for her speech. The main thing, however, is that you can be assured that we are following everything that is said here about the extremely important issue of Parliament’s decision on the new Commission particularly closely. The Presidency is keeping in close contact with all the parties concerned and is not missing a word: you can be assured of that. All the same, the Presidency is not involved in this important discussion between Parliament and the new Commission President. However involved we feel in this, fully fledged democracy determines that Parliament enters into discussion with the new Commission President. I should like to emphasise here that no one, including the Presidency, would deny you as a Parliament any right to take decisions at your own discretion. That, too, is compatible with the fully fledged democracy that is Europe. That right is yours and I take it for granted that you as a Parliament will presently take a prudent, considered decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I should then like to express my thanks for the words of encouragement that many of you have given to the Presidency and regarding the coming European Council, and for your endorsement in many cases of the issues and the way in which they are discussed. Of course, your opinions may subsequently differ on the subject matter, and that is just the way it should be. In fact, the only general criticism I have heard regarding the role of the Presidency has come from Dutch Member Mr van den Berg from the Socialists Group in the European Parliament, but other than that I feel encouraged, on the whole, in the path we are taking as a Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the coming European Council, many of you have called for attention to the Lisbon Strategy. I should therefore like to formally draw attention to the fact that, as you know, the Spring European Council is the crucial European Council – the one at which decisions on the whole Lisbon Strategy are to be taken – and that the activities of this November’s European Council should be seen as a preparation for this Spring European Council, to be led by the Luxemburg Presidency. Nevertheless, a great deal is at stake, and I very much agree with everyone – Mr Verheugen was the first to emphasise this – that it is extremely important to give a renewed impetus to this Lisbon Strategy, and therefore to the development of the most competitive possible knowledge-based economy in the world. I also very much agree with the many people, such as Mr Eurlings and Mr Jonathan Evans, who have called for action rather than words; for theory to be translated into tangible actions. I also very much agree with the many people who advocated looking to national governments and trying not to pass the buck to Brussels. Let us be aware, however, that the Lisbon agenda is primarily the responsibility of national governments and that they must put their money where their mouth is. Mrs Thyssen was one of the first to underline this, but Mr Watson, Mr Eurlings and others also emphasised that it is important to have the courage to implement structural reforms at national level. Indeed, this is the very topic for discussion at the informal dinner with the Heads of State or Government. The implementation of such badly needed reforms will involve an exchange of national experiences. Some have pointed out that the balance in the Lisbon Strategy, as presented here by the Presidency, and as planned for discussion in the European Council, is not correct, paying too little attention to the components other than economic growth itself, namely the social and environmental components. I can assure those who drew attention to this, such as Mr van den Berg and Mrs Frassoni, and others that we shall maintain that balance. Of course, the Council will have its say and will have to draw its own conclusions but, in Council, the Presidency will explicitly hold on to the three pillars that the Lisbon Strategy had and must continue to have.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not at all agree, therefore – this was another of Mr van den Berg’s more cutting remarks – that this is a conservative approach and scheme. On the contrary, I think that we should actually be progressive in the way we promote economic growth in conjunction with the two other pillars. Indeed, it is good that the former Labour Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr Kok, is chairing the task force for the mid-term review and is to present his report. I really do hope that the Council can use that as a good starting point for further discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you rightly and understandably mentioned the other important item that is on the agenda more with a view to decision making, in a sense, at the coming European Council: justice and home affairs. Many have rightly said in this regard that we must not lose energy following the horrific attack in Madrid. We must use this energy to really take steps towards the interchange of data and towards greater police and judicial cooperation. Mr Eurlings and Mr Bourlanges and many others rightly made this remark. That is exactly what we are doing. This process is under way, as you know, and I am decidedly positive about the steps that are now being taken. We shall be discussing these. We shall also be discussing them in December, because then we shall have the actual report by the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator at our disposal, and shall bring this up for discussion in the European Council. It has also been rightly pointed out that, in the face of the great need to produce closer cooperation and come up with more extreme possibilities and measures in the fight against terrorism, we must not lose sight of the essential fundamental human rights and freedoms. Mr Watson and others made this observation. This important issue will certainly come up for discussion in this way at this and the December European Councils. Some – Mrs Frassoni and Mr Catania – asked more specifically about the ideas on asylum and migration policy. Camps have been mentioned, although we do not call them that, but rather speak of reception capacities in the region. Cooperation is needed with the third countries from which the asylum seekers originate. The Presidency proposes tackling the problems at source by means of enhanced cooperation with third countries, and hopes that this approach can be confirmed and decided at the European Council. This means that we must show real commitment on our part, but can also expect something from these third countries as regards migration and asylum. Many, including Mr Eurlings and Mr Bourlanges and Mrs Rühle, have rightly and very importantly referred to the question of principle that is the desired transition to qualified majority voting and codecision in this whole field of asylum and migration. I perfectly understand the desire on the part of everyone that has talked about this to see the changeover in this field. I cannot deny that it is a difficult discussion. You know that the Presidency shares the views expressed by a number of you here, namely that we should indeed take that path as far as possible. At all events, the Presidency is making a supreme effort towards this, and so I hope that we can achieve a sufficiently positive decision in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you have drawn attention to a third item that also features on the agenda of the coming European Council, which concerns the problem of ‘communicating Europe’: that is to say, promoting greater involvement of citizens in Europe, in what you do here, in what the Council does, in what the Commission does, in what we do in Brussels. Various remarks have been made about this, but in all cases there was agreement that this subject requires a better, more vigorous approach, because we cannot carry on like this: distributing pamphlets and then keeping our fingers crossed that citizens finally understand the merit and importance of the work that we are all doing here. In that sense, I also agree with Mr Piotrowski, for example, who says that we should not just give one side of the story, but also include the aspects of criticism and scepticism. Indeed, let us not fear criticism, let us not fear debates in which negative judgments are expressed, nor let us fear clashes between various institutions such as Parliament and Commission as regards the maturity of the democracy and the encouragement of debate, because debate will ultimately be the most important means to enhance citizens’ involvement in Europe. When they see that important things are decided here on which opinions can differ and on which citizens also have an opinion, they will become involved in Europe, and then – and I also address this to Mr Battilocchio – Europe will be less remote than many people currently find it. In practical terms, Mrs Sbarbati, yes, it will cost money. Commission, Council, national governments will need to have something set aside in order to attend to this. If I may mention one thing: the Dutch Presidency has promoted the showing of a television broadcast on the eve of the December European Council that will confront people in a broadly accessible manner and hold them to account on subjects discussed there, and the Dutch Presidency is putting money into that, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention other topics that have been raised, such as enlargement, to which Mr Verheugen has already referred. No discussion of the substance of this is planned for this European Council, because this is scheduled for the December European Council. There will of course be a presentation, and we are all familiar with the important and very valuable Commission report on this. I wish to hereby add my voice to the compliments paid to the Commission, particularly Mr Verheugen, by Mrs De Keyser and others regarding the value of the report we now have before us. I also concur with the remarks that she and others made about Turkey, namely that we must focus on the various aspects, on the opportunities and positive sides. Nevertheless, I also think that it was a very wise observation of Mr Verheugen’s that even the concerns that exist are shared by us, and these are also being included, have been included, in the proposals the Commission has presented, which also mention the possible results.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, Mrs Frassoni put a specific question regarding the Turkish part of Cyprus and what the Council intends to do about it. This is not on the agenda of the European Council, but I can tell you, and tell her via you, that her remark that the European Union cannot leave the Turkish part of Cyprus out in the cold is the exact essence of the guiding principle the Presidency has been following since the negative outcome of the referendum. This is also why, as you know, we are working hard with others to make as much progress as possible with direct aid and direct trade during our Presidency. At all events, we aim to continue working in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that I have covered the key issues and responded to the issues that Parliament has raised. Mr President, I hope that I may be excused after this speech. On this occasion, too, we shall keep track of every word the Commission says; I do not believe that this has to be in person. If you will permit me to take my leave now, I shall gladly do so. Otherwise, I shall of course remain here at your request. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has two causes, the first being factors over which we have little control, such as external indicators, global economic influences, oil prices, and so on, whilst the second, over which we do indeed have some control, has to do with the fact that only very rarely was the Lisbon project recast as a national project at Member State level. As most of the Lisbon project is outside the Community framework and has to be implemented at national level, the Member States must now be induced to devise national plans for its implementation and make the Lisbon project a priority for their own national policies. If they do not do that, it will not work, and I agree entirely with Mr Watson, that the question of whether or not we will be as good as the Americans in 2010 is an interesting issue, but probably not the decisive one. What I do think of as realistically feasible by 2010 is reversing the trend, which means reducing the productivity, growth and employment gaps and creating in Europe the dynamism that will enable us to achieve our goal of being the economically strongest region of the world, but, as little more than a perceptible reversal of trends will be possible in time for 2010, we should take a more realistic view of things.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to spell out some home truths about the relationship between the Lisbon strategy, the environment, and the social framework. We do, of course, want environmental and social standards to be as high as possible; as a fundamental of European policy, this is beyond dispute. If, though, we want to have the highest possible environmental and social standards, we need the economy to be as competitive as possible, with competitive industries and competitive businesses. Competitiveness is not just about individuals being able to make the largest profits possible, but about making our national economies so strong that they can achieve the great social goals, such as high standards of environmental protection and social security. The fact is, though, that the set phrases used in Europe conceal fundamental differences in thinking. I noticed that in this debate, in which, for example, Members spoke about quite different concepts of the European social model, with one Member saying that workers in Europe were over-protected, and others saying that they enjoyed too few social rights. One said that reform must mean the dismantling of social rights; another that it must involve more social rights. Within Europe, there is absolutely no agreement as to what the term ‘social model’ actually means. If, over the coming years, I get the chance to do some work in this area of policy, I will not play along with this policy of suppression and concealment. I will make it clear that there are conflicts here, conflicts that must be called by their names; I will make it clear that decisions have to be taken in full awareness of where the conflicts actually lie, and that these empty phrases and code words, concealing as they do what are actually utterly different outlooks, do not help to solve our problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Please excuse my vehemence, but there are times when, in order to achieve a policy objective, one has to become accustomed to the truth, which is that there is no agreement as to how to go about organising the relationship between maximum environmental and social standards on the one hand and competitiveness on the other – but we will work at it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say something about two other issues that have been addressed. I am grateful to Mrs Frassoni for again raising the subject of Cyprus, which gives me the chance to tell your House something more about it. I do not wish to conceal from you how deeply disappointed I am that it proved impossible to keep the promise made to the Turkish Cypriots after the April referendum by this Parliament, this Council, this Commission and the international community as a whole. They were promised that they would not suffer on account of the rejection of the referendum in the Greek part of Cyprus. We promised them that we would lead them out of their economic isolation. The Council has not yet been able to adopt the Commission proposal to this effect, and I appeal urgently, not only to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, but also to a number of other Member States, to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the policies of the international community and of the European Union in relation to Cyprus are implemented. The adverse effects are already visible. We worked for years to get a democratic, pro-European government in Turkish Cyprus; that government has now collapsed, as Denktash and his people were able to argue that the Europeans had, as usual, made empty promises that they could not keep. The damage already done to the prospects for a resolution of the Cyprus issue is beyond calculation, and the Commission urges that its proposal be adopted before the end of this year and that the promise we all made to the Turkish Cypriots be actually kept.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, ladies and gentlemen, with an observation on the economic effects of the enlargement that has already taken place and of the plans we have for the future. Mr Buzek said something very important, and the Commission endorses his view that the membership of the ten countries has brought with it a very beneficial economic surge. Our analysis shows clearly that enlargement has brought favourable economic results, not only in the new Member States, but also in the old ones, that both sides are benefiting from our integration of what are growing regions. We can expect the same thing of the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria, which are in the offing. Speaking personally, for I can say this only for myself, I am firmly convinced that, if the process of political and economic reform continues in Turkey over the next ten years, the result will be an economic situation in that country which, were it to accede, would put us in the same win-win situation as we have already had with the enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. That answers the question as to whether such an accession would jeopardise our social model, and the answer to that question is an unequivocal ‘no’. These countries’ accessions will not imperil our social standards; quite the contrary, they will make Europe stronger, and they will help us to achieve our goals.</p>

<p class="contents">Tampere II speeds up procedures for restricting the granting of asylum, promotes camps for rounding up immigrants outside Europe, introduces biometric data and strengthens obscure, centralised services, EU information systems and mechanisms for legalising repression on the pretext of organised crime and terrorism, thereby shielding the dictatorship of European capital.</p>
<p class="contents">The new anti-grass roots measures contained in Mr Κok's report will also make their appearance at the summit; they will form the basis for promoting the anti-labour Lisbon strategy at a faster pace and decisions will be taken about the militarisation of the ΕU and its enhanced participation in the Iraq war alongside the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">The repressive measures, however, will not be able to stop the fight by the workers against this warmongering, anti-labour, autocratic policy and the promising march to claim satisfaction of their contemporary needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
