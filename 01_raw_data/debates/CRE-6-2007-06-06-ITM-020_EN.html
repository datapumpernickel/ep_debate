<p class="contents">If there exists a universal bond that brings all of us together, as European citizens, beyond our differences, it is indeed culture. Europe is today on the way to achieving its goal, as it has managed to play its role in facing up to globalisation in order to preserve its identities and cultural diversity. The European ‘cultural exception’ is, today, on the way to becoming universal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gibault made a commitment when she was elected to this Parliament, to intercede with the European authorities on behalf of all European artists. This report has given her the opportunity to do so, through my speech this evening and all the work that she has done. She wishes me, in this connection, to thank on her behalf all the shadow rapporteurs and all the many colleagues, who have worked alongside her and taken part in the final drafting of this text.</p>
<p class="contents">The choice of the theme of the situation of artists in Europe imposed itself upon her: it was something she felt very strongly about because of her profession and her occupation as an orchestral conductor. Like Albert Camus, she is convinced that we have to choose to put culture at the centre of our model of society, that we must make creative activity and free access to culture one of our European priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to generally accepted ideas, most of the difficulties encountered by artists are not solely of a cultural nature, but they are linked, often, with their mobility, with visa policy, with health, with social security, with problems of unemployment and pensions. Mrs Gibault considered practical measures to improve the daily life of artists and she proposes, in particular, the introduction of a specific visa which would make their mobility easier. She thought of a European professional register to combat illegal employment and, also, a European Social Security card with an electronic chip to make it easier to piece together artistic careers. Mrs Gibault proposed also the publication of a practical handbook for artists which would contain, in a parallel text, the welfare provisions relevant to them laid down by European institutions and their application in different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">She stressed the need to promote formal artistic education, since for all of us, that is an issue that poses a real European cultural challenge. Therefore, without the willingness of the European Union to put in place specific policy in relation to artistic education, it is easy to see that there will be no progress in gaining audiences and making access to culture more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Her report was, therefore, voted for unanimously on 7 May, in the Committee on Culture and Education. It is innovatory and represents real progress for artists, as it takes into account both their precarious situation and the need to retain flexibility in their activities and proposes solutions giving artists the prospect of more continuity in their future and, therefore, of greater peace of mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, some amendments will be put to the vote, in particular two amendments that Mrs Gibault feels strongly about, because they would give a new impetus to creative artistic activity and would stimulate risk-taking in the sector, which is very much in need of it today. As her report says, moreover, in order to make progress on these aspects, it is a matter of analysing above all the results of the relevant survey by the Commission, taking into account the advantages and the drawbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Community law, when looked at more closely, has not been as indifferent towards culture as one might imagine. Mrs Gibault has included in her report an idea already developed, in their time, by Victor Hugo and Alfred de Vigny, according to which artists, after their death, can continue to contribute to the support of their contemporaries. The international provisions to which the Union has subscribed authorise Member States to take the measures necessary to protect their cultural heritage,which is built up, among other things, by works that are free of copyright, that is, those that become out of copyright 70 years after the death of the author and 50 years after the first performance of a work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gibault looked into this idea. She proposes the view that it would be sufficient, in a spirit of cultural solidarity at European level, for Member States to examine, each one for what concerns it, a way of deducting a part of the revenue generated by the commercial exploitation of works and using it to fund artistic creation and improvement in the social circumstances of European artists. That would enable the emergence of new support to foster innovation and pluralism and to encourage new forms of cultural expression. That is a very fine vision of intergenerational solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to quote these words, which Victor Hugo, once again, spoke at a public meeting before French Members of Parliament: ‘We are all one family, the dead belong to the living, the living must be protected by the dead’. What finer protection could you wish for? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, I think we realise how much culture is at the heart of the European project. We have programmes and projects at EU level that encourage artists’ mobility in Europe and thus strengthen intercultural dialogue in the European Union. For example, in 2006, which was the European Year of Workers’ Mobility, we co-financed three projects focusing on artists’ mobility out of a total of 41 projects funded over the year. These projects led to better acknowledgement at EU level of the various obstacles to artists’ mobility. It is a first step, and I know that if we are to improve the situation of artists in Europe, many challenges still lie ahead of us concerning lifelong learning, work permits and social status.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, I proposed a communication on culture with the title ‘A European agenda for culture in a globalising world’, which was adopted by the Commission. I presented this communication to the Committee on Culture and Education and to Ministers at the last Council meeting. The objective is to involve all stakeholders – Member States, European institutions and the cultural world – in a shared agenda of priorities for the years ahead. Improving the status of artists, which is linked to improved mobility and the circulation of works of art in the European Union, is one of the strategy’s key challenges. It is a prerequisite if we want to succeed in having a European cultural space. Therefore I am looking forward to working closely with you on this issue, and especially with the Member States, because responsibility in this regard is primarily at national, regional and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning back to the report, I particularly welcome the emphasis on lifelong learning and retraining. Initial education nurtures the first spark of an artistic vocation, but continuing to retrain is the key to ensuring artists’ social situation in a rapidly evolving economy of the arts. As you know, strengthening the links between education and culture is also one of my objectives because I propose to designate 2009 ‘European Year of Creativity and Innovation’. Work is under way to prepare a Eurydice survey of cultural and artistic education at compulsory school level in Europe. This is one step towards improving our knowledge base and I hope that the Year will stimulate research and the development of a stronger and wider evidence base and evidence-based policy and practice in relation to education in the arts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that the issue of the status of artists in Europe is a very broad topic, which cannot be dealt with in isolation by only one Commissioner responsible for culture. Therefore, within the framework of the communication we proposed last month, I will work closely with my colleagues responsible for employment, justice and the internal market in order to ensure that the specificities of the cultural sector are duly taken into account in other EU programmes and policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner, Mr Frattini, has recently announced his draft directive concerning the European green card to attract highly qualified foreign workers and allow them to live for five years in the Union and to move about in it without a visa.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November, we learned by means of a survey ordered by the Commission, that there is, on European Union territory, a professional category of about 5.8 million European citizens, representing 3.1% of the working population and with a turnover of EUR 654 billion; these professionals work quite legally and are, nonetheless, treated as illegals in many Member States: I am talking about artists and professional performers.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us enjoy going to a concert, to the theatre or to the circus but, as our leisure time finishes, the artists’ work continues, for some applause, often a meagre wage and almost always difficulties with the tax and social security offices. I congratulate our rapporteur, therefore, for getting to the bottom of what goes on backstage. Having said that, this is not our first attempt because, in 1992, Doris Pack already drew up a very full report, as did Mrs Vaz da Silva in 1999. And what about the initiatives of cultural organisations to encourage mobility and recognition of the status of artists? This report is not an outcome but a beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, just when we have approved the Unesco Convention and the Commission has just submitted to us its strategic agenda for culture, it is time to act. Commissioner, I urge Member States and the Commission to tune up their violins and without further ado attack the countless technical and practical problems. In this, you are not alone, Commissioner, we know that, but the initiatives suggested in this report must be implemented as well as the two others that I have just mentioned. That is enough of fine words, let us have some action! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He congratulated me on the Gibault report and told me how satisfied he and his colleagues were with it. The congratulations should go to Mrs Gibault, who worked hard in a good spirit and with good intentions on this very important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us respect artists and recognise their important contribution to European culture. We should help them by improving their social status. It is crucial for them to have information on the various social arrangements in the different Member States, for instance, in terms of health insurance systems and unemployment and pension provisions. In fact, some of the new Member States provided rather good social conditions for artists during the so-called <span class="italic">ancien régime</span>, but that changed during the transition period. Time spent by artists on rehearsals should be considered effective working time.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of artists, and employees in general, from the new Member States is still not ensured. Visa facilitation for third-country performers is important, but we must give priority to the free movement of all citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the report. My fellow Socialists and I will vote for it. However, as a Member from a new Member State, I have to call for free access to the labour market for every European citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be mentioned that some leading Hungarian artists refuse to travel to the United States owing to the degrading treatment inflicted by the American border authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the benefit of her experience in the sector, as an orchestral conductor, she has been able to identify the main obstacles that artists face in their careers. I fully agree with her when she says that no artists are ever at any moment in their career totally immune from job insecurity, and it is precisely because of that that more targeted measures are needed to protect artists and operators in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific nature of artistic activities requires that the Member States’ legislative framework should be amended so as to guarantee the status of artists, but harmonised EU measures are also needed, above all to facilitate their mobility. It is also vital to establish the basis for a homogeneous training system to ensure that the qualifications granted are recognised throughout the European Union, to secure an increasingly high level of professionalism in the teaching of the arts, and to encourage this through exchanges and networking for teachers and students on the model of the Erasmus programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a proposal that I find interesting and worthwhile is for a specific temporary visa for artists to facilitate the mobility of European and third-country professional artists when carrying out their activities. Besides, the universal languages of art are known to be an outstanding vehicle for the promotion of cultural, social and human values.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I shall be supporting the rapporteur’s two amendments when this Chamber votes tomorrow morning, particularly Amendment 20a, which aims at providing new kinds of aid for artists through a suitable fund set up with the proceeds of a levy on the commercial exploitation of copyright-free original works and their performance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should bear in mind too that changes in our civilisation are accompanied by the disappearance of many traditional occupations and skills. The latter are important for the preservation of the national cultural heritage. The planned European Charter for activity in the field of artistic creation should therefore also cover popular artists and craftspeople. In addition, we should welcome the plan to create a common database that would help to promote the mobility of artists working in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In her report, Mrs Gibault proposes a pilot scheme of registration cards for artists. Could this be the thin end of yet another wedge? Will this then be rolled out to apply to all professions and trades? Will we all then require a card before taking up employment? Could you then be prevented from taking employment in your chosen field, as is the case with photographers from other countries in Germany, unless you have a permit? And who will organise this, pray? More bureaucrats?</p>
<p class="contents">Just as over-regulation stifles business, so this proposal will suffocate art.

I should also like to congratulate Mrs Hennicot for her valuable guidance in the final decisions taken by our group on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the difficulties faced by artists are not of a cultural nature, but are connected with mobility, health, social insurance, unemployment and each artist's pension rights. The Commission must turn its attention to the current visa and work permit systems for artists and draft legislation in this area and in this sector. In addition, a study must be carried out, at European level, in the aim of analysing the provisions adopted by the Member States in order to safeguard compensation for holders of author's and related rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Artistic creation contributes to development and helps to maintain the cultural heritage; it helps to acquaint us with new trends in the arts and in the progress made in the states, especially between young artists. Society and the state, at both national and European level, must help to support creation by and the social and economic protection of artists because, as we know, art is not a commodity.

<p class="contents">I am not going to talk about these issues – previous speakers have already done so – but I would like to refer briefly to artistic studies. Firstly, we must stress their importance, and hence the need to pay attention to education in the arts from childhood.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point to the need for the Member States to recognise diplomas and certificates awarded by national arts conservatoires and schools, with a view to a gradual convergence and, if possible, also a convergence towards the Bologna objectives in 2010.</p>

The cultural, artistic and performing arts sector needs that, in order to ensure that the expectations of students of the arts are not dashed. This requires investment in the cultural fabric, in infrastructures, in promoting arts training and cultural activities.</p>

Yet we rarely mention the fact that these artistic works were often created by impoverished artists, who received no proper payment during their lifetime and who only enjoy posthumous fame. Even today there is no shortage of artists who, owing to the complicated procedures involved in obtaining work permits or in calculating their years of work, find themselves on the margins of survival, even though their works are magnificent and highly regarded throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Since culture and art rank among those fields that do not only bring spiritual enrichment but also major commercial benefits and many jobs, it is utterly unbelievable and quite intolerable that today’s top artists also have to struggle with issues of survival and social insecurity. For instance an artist in Slovenia is also an artist in other parts of Europe, and it would be a great pity if administrative barriers were to confine him exclusively to his own country thereby depriving the citizens of other Member States of the opportunity to enjoy his work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of education and in the European labour market we place great emphasis on mobility, something that is particularly important for artists and the users of art, and which makes a significant contribution to intercultural dialogue and the mutual cohesion of nations and cultures in the European Union. It would therefore be right for Europe to take some important steps here and to harmonise legislation to the extent that it will become usable and more understandable for the layperson, or to introduce at least some appropriate instruments that will contribute to the greater mobility and social security of artists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One really has to ask how often Parliament must restate these same demands before anyone actually responds. I was pleased to hear just now that the Commissioner might indeed take a small step in the direction we proposed 15 years ago. Some things do take a long time!</p>
<p class="contents">This report says that a review of the social status of artists must be undertaken. The difficulties and obstacles in the sphere of visa policy that impair the mobility of artists must be clearly defined. I know that Parliament is currently working on the visa rules, and I hope that artists will also benefit from this new regime. That has long been our cherished wish, and I believe this improvement is now well under way. The social status of artists is about their social security and about unemployment and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in the 1992 report we were demanding a status for artists. Just imagine – 1992! Where was Slovakia then, Commissioner? Back then we were already trying to make suggestions regarding the fiscal treatment of works of art and to achieve harmonisation for the works of artists, particularly as regards value-added tax. We tried to create a fund. We tried to create an identity card for artists. All that back in 1992! All of these things are now being called for once again. I learned as a teacher that everything must be repeated so that the lesson sinks in. In the present case, however, everything has sunk in so deep that it no longer resurfaces. Allow us, therefore, to whisper a word in your ear, Commissioner, and not in your ear alone, for this is actually a matter for the Member States. That is why today, just as in the past, we are again calling on the Member States to look for ways in which they can provide special support.</p>
<p class="contents">My report in those days was much bolder than the one we venture to present today, because we are afraid that some provisions might not be implemented and because we have become far more cautious now. We must measure our democracies by how much we do for the arts, by how much scope we give them. Claire Gibault has identified ways in which the measures we ought to take can be implemented by the Commission and the Member States. I wish her the best of luck in pursuit of that goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Este, de fapt, un nou efort de a sensibiliza Comisia Europeană şi statele membre în legătură cu statutul artiştilor în Europa. Aş dori să insist asupra unor idei conturate în raport pe care le consider extrem de importante, dar şi realizabile. Sunt convins de necesitatea unui Euro-pass, un registru profesional european pentru artişti care să consemneze activitatea acestora. Documentul ar veni în sprijinul mobilităţii specifice acestei bresle. În ceea ce priveşte această mobilitate, trebuie să facem o distincţie netă între cea a artiştilor şi cea a lucrătorilor în general. De aceea, solicităm statelor membre să elimine orice restricţie privind accesul pe piaţa muncii pentru artiştii din noile state membre. Totodată este esenţială recunoaşterea reciprocă de către statele membre a diplomelor şi certificatelor eliberate de către instituţiile de învăţământ de profil. Aceasta ar facilita atât schimburile la nivelul studenţilor, cât şi la nivelul artiştilor profesionişti, precum şi posibilitatea de a fi angajaţi pe baza acestora. Nu putem accepta nici situaţia în care artiştii europeni care lucrează în afara Uniunii să nu-şi poată transfera drepturile de pensie şi securitate socială la revenirea în ţara de origine din motive pur birocratice şi, de aceea, solicităm o iniţiativă şi în acest sens.</p>
<p class="contents">Luând aceste măsuri am convingerea că, vom contribui direct de la nivel comunitar la dezvoltarea culturii europene fără a leza principiul subsidiarităţii care guvernează acest domeniu. Nu cred că există un mijloc mai bun de cunoaştere şi apropiere între cetăţenii europeni decât actul artistic, respectiv cultura ca atare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be even worse, however, if you had to say what you have just said in 15 years’ time: ‘I proposed an artists’ statute 30 years ago.’ With Mrs Gibault’s initiative, something is bound be done to improve the situation. I shall now start the speech I have prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, Mr President, all the citizens in the 27 Member States hope for something. If they are workers they hope to have a future and if they are elderly pensioners they hope to have a secure present. Among them there are also artists, who perform an activity that very often provides entertainment and enjoyment for so many other millions of citizens who watch them, listen to them, like them and enjoy their performances.</p>
<p class="contents">Our current goal, however, is for artists to be considered workers with the same rights as all workers; artists are human beings and workers and, as such, are entitled to working conditions worthy of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">How many artists are there who do not become famous, who humbly perform their artistic work every day and do not receive a fair reward or due respect, and will not have a fair pension? I am sure that this initiative will help to guarantee a future or a present for artists as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this report will help to boost not only dialogue, but also cooperation in Europe in favour of artists’ creativity and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I liked the approach of Mrs Pack, because she is very enthusiastic and usually those people are far ahead of the developments, but we need such an approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1992, 15 years ago, most people, especially the Member States, did not want to touch culture, because subsidiarity is a sensitive subject. Now people want to do more through culture, because other realities are there: the market, the euro. The problem is rather intangible. I do not say that we need harmonisation, but we need better conditions for cultures to flourish in order to build understanding, intercultural relations and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, last Monday’s communication was the first in 50 years where the Commission set a kind of political manifesto and proposed a common cultural agenda. We propose to organise a kind of annual forum, the Davos Forum, which will bring together Member States, stakeholders and the European institutions to discuss, move forward and provide answers to cultural issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning new programmes – Erasmus has been mentioned a few times – this year we will have three times as many opportunities to increase mobility or triple the intensity of Erasmus. However, we need compatibility of studies or recognition of diplomas, degrees and qualifications. I proposed last autumn – and this is also in Parliament’s and the Council’s ‘European qualifications framework’ – making our qualifications more readable, comparable and transferable. Please make your contributions in autumn or by the end of this year, under the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, there have been many calls for visas. Visa facilitation is already in place, and I hope the Member States – with the exception of Ireland, the UK and Denmark – will enforce such visa facilitation for students to improve mobility of students and others.</p>
<p class="contents">For workers, which means professionals, in September we want to bring forward proposals on two important directives. The first is a proposal for a horizontal framework directive on the basic rights of all labour migrants. This proposal will provide for the creation of a combined residence and work permit in order to reduce administrative red tape. The second is even more important in this respect, because of what many of you have said. It is a proposal for a directive on the admission of highly-skilled workers. This directive may, in certain cases, directly apply to third-country artists and grant them facilitated access to EU labour markets. We can go back 15 years or 5 years, but now is the time to move, and together we can do something. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Constitutional Treaty can play an important role not only in increasing the importance of the European Union in world politics, simplifying Community law and decision making, and increasing transparency and thereby its accessibility to citizens, but can also help create an enterprise-friendly business environment and complete the internal market. The creation of a Constitution is also a competitiveness issue. It is a response to both external and internal challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The treaty accepted in June 2005 contains the basic values of the Communities that have taken shape over the course of their development to date, as well as common and Community policies the safeguarding of which is in the interest of the whole project of integration and of each Member State and EU citizen. The Constitutional Treaty was signed by the head of state or head of government of each Member State, and in 18 of the Member States the ratification process has also taken place. Despite the unsuccessful referendums in France and the Netherlands, we must not postpone the potential for integration that underlies the creation of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts of the German Presidency to launch the preparatory work for a new proposed treaty are welcome, and the European Parliament wishes to play an active role in this process. The proposed treaty that is now to be worked out should contain as few changes as possible, and should continue to ensure the protection of the aforementioned Community values.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I consider it important for the modified treaty to be given a more thorough, longer term and objective information campaign in each Member State, funded partly from Community sources, in order to secure a higher level of popular acceptance. In this information campaign, a prominent role should be entrusted to the European Parliament and its deputies, who represent the interests of EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
