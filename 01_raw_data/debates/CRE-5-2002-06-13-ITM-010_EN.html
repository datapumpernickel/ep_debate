When one considers the constitution created by the nation's wise founder, Tunku Abdurahman, under which the various states are in a federation, with the nine sultans electing a common Head of State every five years, and diverse races and religions living together without violence and largely without conflict, one might say that Malaysia had what it takes to be a model state, and, in economic terms as well, decades in succession saw repeated and outstanding development, despite the setbacks in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, all the more dramatic a development that Mr Mahathir's regime is beginning to take on the characteristics of an autocracy. First he attempts to act against dissent in the name of politicised Islam. Then again, he misuses the fight against terrorism, and its Islamic variety in particular, to take further action against dissidents, albeit under another label. At one moment he tries to win worldwide acclaim as the representative of democracy; the next he is a brutal autocrat, withholding even the minimum rule of law. That is what is at stake with this Internal Security Act – that appropriate judicial review should have to take place; that proper evidence should have to be produced; that detention should be under proper conditions; and that the law should provide proper means of appealing against detention. Political detainees in Malaysia enjoy none of these things.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we have to make use of both the next EU-ASEAN summit and the next EU-ASIA summit to push energetically for a partner as important as Malaysia to respect human rights, return to its roots, renew the peaceful coexistence of the various religions and ethnic groups, and, at the end of the day, for the disappearance of the repressive measures that have been constantly stepped up in recent years, have resulted in a growing number of political prisoners, and are incompatible with Malaysia's status as one of the European Union's key partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Internal Security Act, the Emergency Public Order and Prevention of Crime Ordnance and the Dangerous Drugs Special Prevention Measures Act all allow for detention without trial.

However, the Commission takes seriously the concerns reflected in today's debate and in Malaysia, as in many other countries, the fight against terrorism has at times impacted negatively on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission does not yet have a permanent presence in Kuala Lumpur, together with the Member States present in Malaysia it follows the human rights situation in the country, including the application of the internal security act, through contacts with the Government, opposition parties, Malaysian civil society and the national human rights commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague David Byrne made clear in the debate on this subject last year, the Commission remains concerned about the use of the Internal Security Act (ISA) in particular for the suppression of legitimate political dissent. The Commission believes that the Malaysian authorities should either release political opponents detained under the ISA or provide them with access to justice in an open court of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to support EU <span class="italic">démarches</span> on human rights issues to the Government of Malaysia on all occasions.

Moreover, these are mainly former countries of the Soviet Union and surrounding areas. In Europe too, important steps are being taken towards the abolition of capital punishment, even in times of war. This has been rubberstamped by more than 36 European countries. In Asia too, there is a trend in this direction, on the part of both governments and human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, and despite the positive steps being taken in the Japanese parliament, the situation in Japan is still very distressing. The number of executions that take place every year is fewer than in many other countries. Between 1993 and 2000, 39 prisoners were executed. The attendant system, however, is very different from what one would expect from a civilised and leading industrial nation. The executions take place by hanging. It takes 15 to 20 minutes before the condemned person finally dies. There have also been cases where the lawyers were not even able to collect the bodies in due course, but only the cremated remains of the prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome with open arms the announcement of the Taiwanese Ministry of Justice that capital punishment will be abolished in Taiwan in 2004. Executions were still taking place in Taiwan until 1998. This has now stopped, and in January of this year, the Mandatory Death Penalty Act of 1944 was repealed. In South Korea too, we see very hopeful movements in the direction of abolishing capital punishment. This too is to be welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are talking about three countries in particular: South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, in which some measures have been taken which at least give us hope.</p>
<p class="contents">In Japan there has been a bill, and the Japanese Diet has created a league against the death penalty. In South Korea there has been a bill, which was signed by 155 of the 273 representatives. In Taiwan the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty has been reduced. I think that these three facts can lead us to believe that in these three countries, in the not too distant future, the death penalty could be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">We should think not only about the harsh conditions under which prisoners condemned to death live, but also that there are 70 prisoners in South Korea and more than 50 prisoners in Taiwan who are still awaiting the death penalty. In the European Union we have concluded that the death penalty is barbaric. We therefore support the proposal from the European Council that universal abolition of the death penalty should be achieved without too much delay, so that we can look to the future with greater hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The abolition of the death penalty also expresses that view of the equal, unique and inviolable dignity of mankind which has its deepest roots in the Judaeo-Christian ethic of our Western civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s opposition to the death penalty therefore has a conscious and deeply entrenched ethical and moral basis that provides the foundation for our civilisation’s view of human beings. Enlargement of the EU will also mean abolition of the death penalty’s being a principle that will be extended to new countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We Christian Democrats and liberal conservatives in the group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regret the fact that, in the present resolution, this unifying principle of the abolition of the death penalty, which we fully support, is only affirmed in relation to free and democratic states such as Japan and South Korea, where football’s World Cup is being organised right now, together with Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">For some reason, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, together with the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the left-wing socialists and former Communist parties here in the European Parliament have chosen not to say anything at all about the abolition of the death penalty in neighbouring countries such as China and North Korea. We find that extremely one-sided and difficult to understand and therefore choose to abstain from voting in the impending vote at 5.30 p.m.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight for the abolition of the death penalty, we must take our stance on a shared moral basis. Singling out free and democratic states gives a one-sided impression. That is deeply regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford, Glyn (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I have some sympathy with Mr Sacrédeus. I am opposed to the death penalty. It needs to be abolished throughout the world, save possibly in time of war. I myself in this House appealed to President Fontaine last year to write to the US federal authorities to protest against the death penalty for the right-wing terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Yet I confess I voted against placing this issue on the agenda. I am not convinced of its urgency in the light of the fact that in South Korea the government of Kim Dae-jung has not allowed any death sentences to be carried out since he took office in February 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">In Taiwan, as the resolution itself states, there has been a recent reform in the penal code abolishing the mandatory death penalty for various violent crimes, while the Minister of Justice has stated that this is the first step towards abolishing capital punishment within the next three years.</p>
<p class="contents">In Japan there has been a Diet Members' League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty since 1993. In one sense I am almost amused that the resolution welcomes its creation nine years on. It almost warrants an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as one of the most belated welcomes in history, and I confidently expect in the future to hear in one of our resolutions that Mafeking has been relieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty has 113 members from all parties in both Houses in Japan, representing almost one sixth of MPs. Last year, only two death sentences were carried out and the government has announced that it will promote a new law that will create the possibility for judges to substitute life without parole for the death penalty for capital crimes. Nevertheless, now that the matter is on the agenda, we will vote in favour of the resolution, of course, but maybe in future we can focus on those countries around the world where the carrying out of death sentences is virtually or actually a daily event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, in particular, to thank Mrs Frassoni, President of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, for having put this matter to the vote on Monday as an addition to the subjects for topical and urgent debate, and I should also like to thank Mrs Napoletano of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Mrs Malmström of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, as well as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – whatever the views of Mr Sacrédeus – and the Communist Group for having supported and upheld this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we had to salute this remarkable Council of Europe initiative, which is aimed not at all countries but at specific ones, namely the countries with observer status within the Council of Europe and, in particular, the United States and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">A delegation from the Council of Europe recently visited Japan to participate in a seminar organised by the Japanese Diet and, in spite of what Mr Ford says, the Parliamentary League, which has actually been in existence for nine years, had been somewhat in abeyance and has only resumed its work very recently.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I think that the issue of the death penalty in democratic countries is one thing, while the death penalty in non-democratic dictatorships is another. I freely admit that the vast majority of cases – the figure is 98% – involve dictatorships but, where dictatorships are concerned, I think that the priority is not perhaps the abolition of the death penalty but a return to democracy and the rule of law. The battle is quite different, as are the forces deployed, but I believe that this initiative, aimed at three democratic Asian countries, is important, and important for one essential reason.</p>
<p class="contents">When we meet the top leaders of the People’s Republic of China, we see them basically arguing in favour of a certain relativism in human rights whereby there is apparently a distinctively Asian approach to the issue. What, then, we have to state is that there is no such Asian approach to human rights. There is a universal approach to human rights and democracy and, that being said, enlisting countries as important as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in the ranks of the abolitionist countries is crucial to affirming this universal nature of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore obvious – and I hope, by saying this, to reassure Mr Sacrédeus – that we are not giving up the battle for the abolition of the death penalty in dictatorships. It is just that, in such countries, the problem is just one among so many others. What matters now is to affirm this idea of universality, and I think we also need to start thinking about transforming the Council of Europe. With the forthcoming enlargement, there is now an overlap between the European Union and the Council of Europe, and I think we need to think about transforming the Council of Europe into a Universal Council of Democracies into which we could integrate countries like Canada, the United States, Japan and South Korea and have them genuinely spearhead a campaign to affirm democracy throughout the world, beginning with the battles for the abolition of the death penalty and for the International Criminal Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU works towards the universal abolition of the death penalty, which is one of the pillars of its human rights policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the process of attaining this objective and in accordance with the EU guidelines on the abolition of the death penalty, where the death penalty still exists the EU calls for its use to be progressively restricted and insists that it be carried out according to minimum standards. The EU also presses, where relevant, for the introduction of moratoria.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU reaffirmed its commitment to the abolition of the death penalty by tabling a resolution at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva this year. Many activities which aim to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty have been supported under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding such projects has recently been reaffirmed as a priority in the Commission's communication, or policy paper of 8 May 2001 on the Union's role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes some of the recent positive steps taken by the three countries concerned, and, firstly, the frank exchange of views at a seminar in Tokyo in May 2002 on "Justice and Human Rights in Council of Europe Observer States: the Abolition of the Death Penalty" and the establishment of a Japanese Diet members' league for the abolition of the death penalty; secondly, the bill tabled to abolish the death penalty in the Republic of Korea which was supported by a majority of the National Assembly last year; thirdly, the amendment to the penal code of Taiwan which reduces the list of crimes for which the death penalty is mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">However, conscious that a great deal remains to be done to abolish the death penalty in the Asian region as a whole, the EU decided in 2001 to enhance its strategy for abolishing the death penalty in that part of the world on the basis of the 1998 guidelines on the death penalty. The forthcoming EU Annual Report on Human Rights for 2001/2002 will provide an overview of the action taken in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will continue its efforts to abolish the death penalty in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
