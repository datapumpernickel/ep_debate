<p class="contents">Their timing was a bit odd, considering that their move was made during the COREPER meeting. However, the Turkish proposal is nothing more than a clumsy, unacceptable and provocative manoeuvre, whose sole objective is to bypass the obligations undertaken by Ankara towards the European Union and its Member States. Not only is Ankara persisting on essentially denying its obligations, but also is arrogantly setting conditions aimed at gaining favours in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s obligations towards the European Union are very specific and are not subject to bargaining. Given these facts, the European Union should reject without further consideration these so called Turkish proposals.

Mr Seselj surrendered voluntarily in January 2003, four years ago, when the indictment against him was published. The indictment referred only to speeches and a political plan to bring all Serbs together in a single country; that may be questionable of course, but we know what very painful circumstances that country has been through. Mr Seselj has been held in solitary confinement since December 2004 for granting interviews to Serbian newspapers, but the prosecutor, Mrs Uertz-Retzlaff, speaks against him in the press freely.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Seselj is demanding to see his family; he should be entitled to do so and to appear freely. He is demanding to correspond with the Tribunal in Serbian, his native language, which he is also entitled to do, but is being denied that right. As a doctor and professor of law, he wishes to conduct his own defence, which is a fundamental right. He is refusing to accept lawyers appointed by the tribunal, whom experience has shown to favour the prosecution. What does Alphons Orie, the presiding judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have to say about this?

The dictator, who holds a Russian passport and was trained by the KGB, claimed 80% of the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The election was organised by an illegitimate government on territory controlled by foreign military forces; its result is null and void in terms of international law. The Smirnov regime will not be made any more legal by the permission given to three weak opponents to take part in a contest the result of which was known in advance, having been decided in Moscow during the summer. Smirnov’s only serious rival, Mr Shevchuk, the speaker of the Supreme Soviet of Transnistria, withdrew his candidacy at the urgent request of the Kremlin.</p>

Our border assistance mission has proved successful where Russia’s <span class="italic">de facto </span>veto has paralysed the OSCE’s effectiveness.

<p class="contents">Europe is not absent from that region. It is present: with its diplomatic action, its development and humanitarian aid, its corporate relations in the Mediterranean and its participation in peace-keeping forces. However, it did not manage to play an effective role and so we must look into it immediately, because our hopes that military interventions will create a new Middle East with democracy and stability are not coming true. Therefore, we must look into a new intervention plan; moreover I believe that the European Parliament can promote the relevant talks, demanding results, which will positively affect the prosperity of both the people living in the region and ourselves of course, because whatever is happening in our neighbourhood should concern us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The area he is interfering in is not his responsibility: he has responsibility for the internal market, not for competition. In addition to that, the policy being pursued by the Government has been approved by the Commission and has recently been approved by the Irish courts.</p>
<p class="contents">My only conclusion is that Commissioner McCreevy is assisting his former Cabinet colleague and friend, Minister Harney, in shifting her policy on health insurance and blaming Brussels for that shift in policy. That is an unacceptable direct interference by a Commissioner in Irish political decision-making. I would appeal to you, Mr President, to make those concerns known to President Barroso. I will pass on to you the correspondence I have had on that matter with the President and with Commissioner McCreevy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The difficulty is that a lot of the processing capacity in Ireland is not exactly on the shore or on the docks, but further inland. This creates difficulties in terms of transportation, since road transport counts as part of the 100-kilometre range.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Commissioner Borg to look very carefully at that issue and give us a more flexible interpretation of the rule: both to allow what is a very successful Irish fishing industry to continue, and because it has an impact not only on Irish catches but also on the ability of other boats operating in Irish waters to land their catches in Ireland. This means they have to travel further, use more fuel, and are being forced to land their catches in other markets, which may not necessarily benefit the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recently, however, ticket prices for flights between these islands and the Portuguese mainland rose dramatically, on account of the increase in the price of oil. This decision by the Portuguese Government is, in our view, a questionable one, as it runs counter to the spirit of the Council regulation governing this form of public service obligation, which is why I have brought the matter to Parliament’s attention. How come passengers on these flights are being made to pay for the increase in the price of fuel, thereby hampering their mobility, especially now that the price of oil is falling and the euro is becoming stronger? What is more, the Portuguese Government and the Community bodies know that passengers on Madeira and Porto Santo have no alternative sea link with the mainland.</p>
<p class="contents">This is ample reason for Parliament and the Commission to look into and monitor this measure, which penalises the citizens of one of the EU's outermost regions. We should like this matter to be clarified and the situation changed, which is why we have brought it to the Commissioner's attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Bush’s decision to launch this programme is, among other things, a result of long-term pressure exerted by the new Member States. Their leaders took every opportunity to remind President Bush of the fact that they would like to see the visa requirements simplified or cancelled altogether, thus, enabling their citizens to travel to the USA under the visa waiver programme, just like the nationals of western European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Slovakia, it should be pointed out that, as a result of reforms conducted by the government of Mikuláš Dzurinda, the country has made substantial economic progress. There are no longer such pressing economic reasons for Slovaks to violate their visa status and immigrate illegally to the USA. The facilitation of travel and the cancellation of visa requirements for citizens of the new Member States will have to be accompanied by, among other things, compliance with new, stricter, security requirements.

Our discussions have still not had any practical impact, however, and our dreams of high economic growth may never come true as there may be nobody around to help achieve the desired growth.</p>

<p class="contents">The Lisbon objectives must go hand in hand with an appropriate demographic policy for the Union. Such a policy could perhaps be modelled on the measures taken by Finland, France and Latvia. These countries are currently experiencing a baby boom, due to the provision of appropriate incentives and facilities for parents who wish to have children but also wish to be able to support them, and who have been enabled to combine their parental responsibilities with paid employment.</p>

Today, 11 December, marks 60 years from the foundation of Unicef and we are celebrating the International Children's Day. The Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child have been signed – even though some states have not yet signed – and the Commission has already presented its Strategy on the Rights of the Child on a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we hope for coordinated action throughout the European Union’s external and internal policies, and an effort from every Member State for the protection of the rights of the child, which from what we see is not only threatened by poverty, illiteracy and armed conflicts in countries outside the Union, but is equally in danger within our own civilised countries from malicious attacks by people who do not have collective responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to draw your attention today to the existence of illegal vine plantations in Europe, which are thought to cover an area of 150 000 hectares in the European Union as a whole. According to the Commission’s own figures in a March 2004 report, these illegal vine plantations are equivalent to an output of 5 to 8 million hectolitres at a time when European overproduction is put at 12 million hectolitres. The permanent grubbing-up of these illegal vines would allow a measure of balance to be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">Before any decision on grubbing-up is taken, I therefore call on the Commission to determine the precise scale of these illegal plantations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the issues you may not have been aware of during your visit is the deep unease in the countryside about how the Commission is applying on-farm inspections in relation to the common agricultural policy and cross-compliance. There is a huge gap between what the Commission says it is doing in relation to simplification initiatives and what is happening on the ground in relation to cross-compliance inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">The checklist with which farmers are required to comply is very long and confusing. Allied to that, there is real fear that if you breach one of these regulations, you will face a penalty on your payment. Consumers deserve to know that farmers meet high standards of food safety and production; but I would ask whether these unannounced spot-checks of the detailed sort I have outlined are the way to meet that objective. The Irish Government itself is to blame for the long delay in implementing the Nitrates Directive, with the result that we are now forced to have all the on-farm inspections catapulted into the latter end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I ask the Commission to specify exactly what it wants from farmers, and to ensure that all Member States are complying with the rules? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lately one hears many discontented voices saying that the quality of translations is declining. You are no doubt aware, Mr President, that we allot large sums of money for translations and we rightly take pride in the possibility of speaking various languages in European institutions. I think that one of the problems causing an increase in the amount of complaints about the quality of translations is the fact that in our Parliament the translation quality control system is not appropriately set up and does not function adequately. Indeed, the quality of translations is usually checked by colleagues, that is, they check each other’s work, which is probably not very objective. Queries from Members of Parliament are not often responded to by Translation Service staff. At least I have never received any replies. I hope that the Parliamentary Bureau will bring this to their attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
