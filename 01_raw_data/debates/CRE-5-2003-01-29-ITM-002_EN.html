<p class="contents">The international situation is not good and the time has come for us to hold a debate within this institution to consider how the most burning issues currently on the international scene can be viewed, and if possible resolved, from a European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen the placards that some Members of this Parliament have displayed very clearly, and I would like to say that unfortunately, or fortunately in other respects, I am talking to you from the point of view of an old Europe, because of my age, but also because of my affection for everything which is represented by the Europe of yesterday, the Europe of today and the Europe of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, do not imagine that I am so old, I am going to carry on working and pestering people for a few more years.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in the short time available to me this afternoon, if the honourable Members will allow me, I would like to discuss four or five points which I believe are essential to a global understanding of the international situation. The first is undoubtedly Iraq. But I would also like to take this opportunity to debate with you, if only very briefly, the situation in the Middle East on such an important day as this, the day after the elections in Israel. I also believe it would be a mistake not to say a few words about North Korea, given the dramatic situation at the moment, and I will end with a very brief comment on the operations the European Union is beginning to plan for the deployment of forces in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin with the first point: the situation in Iraq. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the General Affairs Council is taking place this week and next week and they are going to be extremely important weeks in terms of finding a solution to the Iraq crisis. On Monday morning, for the first time, there was a concertation procedure, in accordance with Article 19 of the EU Treaty, between the Presidency, the troika and the members of the European Union sitting on the United Nations Security Council here in Brussels at ministerial level. This is the first time that anything of this nature has taken place; there had been many concertation meetings in New York, but there had never been a meeting here in Brussels at ministerial level of the two permanent members and the two non-permanent members of the Security Council together with the Presidency, Commissioner Patten and myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say very briefly that in the meeting there was general consensus at least on four essential points which the European Union wishes to defend in all fora. I will run through the four points, although the honourable Members know them very well. Firstly: we all have an interest in Iraq getting rid of weapons of mass destruction and this is something that all Europeans should agree on. One of the most serious problems we are going to face during this century is unquestionably the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And we Europeans cannot ignore this problem, a serious problem for which a solution must be found. Therefore, to try, by every means possible, and in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, to ensure that Baghdad gets rid of all weapons of mass destruction must be a priority for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is Iraq’s responsibility to cooperate actively with the inspectors. You have good knowledge of the report which Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei presented the other day to the Security Council, and you saw them directly, because the President of the European Parliament had the opportunity to speak with the inspection chiefs by means of a videoconference with New York. I also had the opportunity to speak with them subsequently, and I will therefore not insist on this since I am sure that the Presidency has informed Parliament in a clear manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which I believe is essential to point out, is that we must give all the necessary support to the inspectors. The inspectors are the eyes and ears of the international community. If they are capable of convincing the Security Council of the situation, I am sure that the Security Council will also convince public opinion of the current situation in Baghdad. Therefore, whatever the implicit or explicit requests – and I insist, implicit or explicit – of the inspectors to the members of the Security Council, I believe Europe should help them. And there are essentially three types of suggestions or requests that the inspectors could make to us, firstly: that they require more resources, more resources than they currently have, more inspectors and more logistical resources; secondly: they may need more time; and thirdly: they may need more information or more intelligence. I believe that the international community should respond positively to these three requests from the inspectors. In other words, they should be offered resources, time and intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">And the fourth point, which I believe is absolutely essential and which must be defended by the Europeans, is that the whole of this process relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and more specifically the issue of Iraq, must remain within the framework of the United Nations Security Council. It must be carried out within the framework of the United Nations, which is the institution which must provide the legitimacy for any action in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, you are well aware of the differing positions expressed by various Members of the European Union, but you also know that there are not just the opinions of the leaders in the European Union, but we also have clear and convincing surveys of the thoughts of the European citizens. I believe that the European citizens are clear about two things: one, that they do not want war; and the other, that they do not want dictators in the world. And we must make the two things compatible in the eyes of the population, of the citizens of Europe. How to make preventing armed conflicts and preventing the existence of dictators compatible is the great challenge facing the international community. Our intention as Europeans must be to ensure that Resolution 1441, which was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council and which was approved unanimously by the Arab League two days later, should become a reality and that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime can disarm without the need for military force.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the countries of the European Union and all of us who serve the European Union will work with all our might, day and night, to try to prevent a conflict and to ensure that Saddam Hussein abandons weapons of mass destruction without our turning to military force.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, a debate began today in the Security Council on the basis of the report produced by the inspection chiefs 48 hours ago. Let us wait and see how that debate develops before taking a position on it.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, yesterday the President of the United States made an important speech. I would like to welcome an expression, a phrase, an idea, which was suggested in this speech, which is the idea, the suggestion or the commitment that the Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell, would appear before the United Nations Security Council to explain the information and intelligence in existence in those countries which have privileged information or privileged intelligence. I believe and I insist that the centre of gravity of this process must continue to be the United Nations Security Council and I therefore believe it very appropriate that the information that certain countries currently have should be debated within it and that, if possible, that information should also be passed on to the inspectors.</p>
<p class="contents">You also know that there will be other consultations in the coming days …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… and let us hope that the inspectors can have more time to continue their work and, if possible, as I said before, to complete their mandate in accordance with Resolution 1441.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is involved in this process: four Members of the European Union are on the Security Council, one candidate for membership of the European Union is on the Security Council and I am sure that the countries making up that Council will make every possible effort so that what we are saying here becomes reality in the coming days.</p>
<p class="contents">Since you have information from the President of Parliament on the conversation yesterday with Dr Blix, I will not say anything about the comments made and I will move on briefly to the second point I wanted to discuss with you, ladies and gentlemen, which is the issue of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday elections took place in Israel, and I believe we must learn at least three important lessons from these elections. Firstly, the low turn-out. It is surprising – or at least it surprises me – that in view of the situation we are facing in the Middle East electoral turn-out should be so low. It is the lowest turn-out since the 1967 elections. That is the first point to stress.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point to stress is the enormous, and very significant, victory of Prime Minister Sharon. I would like, on behalf of all of us, to congratulate him on his victory and the victory of his party. Sharon’s victory is like none other of his previous victories. And I believe we should say to Prime Minister Sharon, on behalf of the European Union, that at this time when he has enormous opportunities to form a coalition government, that he should form a coalition government that concentrates on resolving the problem of the war and finding permanent peace in the Middle East. That is the demand that with respect I believe we should make of him since it has been demonstrated that a huge number of Israelis have voted for him.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue we should highlight and on which we must draw conclusions is the heavy defeat of the Labour Party and the defeat of the Meretz Party. The two great parties, which have historically defended peace, which have been the centre of gravity in terms of peace, have suffered damage. We must analyse why this situation has come about. It will primarily be their job to do this. We have seen that the Secretary-General of the Meretz Party has tendered his resignation. But, in any event, from a European point of view we must maintain our policy and our policy is still the one contained in the work of the Quartet and the one contained in the road map which was approved in Washington not long ago. Once there is a government in Israel, we must mobilise all possible mechanisms in order to speed up a process which will lead to the road map becoming a reality and not just remaining a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have the obligation, as Europeans, to do everything possible to ensure that this process, which will begin following yesterday’s elections, will be a process which leads to a good result, and so that the initiatives taken do not meet the same fate as previous initiatives, such as the Mitchell report or the Tenet Plan and other important reports which have been adopted but which have not been able to be implemented. My appeal would therefore be that we should do everything possible to ensure that these documents do not remain simply documents in the archives but that they be implemented in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, during the short time available to me for this first speech, I would also like to make one or two comments on North Korea. Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in North Korea is serious. It is difficult. As you know, the decisions taken by the North Korean Government are serious decisions and I do not believe they are decisions which should only concern the countries of the region. As I said at the beginning, I would insist that the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an issue which affects all of us, regardless of which part of the planet we are living in at this time. And we must therefore involve ourselves to some extent in the issue of North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we hold meetings and telephone conversations practically every day with the most closely involved countries in the region: South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, the United States, and in the General Affairs Council on Monday the decision was taken, if necessary, to send a European Union mission to North Korea to present our position and also to cooperate in finding a solution to this dramatic problem which, if things carry on as they are, could lead to the existence of nuclear weapons of mass destruction in part of the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will move on to the last point I wanted to mention this afternoon, which is the situation in the Balkans and specifically the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. As you know, at the Copenhagen Summit an agreement was reached on relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance. We are currently working so that in March we can for the first time in history deploy a peace-keeping force in that Republic. The work is going well, the issues that have to be tackled with the Atlantic Alliance are making substantial progress, President Trajkovski of Macedonia has now accepted the presence of European forces from March and I believe we will be in a position to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to send a clear message to the countries of the Balkans; our strategy is not to abandon the Balkans. Our strategy does not just consist of remaining there, but of them remaining with us, of offering the countries of the Balkans the opportunity to participate in the construction of a wider Europe, so that they may come ever closer to the European institutions and so that they may establish themselves firmly as the important countries they should be in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">The deployment of military force in Macedonia would be the second peace-keeping operation taken on by Europe, since, as you know, since 1 January this year, the European police force is deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a replacement for the police force which was there under the flag of the United Nations. Therefore, in a relatively short space of time, we have been able to implement two peace-keeping operations in an area close to our hearts and close geographically to our capitals and to Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I do not want to expand any further during this first speech. I know that the honourable Members will have plenty of questions to ask me. But I would like to say that we are living through a relatively difficult time and I would go as far as to say that this is perhaps the most difficult time those of us in this parliamentary sitting, during this period of European parliamentary life, have had to live through. It is essential that we Europeans remain strong, clear and tenacious in our positions in order to do everything possible so that this crisis, which currently has so many fronts and so many manifestations, is one that can be resolved through the good will of everybody by means of agreement, dialogue and diplomacy. Force is the last resort. Diplomacy must always be our method.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, since at the last session of the Parliament in Strasbourg I was able to spend an hour with the Foreign Affairs Committee discussing North Korea under the benign stewardship of my honourable friend, the Member for Westphalia, and since last week we were able to spend two hours with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy here discussing a wide range of issues, perhaps I could now concentrate on Iraq, bearing in mind the limitations imposed on the competences of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one remark at the outset: I think it is fair to say that, on the whole, since the Second World War, we have managed to create global institutions and international agreements which have helped make the world a much more prosperous and peaceful place. I recall that, at the time of President Clinton's second inaugural address, he was able to boast that there are today more people living under democracies than under tyrannies; we ended the last century with a world which produced as much in two or three years as we had produced in the whole of the 19th century, with incalculable consequences for the living standards of most people. This is not a bad record after a century which began so badly.</p>
<p class="contents">Plainly, not everything has gone so well. Perhaps the greatest failure in trying to create a global rule-book has been our collective failure to establish an adequate regime for controlling and preventing the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons – that terrible arsenal of unimaginable horror.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we face some of the consequences in three of the world's most worrying trouble spots: in Kashmir, in the Korean peninsular and in the Gulf. How can we deal with these problems? This was a point discussed in considerable detail in the Foreign Affairs Committee last week. Clearly, we have to mobilise the greatest international commitment and the broadest authority for what we want to do. That is why it must be sensible to base our approach in dealing with these problems on the moral and legal authority of the United Nations. I think the whole of the European Parliament would believe that it was right to try to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone knows that, for years, Saddam Hussein has defied the authority of the United Nations over his manufacture, possession and use of weapons of mass destruction. In addition, he has an appalling record on human rights. In May last year, this Parliament adopted a resolution based on a report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne which outlined the clear evidence concerning the brutal and oppressive nature of his regime. The report illustrated clearly how Saddam normally deals with Iraqi citizens, with his neighbours and with the international community. We know, for example, that he has used chemical weapons on his own people.</p>
<p class="contents">After years of defying the authority of the United Nations, posing a threat to the region and to the whole world, he was given a final chance to cooperate in disarming his country by United Nations Security Council resolution 1441. A team of 260 staff members from 60 countries, of whom 100 are UNMOVIC inspectors, has been working in Iraq since 27 November 2002 under Dr Blix. Besides UNMOVIC, there is also the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team under Dr El Baradei.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the resumption of IAEA inspections, 139 inspections have been carried out on 106 sites, including two presidential sites. I just mention, in passing, that anybody who has met the inspectors – for example, anybody who has met Dr Blix – will have been extremely impressed by the integrity and professionalism of those leading this UN operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to pronounce on the debate which is being held today in the Security Council. As I am regularly reminded, the Commission is not a Member State. We do, of course, contribute to the development of the common foreign and security policy. We deploy the instruments within our competence to make it more effective. Many of the issues we are discussing go to the heart of the debate about national sovereignty, which some appear to think has been solved by the proposal to create a full-time President of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">While being clear about the limits of our role, let me however make a number of points. First, it must be plain to all that the authority of the United Nations should be a paramount consideration. The pity is that in the past we have stood by too often while the United Nations has been defied, thereby exposing ourselves to understandable charges of double standards.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Second, Saddam Hussein must work with the UN inspectors under Dr Blix to get rid of those weapons of mass destruction for which he has not yet accounted. We should not forget that the issue at the heart of this crisis is how Saddam Hussein treats the rest of the world, not how the rest of the world treats Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget the sobering comment made this week by Dr Blix. I quote: Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, if inspectors can disarm Saddam Hussein, that is preferable by far to any other imaginable cause of action.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Any sensible person should want this crisis to be ended peacefully, if it is humanly possible to do so. It would be good for the United Nations if we could accomplish this task without casualty, collateral damage or the daunting consequence of military intervention. It would also be good for Iraq, for the region and, I would argue, very good for the world. But that does rather assume that Saddam Hussein will now work with the inspectors. Unfortunately, we have little evidence even now that he has yet learned that he cannot go on defying world opinion forever.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always believed that the terms of the UN resolution obliged us to face two realities: first, we must make a serious effort to disarm through inspection; second, if the inspectors make it clear that this is a case of mission impossible, we cannot avoid facing up to the consequences. The alternative would be the sort of humiliation that would make it more difficult to assert the authority of the United Nations in future cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this to be an exceptionally serious debate and one which is going to have effects not just in this chamber but across Europe and the world. It is going to shape the sort of world we live in and pass on to our kids and I do not think it is going to be helped by trading rhetoric. Speaking like my youthful partner and friend, the High Representative, both of us have grown younger in these jobs. Speaking like him as a proud citizen of old Europe – a part of old Europe which once had a spot of trouble with one of our colonies on the other side of the Atlantic – I have occasionally reflected that if King George had not played his hand so badly, if he had not made such a mess of things, then instead of fetching up as the last Governor of Hong Kong I might have finished up as the Governor of Arkansas or Texas, and then who knows what might have happened!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as a citizen of old Europe, I would say that we need to remember that it is often wiser to raise a quizzical eyebrow than to return an insult.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise that if we get this wrong and handle this crisis badly, the consequences could be profoundly serious and very long-lived: on the one hand, we could fatally damage the institutions of global cooperation and governance; on the other, we could make the world a much more dangerous place. We could weaken partnerships between friends, exacerbate relations with the Islamic world and worsen the prospects for solving crises elsewhere, for example in the Middle East. Our ability to work together in Europe is also clearly on the line.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the Commission will discharge its responsibilities as best it can. While I do not believe it is helpful to go into detail about the planning we have done to cater for a serious humanitarian crisis – for example, I was discussing this last autumn in Jordan – I can assure honourable Members that we will react with the generosity for which the Parliament is ultimately responsible and with the commitment and professionalism that the Parliament would expect of us. I make this point very, very strongly: it will be easier for us to act, should we be required to act, if we can do so with the authority of the United Nations covering our activities. I think I owe it to all those who work for the European Commission in the front line in providing humanitarian assistance, and to those who work for non-governmental organisations, very often in dangerous circumstances. If we have to talk in the future about humanitarian activities and about what is described in the jargon as the humanitarian space, then I say strongly to this Parliament that it is far easier and far better to have UN authority covering that humanitarian space than to go ahead without it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Earlier I mentioned speaking in the last Parliamentary session on North Korea and I will not repeat all that I said to the Foreign Affairs Committee on that occasion, but I do recognise the seriousness of the situation in North Korea. I was in Pyongyang with the High Representative and the Swedish Prime Minister almost two years ago. I think that we played a useful role, without exaggerating what we were capable of doing. In my judgment, the only way this crisis can be resolved is through diplomacy, through expecting more of the DPRK, on this occasion in relation to nuclear promises in response to a greater commitment by the international community to welcome North Korea into the real world. Since I think it is only through diplomacy that we can actually resolve that crisis, I do think there may be a role for the European Union to play in the coming weeks. That, I am glad to say, was the decision reached by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday and Tuesday. I am sure this will not be the last occasion on which we debate soberly these difficult issues, soberly but with a passion which I hope will be sometimes constrained in its rhetorical expression by the grave and serious issues that we are discussing.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to decide between war and peace, we must conduct our debate with the greatest seriousness, but also with confidence in ourselves. The wisdom of old Europe, this continent of ours, lies in its capacity for repeated renewal, and we should be telling all those who cast doubt on our credentials, that the policy of uniting Europe is the greatest peace movement on the European continent – old, yet ever renewing itself – and that perhaps other regions in the world will find it an example of peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">What I ask, ladies and gentlemen, is that we should respect each other's points of view. It is certain that we will come to different conclusions on one thing or another, but each of us expresses opinions founded on his or her own convictions, and then we have to see to it that we take the right path. It is quite clear to us in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats that we have to make every conceivable effort and attempt to secure world peace and peace in the Middle East – in so far as this is the nub of the problem. That must be our concern; it is that for which we must work, and the United Nations is the framework within which we must do it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, even if the use of force in the form of warfare may never be more than the last resort, and though our endeavours must be guided by peace, we have to deal with the facts as they are presented to us.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to deal with in Iraq is a criminal system under a dictator and tyrant alleged to have weapons of mass destruction at his disposal – and that is the problem. He is a mass murderer and a war criminal, who, as Commissioner Patten has mentioned, has, in particular, used chemical weapons against his own people, against the Kurds. In 1980, he declared war on Iran, and in 1990 he invaded Kuwait. I take a thoroughly critical line on the United States too, but, ladies and gentlemen, if the United States had not, at that time, led the coalition that liberated Kuwait, might this same dictator not have been able to include the other Arab countries in his expansionist designs? That, too, is something we must bear in mind today. His regime uses its secret services to oppress his own people with violence, murder and terror.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein and his regime are a menace to the region as a whole and to the international community. Whatever the need to be frank when talking to our American friends, it has to be said that the heart of the problem is not the USA, but Saddam Hussein's criminal regime in Baghdad.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies, gentlemen, friends, because Iraq, with which we find ourselves dealing in the present situation, is an Arab country, we are also saying loud and clear to the Arab and Muslim world that we want cooperation, we want partnership, and we want friendship – if at all possible – with all Arab and Muslim states, and this must be one of the key fundamentals of European Union policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to extend warm thanks not only to Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, but also to all those who are working hard in these difficult days and weeks, and I wish to thank the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, for facilitating yesterday's discussion with Hans Blix, from which I learned a very great deal. We agreed that this discussion would be confidential – it could scarcely have taken place had we not done so – but I agree, and our group agrees, that many years have passed since 1990, in which the international community has taken no real action against Saddam Hussein, and so, if we are to achieve the peaceful solution for which we hope, we have to keep up the pressure of recent months, which he is now coming to feel.</p>
<p class="contents">This has to be a window for peace; it must also mean – and it is to be hoped that it does – that our American partners and friends have not yet decided on military action against Iraq. We have to be open to a truly peaceful solution, which must be reached through the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must also, however, keep reminding ourselves of the logic involved. The discussion we had with Dr Blix yesterday touched on this. Logic cannot require the inspectors to travel the length and breadth of Iraq to look to see where something might be. It is far more logical for the Iraqi regime to do as Resolution 1441 requires and actually open the gates, so that Dr Blix and his team do not have to virtually grope their way through Iraq with a glimmering lamp. On the contrary, as Mr Solana has said and as is stated in Resolution 1441, what is required is genuinely active cooperation by the regime in Baghdad. That is what we have to insist on, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">We hear the President's White House spokesman saying, ‘either he disarms or he will be disarmed’, and so we urge Saddam Hussein to delay no longer in playing his part in this. Let me quote Hans Blix, who said, on one occasion, that ‘it does not, to date, appear that Iraq has really accepted the demand for disarmament’, and on another, that paragraph 9 of Resolution 1441 requires that cooperation be ‘active’. Simply opening doors is not enough. There are questions that Hans Blix has raised, and which we also have to put before the public: what about the anthrax, which is a biological weapon? What became of the 8 500 litres of it? What about the VX, a toxic chemical weapon on which further development work has been done?</p>
<p class="contents">If Iraq really has disarmed as it claims to have done, it would have been right and proper and in line with international law for this to have been done under UN supervision, as prescribed by the documents and the resolutions. I hope that Iraq will be more cooperative over the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council of European Union Foreign Ministers decided, quite rightly, to call for complete disarmament, but we have to take the middle way – and everyone knows the difficult position Europeans are in. Our slogan cannot be ‘right or wrong, always America!’<span class="italic"> </span>That is a road down which we cannot go, but neither can we go down the road of saying that, no matter what Iraq's response may be, the Iraqi dictator will go unpunished, and that we will not play our part!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">To do so would be like saying to someone bent upon murder, ‘please don't commit murder, but if you do, there will be no criminal proceedings anyway’. That is why we have to keep up the pressure!</p>
<p class="contents">What we demand of the US Government is that, if our American partners and friends have intelligence derived from secret service operations, this must also be laid out to public view in the Security Council, so that we may really be in full possession of the facts. People have to be informed, and so we are very decidedly of the opinion that Iraq must dispose of any weapons of mass destruction that it possesses. We want to achieve this through the United Nations, and we want to achieve it by peaceful means!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr High Representative, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to say first of all that we are against war: no to war and no to dictators, and that means we must work actively within a multilateral framework to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we are holding at the moment with our most important ally, the United States, revolves, rather than around the fundamental issue, around counter-productive methods and – as ex-President Clinton quite rightly said − on erratic methods. Why? Because ten years ago, when we were in a coalition with the United States in the Kuwait war, President Bush Senior said that the Iraqi people would sooner or later topple the dictator.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years later, we must recognise that sanctions have not weakened Saddam Hussein and that we are still dealing with the same issues in relation to weapons of mass destruction. We must therefore say that we are in favour of a clear policy of applying pressure on the basis of the Security Council’s resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">War is not inevitable. We must work on the basis that peace must be given a chance, but we must not be hasty and of course we must not create situations which may be entirely counter-productive. Hence our opposition to a preventive attack and our support for negotiations within the framework of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a unilateral intervention, without the support of the UN, would have devastating effects throughout the Middle East, leading to more suffering, more radicalisation of Arab public opinion and would jeopardise the spirit of coalition in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">And since Mr Solana is going to congratulate Mr Sharon on having won the elections in Israel, I would ask him to add something else, and that is to tell Mr Sharon to stop spurning Europe and to take account of our will for peace and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Iraq must comply seriously with the inspection requirements and I would like to thank the President for quickly accepting my proposal to hold the videoconference. It was very interesting. Yesterday we spoke with a European citizen who was proud to be one, Dr Blix, who asked Europe to take a more active position and who also explained to us, although he did not ask for it, that if the inspections could continue for two more months, as proposed by Mohammed ElBaradei, the Egyptian expert, results could be achieved. I believe that that should be the basis for the European course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach should be the one the President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Papandreu, was able to outline at the General Affairs Council on Monday, in the face of the self-flagellation we always indulge in, by means of an agreement with the four member countries of the Security Council and with Bulgaria, so that there may be a European position which supports the work of the inspectors and so that those inspections may continue. I would also like to point out that Dr Blix also told us that between 1991 and 1998 the inspectors were at work. If they were working for eight years, why can they not work for two more months? Nobody understands this, and neither do they understand why President Bush is offering evidence now, two months later. Why did he not do so before?</p>
<p class="contents">We must all work as faithful allies and with regard to the statement of Defence Secretary Rumsfeld, who spoke of the old Europe, I must say that those people in our continent who have spoken of a new Europe are the ones who have caused endless disasters in our continent. We are not in favour of a new Europe, we are building a united Europe, and that is the aim of our political action.</p>
<p class="contents">And, Mr President, please allow me to refer to an important aspect of the issue on which I would like to hear more clarifications from the representative of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission. It concerns the risks of humanitarian disaster, not only in Iraq but throughout the Middle East, with hundreds of thousands of displaced persons at least: who will pay for that? Do we have measures to deal with it? Has the UN considered this? This is an important issue, as is the economic situation, and not just that of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The price of oil is going through the roof; it is worrying that the United States’ world map of priorities always coincides with the countries which have significant reserves of oil. This is not the way to build a future for humanity, and we must also declare ourselves clearly in favour of not having to face an economic disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, we have the right to know whether weapons of mass destruction really exist. To this end, we need more proof and more evidence and they will be obtained through continued work.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate is not only on the timetable but on how to move forward in order to prevent war. And finally, Mr President, please allow me to use a quote in English from a great American, Mr Madison, who in 1792 said: </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, with four Member States on the UN Security Council, including the chair, the EU should have the opportunity for real influence over current events and it would if it spoke with one voice. I wonder if Mr Solana would confirm that the meeting of four Security Council members, convened by the Greek Presidency ahead of Monday's General Affairs Council, was intended to achieve a single EU position? Will such meetings become regular events? Or was it simply an attempt to stitch up the outcome of the Council without consulting the remaining Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I could also ask whether, in the regrettable absence of a coherent EU strategy in the run-up to a possible conflict with Iraq, he would undertake to ensure that the EU starts work now to plan a post-conflict strategy in the region?</p>
<p class="contents">When we last debated the situation in Iraq in early September, the world seemed on the brink of a unilateral military adventure led by the United States. Our main concerns then were to prevent the credibility of the United Nations and of international law being undermined by a pre-emptive strike not authorised by the UN, and to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq. We may be the old continent but we remember our yesterdays rather well and our experience of war has been very different from that of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event, the United States did go the UN route last autumn, and secured a unanimous vote for a tough Security Council resolution. The UN weapons inspectors have been readmitted to Iraq and are doing a professional and thorough job. So we Liberals salute the efforts of Colin Powell, Hans Blix, Mohamed Elbaradei and others for reinforcing the multilateral rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are engaged on the proper path of international cooperation, we must make every effort to preserve that unity. However, following the presentation of Dr Blix's report to the Security Council, there is a new danger – a danger that the credibility of the UN and international law risks being undermined, not by unilateral US action, but by the failure of the international community to ensure that Iraq rids itself of weapons of mass destruction once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Dr Blix's report to the UN provides a damning if not yet conclusive account of Iraq's failure to cooperate fully with the UN weapons inspectors. Saddam Hussein is required by UN resolution 1441 to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Instead, we have seen half-truths, prevarication and evasion. Dr Blix has opened the case for the prosecution with powerful arguments, though the evidence he has presented does not yet provide proof beyond all reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Liberals in this House insist that the inspectors be allowed to continue their work. Dr Blix raises many disturbing questions in his report. Saddam Hussein clearly has a case to answer. A peaceful resolution to the crisis is still possible provided that Iraq now demonstrates a real willingness to cooperate with the UN in disarming. But with the inspectors due to report again on 14 February, there is little time left to him before the court of the international community has to reach a verdict.</p>
<p class="contents">For Liberals, war will always be a last resort; recourse to military action means that the instruments of international governance in which we invest such high hopes have failed. But equally, the international community has to stand ready to enforce its will, or the rule of law will be flouted. And there is plenty of evidence that Saddam Hussein is in breach of international law, most notably of the UN Convention on Genocide for the murder of half a million marsh Arabs. So let us forget talk of allowing Saddam Hussein to slip off quietly into the night for a comfortable exile in a third country. He is a war criminal and he must be brought before the International Criminal Court. To those Members who intend to convey to Saddam Hussein the message that impunity in exile is an acceptable way out, I say, to borrow the phrase of the anti-war coalition: not in our name. And I invite them to search their consciences. Is the best way to advance the cause of peace really to travel to Baghdad for a photo opportunity and risk being manipulated by the Iraqi regime?</p>
<p class="contents">Dr Blix told us yesterday that if Iraq chooses to cooperate, the inspectors can complete their work very soon. The inspectors must be given more time but if Dr Blix reports on 14 February that Iraq has failed to provide answers to his questions, and if the Security Council therefore determines that they are in material breach of the resolution, then the international community has a responsibility to act. If Iraq does not seize this final opportunity to cooperate, we must act together through the UN to enforce resolution 1441. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, the Security Council has given the inspectors the green light they wanted to continue their mission in the short term; on the other, the US-British armada in the Gulf is increasing in size by the day, much like the pressure to launch a military attack. In this context of great tension where the stakes are so high, any ambiguous political words or action on the war, but also, where applicable, any absence of initiative against the war, actually constitute an advantage for the most aggressive and unilateralist government the United States has ever known. A builder’s work can be recognised from its foundations, and, in the same way, Europe’s ambition on the global stage can be measured in a critical international situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, you seem to welcome the common position of the Fifteen, or in any case of the four countries that currently sit on the Security Council. This does not merit such rejoicing. The declaration had only just been published when London and Madrid, in particular, were already stripping it of its substance by stating, respectively, that there was a flagrant violation of resolution 1441, and that the extension of the deadline granted to the inspectors should be as short as possible. Still others are doing their utmost to find passages in Dr Blix’s report to take out of context in order to try to justify military intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything seems to imply that, in the eyes of some, it would not be good news but bad news if Dr Blix were to state that the inspectors had been able, overall, to access all sites easily, to the point of having carried out 300 inspections in 60 days. Or if Mr ElBaradei thought it were possible, and I quote ‘within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme’.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there are still grey areas that absolutely must be clarified. We will not, however, achieve this through bombs and blood. We must speak frankly and on the other hand be far more aggressive in demanding that the inspectors be allowed to take the time they need to complete their work. Beware of playing down war! Beware of gradually and insidiously accepting the unacceptable! Let us therefore review everything that Europe has accepted, with little or no reaction, from Ariel Sharon in Palestine over the past two years. He does not deserve congratulations, Mr Solana. We must resolutely fight his disastrous policy, including for the Israeli people themselves.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What did Europe have to say about George Bush’s new strategic doctrine, published on 20 September last, which magnifies, and I quote, ‘the unequalled strength’ of the United States and emphasises, and I quote once again, their determination ‘to act alone, if necessary […] pre-emptively’ in order to ‘further freedom’s triumph’. What does Europe have to say now in response to the irresponsible statements made by the Secretary-General of the White House last Sunday, implying that the United States would not rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in case of conflict in Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed and banned in Iraq, throughout the region, and all over the world. We must listen to public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair and Mr Aznar are isolated in their own countries over the question of war. There is an overwhelming majority against war in Germany. Four out of five French citizens are asking Paris to use the right to veto if necessary to try to prevent the worst from happening. On the other side of the Atlantic, a movement unprecedented since Vietnam is gathering momentum, based on the slogan, and how clear it is: ‘No blood for oil’<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mr Le Pen: It sounds like Europe in 1938!)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Calm down! We are not interested in hearing what you think about it.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would like to be able to state these values, state these requirements in Iraq itself, without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, Mr Watson, quite the opposite – nobody, furthermore, will find in my entire political history the slightest leniency towards this dictator, nobody, which is not the case of certain right-wing governments – ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, therefore, and within a population that has already suffered the effects of a criminal embargo for twelve years. That is why my group is unanimous, as are my Green and socialist fellow Members, and even Members from other parliamentary groups, in suggesting that a delegation of Members should go to Baghdad from 2 to 6 February. There will be more than thirty of us. In the same vein, my group suggests sending – and will do so – a delegation to the United States. In Baghdad and in New York or Washington, we want to defend an idea of Europe, Mr President, in which many progressive men and women still place their hopes. We must not let them down!</p>

Personally, I would like to make a suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously nobody here today is defending a dictator. Those who were communist no longer are, and are not defending any communist dictatorships. I also think that none of those who visited Saddam Hussein to deliver nuclear power stations to him, or, for example, like that young American who was close to the Secretary of State at the time, going by the name of Mr Rumsfeld, to deliver chemical weapons to be dropped on Iran, would now do what they did at the time.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We should take note of this, but the problem lies elsewhere. The problem is the credibility of an international institution when it comes to imposing something defined intelligently by a German sociologist: ‘Make law, not war’. The problem today is knowing whether we are capable of imposing international law. In this situation – as Mr Patten and Mr Solana have said – the argument is this: if Iraq does not cooperate, we shall have to force it to disarm. You are therefore advocating military intervention in the short or medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, within the context of international order, we must define those situations in which we should fight dictatorships and those in which we should use diplomatic means. I am indeed saying that I, who, often against my group or other groups, have defended and still defend military intervention in Kosovo and Afghanistan. I also believe it was right, once again against the majority of my group, to intervene when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, but I believe that today, Saddam Hussein has not been so weak for ten years or so. He is a bloodthirsty dictator who is weak and who is now incapable of attacking other countries. That is the distinction in the fight against dictatorships: those which act against other countries and those which do not.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, with regard to butchery, ladies and gentlemen: four million dead in Uganda, with machetes, not with weapons of mass destruction, they killed each other with machetes. What did we do? Who intervened to stop this bloodletting? Nobody! Nobody intervened! So, let us stay calm. We have seen millions of deaths, blood, and nobody was interested: there was no oil. We took years to intervene in Bosnia: there was no oil. So let us moderate our great speeches on dictatorships, and murders, and dying children.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a problem, however. Iran now possesses missiles. Iran is currently equipping itself with a nuclear arsenal. Iran could now attack Israel, Europe, Greece and reach these regions. Is anyone suggesting a military foray into Iran? Obviously not! That would be too dangerous. Today, North Korea has said it wants to produce nuclear weapons. Is anyone suggesting military intervention? Of course not! That would be too dangerous. With the arguments developed with regard to Iraq, we are creating a programme of nuclear proliferation. We are telling dictators to possess weapons of mass destruction so that nobody attacks them! That is the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must step back. Fine, the Americans and the English are surrounding Iraq, so Iraq cannot move. So we have time. We can wait a year. We can say that the soldiers should stay where they are. At the same time, however, let us show the world what we are capable of. Let us solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem while still threatening Saddam Hussein. Let us change the agenda and our priorities. That said, let us not fool ourselves, if the inspectors are there now, it is because the soldiers are present. Let us take advantage of this situation, however, to contain the problem and avoid making war. At the same time, let us try to obtain negotiations with the Middle East. I believe that Ariel Sharon will form a coalition forcing him to negotiate with the Palestinians. First of all he must be forced to let the Palestinians elect their own representatives so that they can negotiate with the Israelis. Let us change the agenda. Let us find a solution to the Middle East and you will see that the Arab masses will applaud us if we have to sort out Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">If initially, however, we first sort out Saddam Hussein, perhaps for oil, without having taken and carried out any initiative in the Middle East, we will not be credible and we will not create greater justice in the world. So, ‘make law, not war’, change the agenda, give us time, stay there for a year or two. We will disarm Saddam Hussein, but first of all let us find a solution to the Middle East.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Queiró (UEN). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(PT)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, in our opinion, the essential question now in relation to the Iraqi crisis is how the international community should act in the face of the threat from a dictatorial regime that might or might not have – this is what is being investigated – the capacity to develop or acquire, when they only have access to scarce technical and financial resources, weapons of mass destruction, be they biological or chemical, likely to endanger regional safety and world peace, and potentially to use or supply these to others, particularly terrorists. The question is how to deal with an undemocratic regime that has breached and continues systematically to breach its international commitments and obligations within the United Nations. This is also a regime that has imposed all kinds of constraints on its people, demonstrating total contempt for their most basic political, economic and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the issue is not, as some have said, America’s control of Iraq’s oil resources, even if Iraq does have the world’s second largest oil reserves and on top of that, its crude oil is of the very highest quality. This is not the issue, because if it were, we would clearly have to acknowledge that there are also European interests in this area. In fact, the European Union is already seeing many Iraqi oil transactions taking place in euros and, due to their volume, these transactions contribute considerably to the strength and stability of the European currency as a means of international payment. To take just one example, we could mention the contracts that Russian oil and gas companies have signed with Iraqi companies, which, according to the press, total 40 billion euros (not dollars).</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, when we criticise a policy, we must come up with alternative proposals and solutions. We cannot simply oppose options that some consider to be warmongering; we must provide a response that is proportionate to the threats made by the other side, in the shape of someone who, in the past, has shown complete contempt for international law and who is still failing to provide guarantees that he will respect such law now and in future. We are the first to say that the solution to the conflict must be sought up to the last minute through peaceful and diplomatic means, but we also maintain that the international community, under the auspices of the United Nations, must maintain a firm attitude that leaves no room for doubt as to the need for the Iraqi authorities to cooperate fully and extremely soon with the UN inspectors. If they do not cooperate, they will have to face other means being used to make them do so.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of fact, it is worth asking whether dictators who generally rule without any constraint and particularly without the democratic scrutiny of their public, only understand and respect the language of diplomacy, the language that has always been used, as Javier Solana said, when it is backed up and given credibility by the means of coercion available to it, the last resort, as he also said? We support the work of the UN inspectors and hope that they are given all the means and all the information necessary to conclude their task, and I mean all information, even information already available to other countries. At the same time, however, we must issue a warning about the need to prevent the Iraqis from indulging in time-wasting manoeuvres in order to put off complying with the UN resolutions without good reason and to ensure that the current status quo remains in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we make a clear distinction between Iraq’s totalitarian regime and its people. As I said, the Iraqi people have been the main victims of the oligarchy governing them and which uses them to achieve its own ends. This is precisely why we are calling on the international community to unite on the fundamental issue, for the transatlantic relationship to be strengthened, for the conditions to be established to ensure that we do not see the inspections blocked, constraints put on the evidence given by scientists and officials linked to Iraq’s nuclear programmes and that this game of hide and seek with arsenals of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein’s supporters is brought to an end. If we achieve this, if we unite on the fundamental issue, the conditions might then be created for beginning the process of democratisation in Iraq and for enabling its people to enjoy the advantages of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ideologically ‘legitimised’ obsession with power on the part of dictators created millions of victims. They certainly did not spare their own citizens. Is the parallel with the loathsome regime of Saddam Hussein not obvious here? We should therefore be talking about ‘liberation’ and not ‘war’ in respect of Iraq. At least that is how Saddam’s <span class="italic">living</span> victims see it.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly enough, they cannot count on the unanimous support of the Member States of the European Union in this regard. In fact the opposite is true. The concept of the containment of Saddam’s reign of terror is evidently being fostered in the European Union despite all the extremely negative experiences with Baghdad’s Ba’athists over the past 10 years. Today this strategy is being continued in the European desire to extend the UN inspections in Iraq. That Saddam is again flouting a compulsory Security Council resolution does not spoil the European illusion of Saddam’s total disarmament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is first and foremost the inhabitants of Mesopotamia who are the ongoing victims of the international community’s failure to appreciate the true nature of Saddam’s ‘Republic of Fear’. Do the Member States of the European Union want to have this on their consciences, particularly given their own painful experiences during the last century? Furthermore, Iraq under Saddam remains a permanent potential threat to the entire Middle East, not least on account of her oil reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Desperate diseases need desperate remedies, as the saying goes. War is awful, but the consequences of an overly tolerant attitude may in time cause more devastation.

There is no Iraqi crisis, but an extremely serious international crisis deliberately created by the Bush administration. It is not the dictator Saddam Hussein who is the warmonger. The warmonger is Bush, the democrat. Iraqi aircraft carriers are not manoeuvring along the coasts of New England, nor are Iraqi marines taking up position in Mexico, Canada or Cuba. It is the Anglo-American armada that is reviving gunboat diplomacy in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Why was the alleged need to disarm Iraq not brought to light before the election of Bush junior? Nobody honestly believes that Iraq, a small country with twenty million inhabitants, surrounded by hostile or suspicious countries, whose army and economic infrastructures were levelled by Desert Storm, whose people have been ruined by ten years of Anglo-American bombing and by an embargo which has killed, amongst others, over a million children who have died from poverty and hunger; nobody believes that this small country, monitored by satellites and by spy planes, by the UN inspectors, could have assembled an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and threaten world peace. Furthermore, this is the gist of the report by one of the main UN inspectors, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">Was Saddam Hussein not already a dictator when he received weapons of all kinds from the United States, Europe, France, and even Jacques Chirac? I am thinking of the nuclear reactor at Osirak which was destroyed by the Israelis in an aerial attack during peacetime. Please, let us not be hypocritical! Let us stop acting out humanitarian indignation. The United States, whose oil stocks will be used up in ten years’ time and which consumes one quarter of the 3.5 billion tonnes used by the planet, and which, furthermore, cannot allow the price per barrel to exceed USD 30, wants to make war to take Iraqi oil and control oil in the Gulf. It is the American giant, the super-power with 80% of the weapons of mass destruction in the world, and, amongst others, 8000 nuclear warheads, terrifying weapons, which, moreover, it is the only country in the history of the world to have used, that wants to make war.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana wants to disarm Iraq and hunt down the dictators of the world. The latter point constitutes a huge programme which would oblige the United States to attack many of its allies. With regard to the fight against international terrorism and pursuing it in the places in which it prospers, the Americans could start by bombing London, which is the main place where this type of thing goes on. Deep in your conscience, you think that the Americans are also working on behalf of Europe, and that is why, eyes lowered, you will allow them to commit the first great crime against humanity of the twenty-first century. You have waited thirty years to discover that Saddam Hussein used poison gas against the Kurds. Well, there was a precursor: in 1920, in Kurdistan, in the form of Winston Churchill! In terms of mass destruction, do you think that the powers in question have never used them and can therefore preach to the world about international morals? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For if you add up the number of operations the European Union has mounted in Bosnia and in Macedonia, and consider the great burden that European forces in Afghanistan are taking upon themselves, as well as the fact that the European Union devotes three times as much of its budget to overseas aid as does the United States of America, all these important factors are, in my view, things of which old Europe can be proud.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should also remember that the achievements that this month has seen – the eastward and southward enlargement of the European Union and the consequent extension of the zone of stability and democracy – play a decisive part in making the world more peaceful. The primary motive for the enlargement of the European Union is that it will extend the stability zone. I think that we should make that point by incorporating this into the integrated approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Hitherto, admittedly, we lacked the ability to speak with one voice when it came to issues of war and peace, a defect dating back as far as last summer.

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it must also be clear in this context – if we are honest with ourselves – that if we are to get our voice heard everywhere, be it in New York, Washington, or Baghdad, it will only be by attempting to work out a common position based on the knowledge that this is the only way. This is the road we must take, rather than following others on their celebratory processions, whether these be to Baghdad or to Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is my belief that we should now press on with the endeavour that the Council has – God be thanked – set in motion this week, which, for the time being at least, gave us a halfway reasonable position, with the multilateral approach being particularly valued and preferred, and with the attempt being made, within the UN framework, at finding a peaceful solution. It must, however, be made clear that this must be kept up to the very end. This is a consensus that does not just last for eight days, but one that must be made to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, any consideration of these matters must of course have as its starting point the view of the international community – expressed, for example, in Resolution 1441 – that Iraqi disarmament must take place, and that Saddam Hussein must play an active part in it. Dr Blix, for example, has stated that these conditions have not been met, and so it is a good thing that the efforts of many have gained us a breathing space, time that must be used to find a peaceful solution, by which I mean the dismantling of the weapons of mass destruction – insofar as they actually exist – and the disarmament of Iraq, thus enabling the will of the international community, as expressed in international law, to prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, Dr Blix's inspectors need to have the same information as is held by those who claim they were already aware that there was something there and that they would at some point present the facts to the public. In my view, Dr Blix should be told the facts right now, for how are we to explain to the public that a war is inevitable if we do not tell even our allies' inspectors the whole truth, thus enabling them to find what they are looking for? It seems to me that something of a credibility gap is developing here, one that may cause a great deal of damage in days to come.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not, however, be forgotten, when considering this issue, that Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer. Baroness Nicholson and I were in an Iranian camp for Iraqi refugees, and I have seen how people had to live there, having been driven from their homes and tormented by Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons. The depiction of Saddam Hussein as someone who represents no real danger does not strike me as credible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we should also be clear in our own minds about the real menace of weapons of mass destruction when they are in the hands of people such as Saddam Hussein, particularly if he is to emerge from this conflict as the victor, with all the resulting effects on the region's morale.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be stating what is to happen once the war is over. What form is political reconstruction to take? For how long will Western troops have to remain there? To what extent does this relate to the creation of a new order in the region as a whole, what sort of new order will that be, and at what cost? To date, I have heard no answer to these questions, and I believe that if you are going to go into something, you have to think about how you are going to get out again.</p>

For the right to self-defence presupposes not merely the possibility of an attack, but that an attack is actually happening or is imminent. Warfare with the aim of averting danger would nullify international law's prohibition of force, promote political instability and, in the final analysis, shatter the foundations of the whole system of an international community of states.’ And elsewhere in the same statement: ‘Any security strategy committing itself to preventive warfare is in defiance both of Catholic teaching and of international law.’</p>
<p class="contents">These quotations are from the statement on the Iraq conflict issued, on 20 January of this year, by the Conference of German Bishops. As my Christian Democrat opposite number has not made reference to the Conference of Catholic Bishops, I have to do so, and do not think that these statements require anything to be added to them.</p>
<p class="contents">All the time I have known you, Mr Solana, I have regarded you as a great optimist, so when you say, as you have done today, that the political situation is bad, then the political situation is very bad. Donald Rumsfeld, the American minister for war, spoke of ‘old Europe’. All of us who have spoken here today have declared that we belong to this old Europe, and that would not be cause for any further excitement on our part, had he not drawn the distinction between us and the ‘new Europe’ – those whose opinions are identical with Mr Rumsfeld's and who think along the same lines as he does.</p>
<p class="contents">President Kwasniewski of Poland said in an interview last week, ‘If it is President Bush's vision, it is mine!’ The Polish President is of course entitled to as narrow a field of vision as he may choose, but there is no doubt that the Polish government – like all the governments of the other candidate countries – is under an obligation to act in solidarity with the European Union, to which they want to belong. The candidate countries have decided of their own free will to belong to the European Union, and we wish to welcome them, but, when it comes to issues of war and peace, preventive warfare and the setting-aside of international law, we expect them to be solidly alongside us.</p>

It is a very complex issue, and developments are taking place so quickly that the situation is changing almost from one day to the next. This means that any resolution becomes obsolete extremely quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party really appreciates the efforts you are making, Mr Solana, towards uniting the EU around a single policy. The Greek Presidency shares this ambition. It is no easy task. At the same time, it is very clear that the EU is not united. In all facets of the Iraq issue we have heard differing views from different capital cities. I dare say that it has never before been so evident that the EU has failed in developing a common foreign and security policy. For all the fine words and the rhetoric, we stand empty-handed; which is terribly tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be possible to compensate for this if we start now to make attempts to reach agreement on a strategy for what we want to see happening <span class="italic">after </span>Saddam Hussein, whether or not there is a war. What should be done with Saddam Hussein? What role should the EU play in the reconstruction process? How could peace, freedom, democracy and human rights be guaranteed for the people of Iraq, who have suffered for so long? How is the EU to help in improving the humanitarian situation, and how prepared are we to help the neighbouring countries with the refugees who are already pouring out of Iraq?</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we all hope that a war can be avoided. It is obvious that the inspectors, under the leadership of Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, need more time. Iraq and Saddam Hussein are playing games with us; one cannot help feeling that they have something to hide. Iraq must pull itself together. It is Iraq’s own responsibility, <span class="italic">not</span> that of the UN, to prove that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country. The question of war or peace lies in Iraq’s own hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view is that the inspectors need more time, a view expressed by many others here. When they report to the Security Council again in a few weeks’ time, it will be the UN Security Council that will take decisions on what is to happen next. Any decisions on a military strike, which might unfortunately be necessary, must be taken by the UN. A unilateral US strike would be extremely unfortunate, not only with regard to its consequences for the region, but also because it would harm transatlantic relations a very, very long way into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must express my regret that individual MEPs are going to Baghdad on their own initiative. I am convinced that they are doing so with good intentions, but this will be exploited by the Iraqi dictator to reinforce the image of disharmony in the international community. Those who go there <span class="italic">cannot</span> influence Saddam Hussein: he has not shown himself to be open to argument. Instead, they run the risk of becoming his hostages and getting in the way of the work of the inspectors. It is of course up to individuals whether or not they decide to travel, but the European Parliament is in danger of looking extremely ridiculous on the international stage. I would advise strongly against making this journey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who was it really that created Saddam Hussein? It was the United States, and they used him in the war against Iran. When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons of mass destruction against his own people, the United States was informed of the fact. An American attack on Iraq would not only be an attack on an individual country. It would be an attack on international law and upon the whole UN system. That is why it is important for Mr Solana and Mr Patten to call upon all the Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder in the EU on this matter in order to safeguard international law and to ensure a future for the UN. I think that Great Britain and Spain, specifically, should be called upon to show that they too join with the EU in rejecting war.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not of course be a war to disarm Iraq and introduce democracy there. Is it at all conceivable that the United States would install a Shia Muslim government in Iraq, reminiscent of the government in neighbouring Iran? Is that within the bounds of possibility? Could one imagine the United States allowing the Kurds their independence? Certainly, not much importance can be attached, then, to the talk of democracy. If the intention is to disarm Iraq, then that is the role assigned – rightly – to the weapons inspectors. If the desire is to disarm Iraq, it is a question of supporting the work being done by the weapons inspectors and Hans Blix.</p>
<p class="contents">There is of course also the alternative of strengthening democracy in Iraq by removing the sanctions, other than those concerned with chemical and other weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In that way, it would be possible to strengthen the Iraqi people and the democratic forces in Iraq, as well as democracy and peace for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have another task. It is to ensure that the whole region is inspected and that we obtain a policy for disarming it: not only Iraq but also Iran and Israel. In conclusion, I want to state that we must urge Saddam Hussein to cooperate with the weapons inspectors so that we avoid a war. I believe that the way forward is through democracy, development and cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are seeing a situation where the most powerful country in the world has made clear its determination to wage war against Iraq, with or without United Nations backing and whether or not the weapons inspectors find any weapons of mass destruction. A pre-emptive attack like this would set a new international precedent that has no basis in the United Nations Charter. Such a war on Iraq would be immoral, unjustifiable and illegal. It would make the world a much more dangerous place, causing more resentment and fuelling more terrorism. The victims, as always, would be the innocent civilians: the hundreds of thousands of men and women and particularly the children who have already suffered years of oppression, hardship and sanctions which have put them under the complete control of Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">There is already a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and now the people are being threatened again. Britain has already announced the deployment of some 30,000 troops and the United States 130,000 troops which are being mobilised in readiness to attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposition to this war is growing with every day that passes by groups of people of all ages, from all walks of life, and on 15 February 2003 there are going to be peace demonstrations right around the world. Those of us elected by the people in Europe can speak in this Parliament on behalf of so many of them who are saying no to war. I have received many letters from Wales and from other countries asking the European Parliament to do everything that it can to try and stop this war. Peaceful means of solving the problems have not been properly explored, let alone exhausted. It is tragic that if a fraction of the effort made by the United States and the United Kingdom to kindle their support for war had been put into bringing peace in the Middle East, we would live in a much safer and more peaceful world.</p>

Diplomacy should have led us in Europe to formulate joint or, at least, homogeneous positions. I therefore regret that, instead of working towards a European position or, at least, mediation through a Council meeting, we have split up and established unilateral parameters and positions which do nothing to further either the cause of peace or the development of a common foreign policy, and a common foreign policy is one of the goals towards which the Convention is working. The United States is not the only guardian of peace and justice, nor is it the only country qualified to declare war should that prove to be necessary and unavoidable in the interests of the common good. The contrasting statements which have been made in recent days promote the cause of the dictator, Saddam Hussein, rather than the development of what is a problematic peace process. I therefore, Mr President, call upon the Council, working together with the other European institutions, to concentrate on creating a climate of more serene cooperation between the countries of the Union, so that we can unite in an agreement and address the increasingly serious problems before us every day together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Berlusconi for the mediation initiative he has undertaken in the last few hours and I hope that everyone will work for peace, just as we must all strive to combat terrorism and dictatorships, even if that means declaring war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not, however, believe for one moment that a war is the correct solution to the problem. President Bush believes in absolute good and absolute evil. I, for my part, do not. I am convinced, rather, that Mr Bush’s, Mr Cheney’s and Mrs Condoleezza Rice’s interests in the oil industry are significantly greater than their concern for the well-being of the Iraqi people. Nor do I entertain any doubts that a war would be a unique opportunity to test approximately 20 new weapons systems, as well as being good for the American arms industry. Of course Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions. So must Israel too, moreover, and I anxiously await the relevant demands on the part of the United States and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">All methods other than war must be tried and, if war is unavoidable, it must be backed up by the UN and supported by powerful forces in Iraq itself. Let us not forget that the United States was once an enthusiastic supporter of Saddam Hussein and supplied him with some of his conventional weapons. Iraq does not constitute any immediate threat, either to its neighbours or to the global community. A war, on the other hand, could have completely unpredictable consequences. It would fuel increased hatred towards the United States and the West and create a breeding ground for further terrorism. There has been no success in improving the lives of the Afghan people, and there would scarcely be any success, either, in improving the lot of the Iraqis. The same applies to the sanctions against Iraq, which have merely made it easier for Saddam to oppress his people.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when people’s education is largely left to mullahs and the indoctrination they practise, what, I wonder, would happen if the United States were to use only 10% of the money expected to be spent on the war on providing the Arab world with, for example, free schools? That would be a far-sighted and long-term solution. War would be a short-sighted and anything but long-term solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can you see anyone saying ‘Yes to war’? Everyone – the Pope, the antipope, the communists, the fascists, everyone – is saying ‘No to war’. What is the alternative to ‘No to war’, however? Specifically, it is the risk of war breaking out – which you have mentioned<span class="bold"> </span>– in 15, 20 or 30 days’ time. What a wonderful success for the European Union: it would appear that the European Union has, at last, achieved agreement on a practical matter, if I am not mistaken, in calling for the inspectors to be given a few more weeks, for them to be given a little more time, a little more money, resources and a little more support. Later on, however, after 20 days, will there be a different strategy? What will Europe propose? The alternative to the destruction we call war – how do we, how do you see it? There is an alternative, and it is not peace: peace is what we have at the moment. For the time being, we are not at war, as you say, as my friend, Mr Le Pen, says, for whom the value of freedom and the value of fundamental human rights do not exist. That is his opinion! We all know the sorts of things that Mr Le Pen can say and the meanings that can be inferred. You can all go together: Mr Le Pen went to visit Saddam Hussein 12, 13 or 14 years ago with Mr Fini; now you can all go together. I can see some logic in all this.</p>
<p class="contents">We radicals have presented a proposal. In the space of four days, we have received approval from 66 countries. In Italy, to date, we have received approval from 57 Members of Parliament, half of them centre-left and half of them centre-right, including the former Prime Minister, Mr Andreotti, and other important figures who support this proposal. What are we suggesting? What proposal are we now submitting to you too? The alternative is called ‘democracy’, the alternative is called ‘law’ and ‘rights’, the alternative consists of enforcing written international law at last – for, although it is in force, it is not being enforced, as often happens in our country – that international law which, all things considered, has now identified a kind of subjective right to freedom and democracy belonging to the people living in this country, and by ‘this country’ we mean the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the chance to choose what the European Union wants, to choose whether it wants war or not, whether it wants Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq – for, whatever Mr Watson may say, he will leave accompanied, he will essentially have safe conduct as far as his place of exile, and, moreover, I would advise Mr Watson to read the Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, from which he will learn that, in any case, Saddam Hussein cannot be prosecuted in this situation – but what we can and must do is realise that the UN and the Security Council have a duty to act. It is not a question of changing the dictator but of changing the regime. That is what is needed in this part of the world, where the gun held to Saddam Hussein’s temple, for better or worse, now gives him the chance to make a limited choice between falling in a <span class="italic">coup</span> currently being plotted by his closest friends, shooting himself, committing suicide in a bunker, dying in a massacre or leaving the country, as many dictators have done, and being taken to live in exile somewhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our proposal, the alternative to war, as I have told Mr Cohn-Bendit too, and, more specifically: ‘temporary government’ – in inverted commas – by the UN for two or three years until fundamental rights are established in that country – using Amartya Sen’s economics and other methods; there have been temporary governments in Japan, Germany and other places – governments with the task of restoring to the Iraqi citizens and the Middle East the rights which have been taken from them through violence. This is our proposal, and may<span class="bold"> </span>the others rest in eternal peace.

But we naturally hope for more and we therefore ask that work continue in order to achieve a fundamental consensus between the European Union’s current four representatives on the United Nations Security Council, in the hope that the four will act, at least, in a coordinated fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that that consensus demands at least two things: the first is not to publicise unilateral positions but to debate them with our partners and the second is to be loyal – but not copycats – to our natural allies. Because although it seems obvious, we must remember that in this conflict the person who is threatening world peace, failing to comply with international law and presenting us with the real risk that international terrorists may acquire chemical and bacteriological weapons is Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">And it does not take any great feat of memory to conclude that the only language the Iraqi Government understands from the international community is firmness. And this firmness is not credible if we say beforehand that in no event, whatever happens, can the use of force be justified, as the President of my group quite rightly said. This is not pacifism, it is demagoguery and irresponsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to genuinely work for peace, what we have to do is act decisively against violations of international law and against repeated non-compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the European Union should continue to explore all political and diplomatic avenues in order to resolve the conflict in a peaceful manner, with our allies, as is natural, and also, and in particular, with our friends, the Arab nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you of the unanimous support of the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council for Resolution 1441, because this is not a religious conflict or a conflict between civilisations – incidentally, it would be good to take this opportunity to relaunch Euro-Mediterranean relations. In order to be credible, the European Union must be prepared to make its contribution to guaranteeing and preserving international peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">The inspectors’ reports to the Security Council are conclusive in terms of the non-compliance with Resolution 1441. They are not being given the required assistance to carry out their work and they are not being given the evidence to show that weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated, and the simple fact that terrorist groups may acquire these weapons should be cause for alarm on the part of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iraqi regime today has a new opportunity; let us pray that it takes that opportunity and that we can all prevent anything worse from happening. But if the Iraqi Government persists in ignoring the requirements demanded of it, not for just a month or two, but since April 1991, when Resolution 687 was adopted, democratic parliaments such as the European Parliament must demand of the executive powers that they meet their responsibilities. Democratic and responsible governments must not make decisions on the basis of opinion polls, which are variable, but by informing the public, engaging in political debate but defending the higher principles at stake, such as international peace and security, not the price of oil. And periodically, by means of democratic elections, the citizens will judge whether the governments, and also the oppositions, have made the right decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have not yet seen any convincing evidence. They are concerned about the human suffering, the increasing South-North divide that will increase hatred amongst people and hinder democratisation and solutions in the Middle East. The fear is that fundamentalists of all hues will use and abuse the opportunity to determine our world agenda, which will result in the opposite of world peace, stability and justice. In a world in which oil prices are rising and the chance of peace is falling, it is the developing countries with no oil that are the main victims. The gap will grow. The international coalition against international terrorism is being undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Whoever tries to oust Saddam through war without convincing evidence, without a UN resolution and therefore without public opinion on their side, is undermining the international rule of law. Europeans are not at all convinced. That is why the European members of the UN Security Council must exert maximum pressure on Saddam to answer Blix’s questions without making the mistake of falling into an unregulated and improper war. Germany, Britain, France and Spain must all listen to their people and not to the fundamentalist Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz in George Bush’s circle. There have fortunately been many protests from the American people, and a large number of Democrats have rejected the logic of inevitable war. We are looking for allies among the American people, the majority of whom are not in favour of a unilateral war.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject the logic of inevitable war. The dictator Saddam must fear the wrath of the whole world, but this must be aimed at allowing him to cooperate peacefully in finding answers and not in another Bay of Pigs or another Tonkin incident. And if Bush ultimately comes up with the evidence which he has been repeatedly promising us and which Blix has also urgently requested, that is not a reason for war but, on the contrary, to inspect through the UN and then to tackle and eliminate the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The power of a united Security Council must bring Saddam to his knees, and we must take time to do that. We have the time, Saddam does not. A war without convincing evidence or a UN resolution would be an admission of weakness and would really play into the hands of the Saddams of this world.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us Europeans, via you, Mr Solana, the 15 Member States and the Security Council, build on our European peoples’ desire for peace. That is true wisdom.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicholson of Winterbourne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, resolution 1441 is very clear. It declares in paragraph 1 that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under the relevant resolutions including resolution 687 of 1991. Resolution 687 of 1991 details the United Nations' demands of international monitoring, inspection and verification of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. It imposes sanctions, except as regards medical and humanitarian supplies, to ensure compliance. It places a clear prohibition on the commission of, or support for, acts of terrorism. It demands the restoration of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property and it warns of grave consequences which would follow Iraq's continued use of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq is indeed guilty and in breach on all those counts. For example, it supports terrorists such as the MKO (Mujahedin-e Khalq Organisation), proscribed on the European Union list of terrorists. It trains, arms and sends out that terrorist group and has done so for a long time now. Possibly also, through war in the north of Iraq, we are discovering its links with the Al Qaida network of international terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to weapons of mass destruction. I have talked in earlier debates of the use of mustard gas in the marshes in 1996 and of the victims I saw. Mr Brok, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, mentioned our mission to Iran, during which we talked to a few of the tragic people who had suffered the consequences of that misuse of weapons of mass destruction, with Kuwaiti prisoners of war still being hidden and property still not returned. Despite these breaches, resolution 1441 gives Iraq one final chance, a slender window of opportunity that it seems to be refusing to open.</p>
<p class="contents">Resolution 1441 calls us also to witness and to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people. The resolution points to the prolongation of the crisis of humanitarian dimensions as the consequence of Iraq's refusal to implement resolution 687 and others. What are the consequences? Millions of refugees. Iran has borne a major burden, Jordan has large numbers, Syria enormous numbers too and Turkey also, not to mention other countries in the region. We have a relatively small number in the European Union. Hundreds of thousands, yes, but not the four and a half million that are in the region. These refugees are alive; others have been tortured, killed or imprisoned and have no freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Saddam is indeed dangerous to the region and beyond, and dangerous to his own people. If he retains his power, we cannot be sure in the future that he will not once more go back to spending three-quarters of his gross national product on weapons, 15, 16, 17 billion dollars' worth of new weapons in the region year on year. That is the threat he poses to the region, and he has instruments which will allow him to put those weapons of mass destruction beyond Iraq's national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Resolution 687 had an overall objective of restoring international peace and security in the region. I believe that the United Nations' will is now to secure that goal. Our unity as a European Union should be deployed in support of their efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem is that the decision to bomb Iraq into a morgue unfit for the dead was taken a long time ago on the Potomac. People all over the world have understood this and are angry and are mobilising against it. It is all very well to say that we must announce the role of the United Nations. But, may I ask, who is demeaning that role and proclaiming every day that, with or without the United Nations, war will be unleashed, probably by 6 March 2003, whatever the Security Council may or may not say?</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding solid evidence, we do not know for sure if this bloody dictator still has these awful weapons and neither does Dr Blix. What the United States is asking from Saddam Hussein, however, is not to prove his innocence but to provide evidence of his own guilt, that is, to put his own neck in the noose to be hanged or be bombed to smithereens. If this were a criminal case, it would be thrown out of any court in this world. So, to adapt the words of Mr Solana and Mr Patten, there is quite a lot of ambiguity, obfuscation and the undeclared will to follow the warmongering lead of Washington, hoping only that the United Nations will provide the desired fig leaf. This, we must say, probably for the last time, is a defining moment for Europe. This Union must reclaim the moral and rational initiative and, first of all, save itself from some of its leaders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that we will vote tomorrow on a joint resolution tabled by several political groups, as well as on a number of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to repeat that, in fact, in listening to you, in listening to my fellow Members, I think that one of the starting points of our thinking is the will, which has been widely confirmed by many of our citizens, to reject military intervention, whether or not it is supported by a United Nations resolution, incidentally. I believe we must ask ourselves the searching question: why, in the fifteen countries of the Union, are we seeing such a vehement rejection of war?</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons have already been partly cited. First of all, there are no determining facts to explain why Iraq might be more dangerous today than two years ago. I am nevertheless surprised that Mr Bush suddenly decided that 5 February will be the date on which he will be able to provide proof that he has probably possessed for a long time. Next, and without wishing to be anti-American, I think that the people of Europe vaguely dislike a single government deciding the priorities of the international calendar, however powerful this government considers itself to be. It is clearly because of that, and we agree, that we would like to see increased power for the United Nations and for the European Union as a world player, but also to set another agenda. In this regard, I believe the president of my group, Mr Cohn-Bendit, spoke brilliantly; I think he is right: we need to defend other priorities. Naturally, it is easier said than done and it depends a great deal on the Arab, Persian and Turkish societies in the region. We also have our share of responsibility, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to return to the matter of the embargo to conclude. The embargo is helping the dictatorship. It is killing the Iraqi people. I believe we should, and you are probably doing this, inform the Iraqi opposition by all possible and imaginable means that, of course, Saddam Hussein must respond to the questions of the UN inspectors, but that if changes were to take place in Iraq, we could help them by lifting the embargo, solely, of course, on non-military goods. I believe this message must be stated more firmly and should be conveyed through the appropriate diplomatic channels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world, and making their voice heard, consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no justification for this war in my opinion or in the opinion of the protestors. I repeat yet again that there is no evidence whatsoever of a link between Al Qaida and Iraq. Washington's claims are based on Al Qaida prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. We all know what those prisoners are suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">There was never for one moment any doubt in my mind that the United States has been angling for war in Iraq. The fact that 1.7 million citizens have died as a result of sanctions and bombings since the Gulf War makes one wonder how much a barrel of oil is worth. Make no mistake, this war is about oil. We are told by the United States that the oil reserves after the war will be used exclusively for Iraqi reconstruction. I say to Mr Bush: pull my other leg! Just look at the United States' contributions to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The European Union is footing that particular bill. Society in Afghanistan remains as fractured as ever. In my view, the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. Without the agreement of the UN Security Council, this war would be a breach of international law, would have no legitimacy and would be wholly immoral.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 80% of European people are against war in Iraq. Yet they are ignored by American and British leaders who are busy sending troops in preparation for the war. So much for democracy. I believe that, after Iraq, the Americans will move on to Iran and the other elements of the axis of evil. Truly a war of civilisations. May God helps us all!</p>

It is no surprise that the United States have what could be called a need for war, simply because empires can only live through and in a state of war. Nor is it surprising that they need to invent pretexts. Nor is it surprising that Europe, in the face of this, is ludicrously divided. Nor is it surprising that France, in Europe and throughout the world, symbolises resistance to imperial terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we are well aware that this empire needs wars, just like any other empire since the beginning of time: war in Kosovo in 1999, in Afghanistan in 2001, in Iraq today and soon, perhaps, also in Côte-d'Ivoire – where this would supposedly be to defend the country against France. It needs wars for various reasons, for oil, naturally, since oil is so very necessary to Bush’s oil consortium, but also for economic reasons. The American economy, as we are forever being told, is on hold and this situation is decidedly bad for growth. In this cruel system, the boost to the economy comes at the price of several hundred thousand deaths. Once again, nothing surprises us any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we be surprised at Washington’s pathetic need to disguise its crimes. What is surprising, however, is that we still take them seriously. The argument concerning weapons of mass destruction, for which we have not the slightest proof, is no longer valid, and has not been valid for a long time in the eyes of public opinion in the greater part of the world. Lest we be accused of anti-Americanism, I would recall what was written by Scott Ritter, an American citizen and member of the first inspection mission halted in 1998 by a first, or second, or third American war. He wrote quite simply that Saddam Hussein cannot have kept the slightest usable chemical weapons programme after the first inspection mission.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time to explore the other points, but it is also unsurprising that Europe is divided. Some Member States feel more like members of the federation of the United States than of the European Union. One example of which, but not the only one, is the United Kingdom, the reason for whose membership of the European Union is hard to fathom. Then there are others who, like France, retain the idea of a world organised into nations. It is not surprising that France should remain the symbol of resistance to imperial violence: this is its age-old vocation and the vast majority of its people today strongly support the President of the Republic in carrying out this age-old duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For now, however, the observation that we must make following the inspectors’ report is that Iraq has not clearly refused to implement resolution 1441. Without any genuinely new information, and we shall see whether the US Secretary of State is able to provide any, nothing therefore currently justifies the Security Council adopting a new resolution authorising the instigation of military operations against Baghdad. In order to be able to justify the international community’s move to the second phase of action, the elements of proof would have to be equal to the seriousness of the accusations. Until now, however, no proof has been provided, whereas substantial grey areas remain.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the instigation of a war, bypassing the Security Council, against a State that now appears to comply with the decisions of the international community would undoubtedly have effects contrary to those desired. By placing Saddam Hussein in the paradoxical position of persecuted innocent in the eyes of developing world opinion, he would inevitably relaunch the very Islamic terrorism that we have undertaken to eradicate. In the current conditions, Mr President, the cure would therefore be worse than the disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are forced to note, however, that, with regard to Iraq, voices are currently divided between those who are opposed to any kind of military action or threat; those who, alongside the Americans, seem determined to take military action in the next few days and those, myself included, who are a majority within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who ask that we only resort to war when we have exhausted all diplomatic means of persuading Saddam Hussein to give in and of forcing him to abandon all his projects for the development and production of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">To all those who reject any idea of military action, to those who say ‘never again’ to war, I would like to say that I respect the generosity of their commitment, even though I do not share their angelic vision of a world entirely without weapons, where universal peace could be established, where all violence could cease for moral reasons, and not simply because of a fear of retribution. I would like to remind all those people of the unfortunate experience of Kosovo, where Europe was unable to oblige Milosevic to end his ethnic cleansing policy because that dictator, who had always known how far he could go before going too far, did not believe in the political will of the European Union or in its ability to implement it within the alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are all in agreement in condemning Saddam Hussein, not only for the risk he represents in relation to international terrorism in the production and distribution of weapons of mass destruction, but also because of the cruelty of the regime he imposes on his people. We believe, together with the United Nations Security Council, that he should realise that he can no longer prevaricate and that he must now, in the next few days, provide proof that he is resigned to disarming and has resolved to do so, or he will have to face a war which he has no chance of winning.</p>
<p class="contents">To those of my fellow Members who are determined to go to Iraq to send a different message and ensure that there will never be a war, I would therefore say here, rather solemnly: take care that you yourselves, in encouraging him in his extremism, are not responsible for the fact that the international community might have no other option than the use of weapons to impose the implementation of the will it has been stating for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now turn to all those who think that all the elements are present to authorise the immediate deployment of armed intervention, with no need for a new United Nations Security Council resolution and I would say to them: public opinion does not agree with you on this point since it is demanding proof that this action is unavoidable and a guarantee that it will be carried out in compliance with and in defence of international law. Colin Powell must provide this proof to the Security Council and a delegation from Parliament must go to New York on Monday to give the matter the serious consideration it deserves. If this proof is provided, I have no doubt that the United Nations Security Council will not fail to draw the appropriate conclusions. If the proof, however, is not yet sufficient, then the United Nations inspection mission must be given the time it requests to try, again, to avoid a war. That is the essence of the proposal for a resolution by our political group and the joint resolution that will be presented tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand, however, after what I have just said, that we must not in any way give the impression that we are excluding the possibility of military action. That would be totally counter-productive and that is why we have tabled several amendments to the draft joint resolution, the most important of which concerns the current wording of Article 3, which some people could interpret that way. As I believe, together with the majority of my fellow Members, in the importance of this joint resolution, which must show the world that, at least within the European Parliament, the voices of Europe are in harmony, I sincerely hope that, taking account of the amendments we are proposing, this resolution will be able to win over the votes of as broad a majority as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a possible compromise, but I believe it to be inadequate. The doctrine of a preventive war to protect the vital interests of the United States is unacceptable. The Pope has said this and felt obliged to condemn such a doctrine because it contravenes international law and the United Nations Charter. This doctrine should, therefore, be expressly criticised and rejected by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the ‘erratic’ policy of the Bush administration – as Bill Clinton called it, and erratic is the least that can be said about it – conceals the monstrous concerns of a new strategy to control oil in the Middle East and has provided cover for the real and unacceptable State terrorism taking place; the terrorism perpetrated by the government of Ariel Sharon. I am saying this on the day following Ariel Sharon’s victory in the Israeli elections, which will, in my opinion, have tragic consequences for Israel. I very much hope that I am mistaken, because I consider myself to be a friend of the Israeli people.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday’s speech by George Bush was once again extremely arrogant and without any real foundation. He clearly wants war at any cost, for reasons of his own and to protect the interests of the United States. The existence of weapons of mass destruction, an accusation that President Bush is levelling – so far without any convincing evidence – at the dictator and murderer Saddam Hussein seems simply to be a pretext, ignoring Kim Jong-Il, the Korean dictator – who does indeed have atomic weapons – and all the other dictators in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by praising the courage and political clear-mindedness of the French and German Governments for having condemned war against Iraq without the express authorisation of the United Nations. We, and I, as a Member of the European Parliament, are proud of the ‘old’ Europe. All the European governments, in my opinion, especially those of the Fifteen, should uphold this position. Telling the truth is the best way of demonstrating our friendship and respect towards the United States of America; the America of the pioneer spirit and of idealism, not the America of self-interest and dirty deals.</p>

The European Union’s famous common position is basically a manifesto for war; that much is clear from the fact that Blair has signed it.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union were against war with Iraq, it would exercise its veto in the Security Council. Its Member States would not be sending frigates to the Gulf and would not be accommodating US demands. They would be abiding by the principle of the UN, which precludes military action except in self-defence, which does not apply here. The European Union is therefore merely stalling for time so that it can finish haggling with the USA for control of Iraq’s oil fields. This is what this is really about, if the truth be told. If Iraq had no black gold, frankly no one would give a damn. Its supposed weapons of mass destruction are just a pretext. There are countries in the world, such as India, Pakistan and Israel, that possess weapons of mass destruction, and there are countries, like the USA, that produce and sell and use them.</p>
<p class="contents">We Communists have no time for Saddam Hussein’s bloody dictatorship. We have a score to settle with him because our thousands of Iraqi comrades were his first victims. However, whether or not he should remain in power is a question only the Iraqi people can answer and it is our duty to offer them active political solidarity. Just as in the last war and during the embargo on Iraq, this war will have disastrous consequences for the long-suffering Iraqi people. And as things now stand, it will have dramatic consequences – including economic consequences – closer to home. What we must call for, therefore, is for this criminal war to be averted at all costs, with or without a UN resolution. Yes to the peaceful resolution of international problems. No to any move to accommodate the sabre-rattling president of the United States acting as the mouthpiece of multinational interests. We must express our solidarity with the American people, more and more of whom are raising their voices in protest against this war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He asked us to travel to Iraq to support the weapons inspections. He believed that would show not only the USA and the world at large, but also Iraq, that the weapons inspections are not something thought up by the USA, but the only way to achieve peace; and it would show that the weapons inspectors have strong support, even among us pacifists and opponents of war.</p>
<p class="contents">At a video conference yesterday with the chairmen of the political groups, Hans Blix confirmed that he too believes that there is something to be gained from Members of the European Parliament travelling to Iraq and clearly expressing their support for weapons inspections to the Iraqi leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, it is very sad to listen to attempts by the Liberals to malign and cast suspicion on the 30 or so Members of the European Parliament who have decided to travel to Iraq with a view to promoting peace. It is easy to sit in safety back home in Europe and pour scorn on those of us who, out of desperation in the face of the risk of a large-scale war, are trying to make at least a small contribution. I think that is very sad. We are <span class="italic">for</span> peace because we are <span class="italic">against</span> the use of the death penalty. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a gangster, but if we are to have an international legal system, he must not be lynched, and we should not impose a collective death penalty, which hits innocent people. Within the EU, we do not permit the death penalty for individuals even in the case of the worst of criminals. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to have an international legal system and not revert to a cross between the Middle Ages and the Wild West. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sad and concerned to see the United States now taking a path which is likely to lose it the moral leadership of the world, although it will, of course, still have political and military leadership. Indeed, we have shifted from a firm, rational position in the face of the dangers of Arab and Islamic terrorism and the terrorism of Iraq itself to a situation of unilateral decisions, and we must realise that we cannot accept this situation without undoing decades of progress made in international law. What will we do if, in the future, a country such as China or Russia decides it has the right to invade one of its neighbours? Is Iraq really the most dangerous threat or is Korea not evidence of the existence of greater threats? That is why, while confirming our great affection and esteem for the United States, we must now tell it, as its true allies and friends, that it has taken the wrong road and must stop and listen to the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, my regret is increased by the state of Europe, at the sight of a Europe divided as never before, in which the genuine problems – the lack of a political, strategic vision of the world – are starkly revealed and in which the legitimate, rightful diversities of the European countries are made worthless by their inability to agree on joint measures. I welcome the Franco-German cooperation, although I do not support all the positions. I welcome it because it has always been the driving force of Europe and can continue to be so in the future, but, if we do not want it to be restricted to what is quite simply irrelevant rhetoric, as has been the case thus far, it must be channelled into a position which will result in the creation of a European defence policy in the future, for only when Europe speaks with one voice will it become as influential as the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The starting point in this whole debate must be that we are representatives of democratic nations. Saddam Hussein is a dictator who has no respect for democracy, for the rule of law or for the demands of the United Nations itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As democrats we have a responsibility to explain fully the reasons why it may be necessary to take action in order to uphold the will of the international community, which is that Saddam Hussein should unconditionally disarm.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is not simply about the work of UN inspectors; rather, it is about disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction. These weapons were there when the inspectors had to leave in 1999 – where are they now? There has to date been no evidence of disarmament; and let us never forget: the burden of proof here must be with Saddam. In my view, the British Prime Minister has a special responsibility to explain clearly the reasons why we must confront the threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Sadly I must say that, to date, his own government has not been as united and clear on this issue as I feel we in the United Kingdom are entitled to expect.</p>
<p class="contents">We are disappointed at Mr Blair's inability to sufficiently persuade public opinion in the United Kingdom of the need to be prepared to take action, in the face of what is very clearly a real threat to the security of our people. In the United Kingdom we have seen during the course of the last fortnight or so very clear instances of the existence of that real threat. A collective failure to confront the gravity of the situation with unity and with determination only gives Saddam Hussein succour; not to be prepared to take action – if he continues to obstruct and to lie – would be an open invitation to any rogue state to do anything it likes and still not face serious consequences. It would also leave the United States itself, and the United Nations particularly, weak and impotent.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, should the situation not improve in the weeks ahead, a second UN resolution may be required. That is, however, the optimum option ahead of any military engagement in the Gulf. Having listened to General Morillon, I take the view that the international Community still has the right to act without any such new resolution, as the powers are already vested in earlier UN resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the French and German Governments in recent days, as well as many of the contributions and demonstrations that have been made in this Chamber this afternoon, clearly show that any prospect of a common foreign and security policy is fallacious. I do not make any partisan political point on this, but we are surely fooling ourselves as European Parliamentarians if we believe that we are anywhere near developing a common foreign and security policy or anything like it – we clearly are not.</p>
<p class="contents">In the days and weeks ahead, we need steady nerves and an effective United Nations. We must ensure Saddam Hussein understands that his failure to comply with the will of the international community will result in serious consequences. Equally, we must also ensure that public opinion in the West and elsewhere understands and appreciates why we must be prepared to take action in defence of the international interest. Political leaders must have the courage to face up to such threats; otherwise the credibility of the United Nations itself will be at stake and Saddam Hussein will have prevailed.</p>
<p class="contents">If the western nations had sent a stronger and more unified message to Saddam Hussein from the start and maintained their resolve, then perhaps we would not have to be contemplating military intervention today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the United States of America is a democratic country which twice in the last century was prepared to lay down the lives of its citizens to defend peace, freedom and democracy in Europe. Iraq is a country ruled by a dictatorship, where there is neither freedom nor democracy, and whose leaders murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens and is known to be a threat to peace and stability in the region. It is not the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth remembering exactly what resolution 1441 actually says. Paragraph 1 states that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations under UN resolutions. Paragraph 4 states that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations. Finally, Paragraph 13 recalls that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. Given Hans Blix's report, it could be argued that Paragraph 4 has already been breached. Whatever is the case, the UN has to decide what it means by Paragraph 13 and by serious consequences. Colleagues who have spoken are right that the future of the UN is at stake. The UN cannot make threats without being prepared to carry them out.</p>
<p class="contents">The inspectors need more time and we need more information from the Americans. But if further serious breaches are reported, resolution 1441 has to be followed through. Failure to do so will only sanction the very illegal activity we have condemned, and it seems to me that some of the contributions today are attacks on UN resolution 1441 which we are all supporting. No member of the Security Council should prejudge that debate; nor should they say now how they are going to vote before they see the evidence. But we must be clear that, if a second resolution is forthcoming from the UN, we must all support it because that is what we have stated very clearly in our resolutions in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Not content to allow the Palestinian people to be massacred, to allow 500 000 Iraqi children to die due to the embargo and millions of Africans with AIDS to die due to lack of care, President Bush is going to invade Iraq in order, in particular, to appropriate its oil. Who can seriously believe for one second that the United States want to oppose a terrorist dictatorship because it fails to respect UN decisions? We should not forget that Pinochet and Bin Laden were agents recruited and trained by the CIA, that Israel has never applied a single UN resolution and that fortunately, however, nobody is considering bombing Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights or profits: two weights, two measures. That is the choice. This war smells of oil, and the majority in this House knows it. Without providing any support for Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, it is our duty to pass on the mass rejection of the people which will be expressed in particular in all the capital cities on 15 February in response to the Porto Alegre forum. With or without the UN, this war is not ours. According to estimates, it will cost almost USD 30 billion, while the UN food programme, under pressure from the United States, has just been reduced to USD 1.7 billion. Rejecting the war by every possible means, using the sums allocated to war to eradicate poverty, and allowing the Palestinian people to live in a free State: those are the three imperatives of the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is vitally important that the European Parliament sends a very clear message that there is no case for military action in Iraq. Increasing numbers of people across the EU recognise that such a pre-emptive attack would be both illegal and immoral. Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for anti-war demonstrations across the European Union. In the United Kingdom, over 160 000 people have signed a petition against war organised by a national newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. They recognise that you cannot say you are upholding international law by breaking international law. They know that a war against Iraq would also be hugely counter-productive – far from fighting terrorism, it is a sure-fire way to fuel terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">There are alternatives and the EU has a key role to play in promoting them. If this conflict is really about getting rid of weapons of mass destruction, there are many other routes we can take. We need full implementation, for example, of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Five countries, including Britain, France and the United States, have been in material breach of this particular article of international law for over three decades. The chemical and biological conventions could also be strengthened. There are many other proposals. There are ambitious and controversial agendas, but the EU is uniquely able to propose radical new solutions and it has a duty to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tajani (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, we are all agreed that every endeavour must be made to safeguard peace and that it is the duty of all of us to strive to avoid war. I share the anti-war sentiments, but it is precisely in order to avoid war that the international community must identify with the United Nations Organisation and its decisions, thus giving authority to the role of the United Nations. The decisions taken by the UN thus far have been very clear, Mr President, starting with the message sent to Saddam Hussein calling for the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. If Iraq does not respect the wishes of the international community, an armed intervention, which, of course, may only follow a UN decision, will be inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the ball is in the Iraqi dictator’s court. It is now up to Saddam Hussein to prove to the world that he does not have prohibited weapons. If he genuinely wants to prevent war, he must tell the inspectors the truth. I regret to say that, thus far, Saddam Hussein has been uncooperative towards the UN representatives, as is shown by Hans Blix’s report to the Security Council which expresses clear suspicions regarding nerve gas and chemical bombs. I quote: ‘On 7th of December, 2002, Iraq submitted a declaration of some 12,000 pages … [to] … the Security Council. … Regrettably, the 12 000-page declaration, most of which is a reprint of earlier documents, does not seem to contain any new evidence that will eliminate the questions or reduce their number.’ The same applies to nerve gas. Iraq promised that the poisonous substance had not been deployed for use as a weapon, yet UNMOVIC has managed to obtain information to the contrary: there are indications that Iraq has produced more than it declared and that nerve gas has been deployed for military purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I will cite once again the report submitted to the Security Council in relation to chemical bombs: there is a discrepancy of 6 500 bombs. I repeat: 6 500 chemical bombs remain unaccounted for. Then Iraq has declared that it produced about 8 500 litres of anthrax, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991. Iraq – the report continues – has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction. There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared. The report continues in this vein.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I am pleased to say, Saddam Hussein is isolated. In addition to this, the statement made by Mr Putin yesterday calling upon the Iraqi dictator to cooperate with the inspectors, failing which Russia would be forced to change its position, must not be underestimated. The pressure on Saddam Hussein must be intensified. I am therefore appealing to the Members of the European Parliament who are thinking of going to Iraq to give up their plan. Saddam Hussein would use their mission to claim that Europe is divided and that he has some supporters in our continent. This exploitation must be avoided at all costs. Whether we choose war or peace now depends first and foremost on the decisions Saddam Hussein makes, and Europe must ensure that the Iraqi regime cooperates with the inspectors. In this extremely problematic situation, Europe’s duty is to use its influence to further peace. The Union’s document, approved by the Foreign Affairs Ministers the other day, is evidence that divisions can be avoided in our continent, divisions which Saddam Hussein could exploit to gain time and to create further setbacks for the United Nations. By speaking with one voice, Europe has persuaded the United States to accept the postponement of war and has given the inspectors more influence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Old Continent can do a great deal to achieve peace, and this is why the initiatives being taken by the Italian Government at this time deserve our close attention and support too. The interviews and meetings – held today, tomorrow and on Monday – could prove to be extremely significant, not least in that I believe the Italian Government is conveying messages from the other countries of the European Union. The active quest for peace must not, however, Mr President, cause us to forget that we are all committed to safeguarding the values of freedom, tolerance and respect for human dignity, values which suffered attack on September 11. It is not just the United States which suffered – each one of us has been affected. Now, it is up to Saddam Hussein to prove that he is not supporting terrorism, that he has no dealings with Al Qaida and that he intends to bow to the will of the United Nations. In short, it is he who will be responsible for what happens in the coming months.</p>

All credit is due to him, but we must also acknowledge the work of the Greek Presidency, which played this card determinedly and, thus far, has obtained hitherto unhoped-for results, especially as regards the agenda and the time frames. In this connection, I would remind you that Korea, the Middle East and Macedonia were discussed as well as Iraq, for they are all part of a very complex international situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament will have no difficulty in supporting you, Mr Solana, on the four points you cited as European strategy. I would make it clear that, as regards the role of the United Nations, we – the Group of the European Socialists, in particular – want there to be neither excessive rigidity in the implementation of Resolution 1441 nor, should there prove to be a discrepancy between statements and reality, an automatic declaration of war. However, to lend credibility to the desire – which you have rightly described as the desire of the majority of the European citizens – to both avoid war and be without dictators, I believe that Europe must have more confidence in itself and be more coherent and, above all, more united. More coherent in the sense of believing more strongly in its values and showing some pride in them and more united in the sense of adopting a better thought out, consistent position.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to end with a question. Are this document, adopted on 27 January by the Foreign Affairs Ministers, and the coordination of the European Members of the Security Council an indication that the opposing Franco-German and Anglo-Spanish positions will be resolved? Then, what will Italy – the subject of such eulogies from Mr Tajani – do when it has the Presidency? How much continuity can there be between the Greek and Italian Presidencies, given that our Prime Minister oscillates continuously between support for President Bush and what then appears to be a preference for the European position? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As emphasised by the representatives of many countries at the world parliamentary forum in Porto Alegre, we must call on our leaders to firmly oppose the war and reject the concept of preventive war contained in the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration. The institutions of the European Union, and the governments of the Member States and candidate countries must reject all and any participation in the war against Iraq, including the use of military bases and other facilities on their territory, and reject any participation of soldiers or the provision of military and financial resources, without this implying any support for the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that the embargo on Iraq is ended, an embargo that has caused so much harm to the population, particularly to children. What is particularly important are all actions demonstrating solidarity with the Iraqi people, such as visits to Iraq by delegations of Members of the European Parliament and the public demonstrations against the war and to defend peace planned for 15 February. We must reject this unjust war, which is clearly a statement of the United States’ hegemony, essentially dictated by oil interests and American and British military and industrial complexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposition to the war in Iraq is equally crucial in order to put an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and to the aggression by Ariel Sharon’s government and to attempt to achieve, by means of dialogue, a fair and lasting peace. Our citizens want peace, so let us all work to make this possible, repeatedly expressing our protests, indignation and rejection with regard to the imminence of a new war against Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Faced with this crisis, none of the European Union's Member States can remain indifferent, and it should not be necessary to remind you, in this context, that the source and origin of this crisis is to be found in Iraq and not in the USA. It is not through the USA's desire to unleash war on that part of the world that this crisis has come about, but because a despot remains in power in Iraq, and in possession of dangerous weapons of mass destruction, having already, in the past, demonstrated that he does not shrink from using them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruptions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are sufficient indications, my good sir, that Saddam Hussein is also pulling the strings of international terrorism and supplying it with funds. Nor do I see it as legitimate to speak in terms of the USA and the international community, which includes the European Union, applying double standards here. Double standards are not being applied, and asking where all the raids are to be carried out is actually out of order. Anyone approaching this issue with a serious mind knows that North Korea may well be very dangerous, but that it calls for responses that differ from those appropriate to Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that a serious discussion is the proper place for assertions that the USA has weapons of mass destruction at its disposal and demands that it should therefore disarm. Arguments of that sort are of no use to anyone except Saddam Hussein, whose aim is to split European and American public opinion in order to win time and secure his political survival.</p>
<p class="contents">If Saddam Hussein has nothing to hide, why then does he not put his cards on the table? Why does he not allow his scientists to give information without them having minders present? Let there be no doubt about it: the key to a peaceful solution to this crisis is in Saddam Hussein's hands, and he must cooperate in the manner specified by the chief weapons inspector, Dr Blix, when he addressed the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, too, the way in which the European Union handles this challenge will be crucial to the credibility of the plans for a common foreign and security policy, which are so much on our lips. There is no getting away from the need for us to speak as one on this issue. This applies not only to the Council's position on Iraq, but also, of course, to Parliament, and so I fully endorse the joint resolution that General Morillon has negotiated on behalf of our group.</p>
<p class="contents">We support every conceivable peaceful step towards disarming Iraq and getting it to cooperate. We see action by the UN as having priority, and regard Iraq's build-up of rockets as a de facto breach of the UN resolutions. We Austrians are concerned about the way Iraq is stockpiling such weapons as anthrax, and we therefore support all the political and diplomatic efforts at using channels that will bring a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we Austrians attach the highest importance to a peaceful way forward, we are of course well aware of the fact that, being a small country, we cannot, at the end of the day, prevent anyone from taking military action as a last resort to secure peace and international security. What that means for us in practical terms is that no Austrian troops will take part in hostilities, but that we will instead – in accordance with Austrian tradition – participate in maintaining peace. It means, moreover, that aircraft will not be able to overfly Austria when taking part in hostilities, but only when taking part in action specifically authorised by the Security Council, and that the bottom line is that Austria's land and air sovereignty must be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this sense that we have fully supported the content of the Greek Presidency's joint conclusions, and also Parliament's resolution, which we hope is the expression of a common mind, the only regrettable aspect of which is that it reflects the lowest common denominator. I also repudiate the tendency of several Members of this House to allow themselves to be used by Iraq as propaganda tools, which contrasts with Parliament's fact-finding mission to the UN in New York. This is an important instrument, and, if this delegation is equipped with a clear message to Saddam Hussein, it should be enabled to carry this message to Baghdad as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me start with a photograph that I have seen in the German press, and in the French press as well; it shows the American defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld in Baghdad, shaking hands with Saddam Hussein in a friendly way. The photograph was taken at a time when Mr Rumsfeld was President Reagan's special envoy for relations with the Middle East. Might it be the case that, at that time, Mr Rumsfeld discussed the supply of armaments?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruptions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me put another question. Why will the American administration provide evidence only after 5 February? If there were evidence that Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction, the United States of America would be under an obligation to produce such evidence at once and supply it to the weapons inspectors. Why only from 5 February onwards?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question is this. Mrs Stenzel said that the measures needed to deal with North Korea were different from those that are appropriate to Iraq. So let her tell us what they are! Here is one state, North Korea, which announces that it is building atomic weapons. So the United States of America says, ‘We shall negotiate with you.’ Another state apparently possesses weapons of mass destruction, and the response of the United States is to say, ‘We are not negotiating with them; we shall declare war.’ Where is the logic in that, if that is not purely arbitrary?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put my last question. Might it not be that the coalition against terrorism, so laboriously forged in the aftermath of 11 September, might be destroyed by a warlike act that had not been thought through beforehand? Might there not be heads of Muslim states, prepared to work together with the Western community of states, but who would not be able to remain in the anti-terror coalition if there were hostilities in Iraq? And might it not be the case that what is advocated by Mrs Stenzel and others – and obviously you, Mr Morillon, as well – might become the greatest campaign for recruiting terrorists that we have seen in recent years?</p>
<p class="contents">If you can answer all these questions in the negative, then you can count yourselves lucky. I fear that you will have to answer them with ‘yes’, and that is why my government is right to say that what this region needs is more peace, rather than war, of which it has already had enough.</p>

I find the behaviour of those veteran pacifists who claim to be anti-war on ideological grounds, setting themselves up as champions of peace, infantile, as if all the others were warmongers. We are all for peace, we are all against war, we are all against weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, how do the professional pacifists think the weapons of mass destruction can be destroyed if Saddam Hussein is not making the sites and stores known to the UN inspectors? It is irresponsible to make out that the world is divided into those who are for and those who are against peace. The civilised world, all civilised people, all people aware of their own dignity, are against war. That is why I am asking you all not to draw a line through Parliament, for the distinction would, in this case, be purely for manipulative ends.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of those who consider that the role of the UN must be strengthened and that international policing measures must be decided by the United Nations, despite the need for far-reaching UN reform. However, I am also convinced that we must leave behind the Yalta approach once and for all and that debates on the dangerous situations threatening the world must include all the States which have a significant role to play in the world. We can show our gratitude towards the US in many ways, just as the US can show its support for Europe by not exporting egotistical, blinkered economic short-sightedness. It is in the common interest, the interest of both Europe and the United States, to have the closest possible relationship with Russia. It was a wise move to include it in the Nato Council, and we must continue this forward-looking process and involve Russia in world decision-making. This is important for European integration, which must continue with the entry of the Balkans into the Union one by one and the evaluation of all the other accession applications.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate that the Arab League’s decision to approve the UN resolution is significant, just as it is important for States governing Muslim peoples to approve it, for we need to isolate the fundamentalists, the extremists, the totalitarians, the imperialists. We need to tell the world that Islam is a religion worthy of respect and that terrorism, which is the product of fundamentalism, is to be unreservedly condemned and combated. We cannot now exclude the possibility of an international policing operation to disarm Saddam Hussein, but this must be decided by a UN decision, after every avenue suggested by the inspectors that does not involve bloodshed has been tried, as General Morillon too has called for. I believe, moreover, that we have to thank the United States for having kept the spotlight on the Iraqi question and for now deploying a powerful military machine which is ready for action. The situation is responding perfectly to the US treatment, and armed conflict may well be avoided, if Iraq creates the necessary conditions for peace. Europe has therefore been dependent on the US thus far and must find its own role in the world, not just through the creation of a rapid reaction force but, above all, through effective coordination of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strive to discern Europe’s role, on every question, not just Iraq. To this end, I believe that we must invite Ariel Sharon, who has now been placed in a strong position by his electorate, to attend an international conference on the Middle East, in order to try and find a peaceful solution for all the regions which need, first and foremost, to abandon the culture of hate and encourage mutual respect and recovery of the States. Europe’s current role, then, is important and will become even more so if we succeed in influencing North America as well as Russia with Western culture, so that it will commit to respect for freedom and, at the same time, to upholding the principle of solidarity. Our culture will have to face immense challenges in the future, and it will win through if it is fully aware of its responsibility to mankind.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some will say that this is untrue, but they can smell it and they know that three quarters of oil stocks are there, that America needs them, that tomorrow China will need them; they know that these stocks, these resources, must be made available for the development of our countries, certainly, but also the southern countries. These are world stocks for everyone, and first of all also for those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a final word to young Europe, our Europe, this young girl that we are creating. This will be her hour of truth and we must harmonise the positions of her four Member States and one candidate country that are on the Security Council. What took place on Monday is not enough. We should be able to coordinate our position to decide together what we are going to do with our two rights of veto in the Security Council, anticipating what might be our future. In any case, there is no clear reason to give up, whether with regard to the meeting or the right of veto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If they find undeclared chemical or biological weapons, they have the right to destroy them. If they do not find any, their duty is to pass on this information. While this process is underway and provided that it produces the anticipated result, Iraq does not represent a threat to anyone. In its current situation, it would not even dare to set off a firecracker. There is therefore no reason to instigate a pre-emptive war. In the next few days, the States of the European Union therefore have a pressing duty to prevent unilateral military action in defiance of international law. Resolution 1441 excludes automatic recourse to the use of force.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame, therefore, that the ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE should have chosen to be ambiguous on this fundamental point. Have they not read the statement from the Episcopalian conference of German bishops, which says, and I quote: ‘a pre-emptive war is an attack and cannot be considered a just war’? I do not think the bishops have been manipulated by Saddam Hussein. Have our fellow Members in the PPE-DE not understood the churches’ call to try everything to prevent a pre-emptive war which, and I quote: ‘would remove all content from the principle of non-recourse to force laid down by international law and at the end of the day would weaken the whole system of the Community between the States’? The socialists cannot express better than the bishops what they think of the war cries from the Washington hawks. There is still time for the Christian-Democrat Members to recover, tomorrow, at the vote, and I am sure that Mr Morillon, who is a reasonable man, will use all his powers of persuasion.</p>

To misquote Tolstoy, it is no exaggeration to say that what we face is no more and no less than the dilemma of war or peace. In other words what some people see as the dilemma, that is, should Saddam Hussein stay or go, is beside the point. We are basically in the aftermath of a crisis which started back in 1979 with the Iran-Iraq war, continued with Kuwait, and is still going on today. Former allies are now adversaries and former adversaries are now allies.</p>
<p class="contents">And what are we doing about it? As the European Union, we need to act on one principle and one political commitment. The principle being that every decision must be passed by the UN Security Council and the political commitment being that we must all stand united at the UN. Last Monday, the General Affairs Council started by defining the capabilities of the European Union; let us hope that these capabilities finally translate into policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We often say, when discussing Euro-American affairs, that the Americans are our allies. Yes, they are and, as such, we supported and helped them in Afghanistan. But every American policy does not automatically have to become European policy. Let me ask you one simple question. Was Clinton’s policy on the Middle East, on Iraq and other countries, the same as Bush’s policy? No. Therefore, the political autonomy of the European Union and the principles which underpin it must always be the cornerstone of mutual respect between America and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to answer a number of questions about crisis management. You remember what we said about the crisis in the Middle East? And nobody listened to us. There is the issue of democracy in the Gulf, in Iraq and elsewhere, but this is not the time to go into that. What I would say, however, is that the democratic changes in central and eastern Europe, where we have found new partners, did not come about by taking sides and engaging in conflicts. They came about by backing off and improving relations and by paving the way for these countries and nations to move towards democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to welcome the efforts of the Greek Presidency to resolve the situation we find ourselves in. The European Parliament will perhaps adopt a common resolution tomorrow on Iraq, a resolution which I support. But I am appalled that the minimal consensus it reflects, which underlines the central role of the United Nations Security Council, is so timid.</p>
<p class="contents">Although defence and security are clearly intergovernmental matters, I believe that world peace and stability cannot be restricted to one pillar. You have said, Mr Solana, that the overwhelming majority of Europeans are unambiguously against the war. And we, in this Parliament, in order to safeguard European cohesion and our trans-Atlantic relations, vacillate and pay a high price, that of silence, and at times hypocrisy, since we are pretending to believe certain things. We are pretending to believe that the non-existence of something can be proved. We are pretending to believe that we are fighting terrorism, when there is every indication that we are going to make it infinitely worse. We are pretending to believe that Iraq is a threat to the world, when actually it is a country on its knees. We are pretending to believe that only that country has weapons of mass destruction, when the entire region is a powder keg. We are pretending to believe that the 150 000 men amassed on the borders of Iraq are only there to put pressure on Saddam Hussein. We are pretending to believe, as Mr Poignant has said, that this war does not have a terrible whiff of oil and that Bush’s real objective is to return Iraq to the Iraqis. We are also pretending to believe that democracy can be built by force on a site littered with mines and bombs. And we are pretending to believe that we will never be accomplices in a massacre and that the UN, that arbiter of international law, will play an impartial role and is not subject to horrendous pressures.</p>

Man decides to go to war; and man can put a stop to war. War can never be the right way to destroy weapons of mass destruction or combat terrorism. We are on the verge of a war that would have devastating consequences for the people of Iraq, for the whole region and the whole world. In this situation, we cannot stay silent about the legal and moral problems surrounding a war.</p>
<p class="contents">All politicians should analyse what a war with Iraq would lead to. Millions of people would be forced to flee – refugees that the neighbouring countries cannot take care of. The war could spread to Israel and Palestine, and opposition to the West could grow, resulting in more terrorist attacks. <span class="italic">Very</span> great humanitarian efforts would be needed for Iraq’s 23 million people. Is it worth the cost?</p>
<p class="contents">The war with Iraq is not about Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship or breaches of UN resolutions. If that were the case, the USA, the UN and the EU would be involved in many wars all over the world: for example, in Saudi Arabia and Israel, to name but a few. What it is really about is power over oil and power in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Charter permits the use of force for the preservation of peace only as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted. Only the Security Council can make decisions on this. Neither the United Nations Charter nor international law permits the use of force for preventive purposes, however. A preventive war is the law of the street, the justice of the powerful, which sweeps aside the international law on which the world is founded. The EU must protest strongly against this. There is no justification for Saddam Hussein’s devastating politics. His and all other weapons of mass destruction must go, <span class="italic">even</span> those in the USA, the UK and Israel, but we have <span class="italic">never </span>recommended that force be used to this end. Give the inspectors a decent amount of time, and use the time for cooperation between the EU, the Arab countries, Russia and the UN to find a peaceful solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am saying no to unilateral war. I am not a pacifist – although I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with being a pacifist – but I am seriously concerned about the impact that a unilateral war against Iraq will have on the future of the world order, and the kind of world we will live in, if we do not, as a Parliament, make our position clear: unless we have international law moderated through the United Nations, we will have no law. We cannot have the most powerful state on this earth, which regards itself as militarily invincible, deciding which target it chooses to attack, which to disarm and how and when it will launch such an attack. That is the road to anarchy; a road which will give no security for any state on the face of this earth – least of all the small state which I represent here in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">War is a failure of politics. The United Nations has an opportunity – as is made clear by the inspectors who have reported to it this week – to peacefully disarm Saddam Hussein if they are given enough time and providing Saddam Hussein pro-actively cooperates with them. We are talking about giving time to the inspectors; we are not talking about allowing Saddam Hussein to maintain – assuming he has them – weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a dim view of the attempt by Mr Watson, the leader of the Liberal Group, to demean the motives of myself and my colleagues in travelling to Baghdad this weekend to try to persuade whatever authorities we have the opportunity to meet there to cooperate actively with the inspectors and, indeed, to see first-hand the impact which sanctions are having, particularly on the children of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I know that time is up but I wish to make two short points. No link has been made in the inspectors' report to international terrorism. No evidence has been found which establishes that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction – the contrary in fact. We must give the inspectors more time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Erasmus said that war is sweet to those who do not know it. I believe we must condemn those who employ hypocrisy, double standards, half truths and total distortions in order to take us to war.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable to hear prominent speeches which, rather than promoting a genuine fight against terrorism, that is, against Al Qaida, disseminate fallacies about supposed ideologies of power and domination which are equated with militarism, when at the same time the speaker boasts of having the best army in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">A little self-analysis on the part of those who accuse the Iraqi dictator of representing a world of constant alarm and chaos would reveal who really represents an ideology of power and domination and who provokes constant alarm in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe we should be pleased to see the continuous growth within the Member States of a movement rejecting war, and positions such as that of General Schwarzkopf who, taking the approach of Erasmus, has just accused the Minister for war, Rumsfeld, of undervaluing the army and of relishing the idea of going to war, or such as that of the Democrat Senator Joseph Biden, who has accused Bush of promoting the greatest wave of anti-Americanism for 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has just said that he is in favour of peace but that he cannot share the responsibility for backing down in the face of those who threaten our security, freedom and democracy. I believe that, with sophisms of this type, it is we who endanger our freedom, our democracy and our principles and of course our security, because a society which allows lies and distortions in order to dominate the oil market and indulge in strategic whims of an imperialist nature weakens itself in the medium term and thereby jeopardises its cohesion and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, Mr Solana, we must give the UN inspectors what they are asking for: time, money, resources and information. We must give peace another chance. Unfortunately, war and violence are your preserve, the preserve of the men who rule in the decision-making centres, while the victims of war are mainly women and children. We in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities have repeatedly emphasised the need for conflicts to be resolved by peaceful means.

<p class="contents">I can provide the European Parliament with proof of this in the form of a series of significant public statements by Prime Minister Aznar in Spain, in which he demonstrates through the media his unconditional support for Bush, including for a unilateral attack. Does this attitude show loyalty to the European Union? Is this position which breaks European consensus loyal?

Thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak briefly, without exceeding the time allotted to me, to explain various issues. Firstly, there can be no doubt that this is a difficult debate. It is a debate which goes to the heart of the European Union’s foreign policy and beyond. We have a new world situation which may undoubtedly have consequences for the future which are hard to predict today. But I would like to say that we must not indulge in a sort of pessimism about the European Union’s inability to reach common positions. We are talking about such serious issues as war and peace. We are talking about something extremely grave; life or death. And it is therefore natural that so many Members of Parliament have spoken in very different ways and that the governments have also at times said so many differing things. Hence the first consequence; it will be very difficult to take a decision on war and peace, on life and death, by means of a vote on one particular day.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace and war, life and death, belong to the States and one State will never be prepared to allow another State to impose on it the obligation to go to war or, conversely, to impose that obligation to go to war on another. I say this within the context of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second issue, I believe that if we cast our minds back to the end of August and the beginning of September of last year, I believe that the majority of Members of this honourable Parliament thought, with fear or horror, that we were at the beginning of a unilateral action against Iraq. There was pressure, very significant pressure from many countries, the majority of countries of the European Union. And we should also recognise the courage of the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, at that time. Amongst all of us we managed to ensure that that operation, which appeared to be under way, was brought within the context of the United Nations. And in September of that year the Iraq dossier, which was kept outside the United Nations Security Council, outside the framework of the United Nations, was brought to the United Nations. And for seven long weeks Resolution 1441 was debated. All of this action was unquestionably led by European countries in order to achieve a unanimously approved Resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a long time since a resolution of such importance has been approved unanimously, and countries such as Syria, for example, and a few days later, as I said at the beginning, the Arab League, the Arab countries, unanimously supported the content of Resolution 1441.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the Europeans are the only people responsible for Resolution 1441, but it would be pessimistic for us not to say that we have been very instrumental in the existence of Resolution 1441. So let us reassess our feelings of pessimism or optimism: our actions have been significant and they continue to be so. Resolution 1441 obliged the inspectors, Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei, to produce a report. They were kind enough to speak with the President of the European Parliament yesterday by videoconference. The Members of this Parliament are well informed about what Mr Blix thinks. You have an in-depth knowledge of what he thinks, not only from what he has said in public, but also from what he said in that videoconference. And all the honourable Members of this House know that Dr Blix, a great European by the way – as he said himself yesterday −and a man who believes in the values of Europe, spoke to you yesterday with a degree of pessimism in his heart. This pessimism was not the result of ignorance, since he is a wise man, who has worked on the inspection of weapons of mass destruction for many years. He was somewhat pessimistic because he recognised that there had not been the cooperation he had hoped for. He had hoped, with his skill, his experience and generosity, for greater cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the first consequence we have in our hands, the first report, is a report which does not satisfy us in terms of the cooperation between Saddam Hussein and his regime and the inspectors. But despite all of this, we must continue and we have therefore asked the countries of the European Union to give all possible assistance to the inspectors. And I insist: what kind of assistance can we give? There are three types: assistance in terms of time, giving them more time; material assistance, giving them more resources if they need them; and assistance in terms of information and intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">Another achievement yesterday was that the evidence in existence which was not being distributed beyond a certain number of people, some of them amongst Dr Blix’s colleagues, will now be discussed on 5 February within the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations Security Council is still, therefore, the centre of gravity of the debate, and I believe that the countries of Europe have had a hand in this, not in every respect, but to a very considerable extent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a dynamic of pressure which must be maintained – and the inspectors are asking us to maintain it − and at the same time a political dynamic in the debate taking place in the Security Council, which will take time. There will be other sittings and no doubt this Parliament will analyse within a few days the reports which will be produced in the United Nations Security Council. On the 14 February there will be a second report from the inspectors and we will see how the situation is developing.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members may imagine, I am in constant contact with many people, with many important countries in the Security Council, and with non-European countries and non-members of the Security Council. The honourable Members will remember, because you follow this issue as closely as I do, that a few days ago in Ankara there was an important meeting of the most significant Arab countries. I would urge you to read the declaration which emerged from that meeting. That declaration is not so different from the European Union’s declaration on Monday, quite the contrary, although it is perhaps less forceful.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore working in the right direction. Will we achieve a good outcome? We will see, but we have a political dynamic which nobody would have expected a few months ago. We must therefore continue working, continue cooperating in this way with the other members of the Security Council, we must continue working with the other countries and amongst ourselves so that, at the end of this journey, we may have, as I said at the beginning, a solution to this extremely serious conflict. Because there is absolutely no doubt that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is going to be the great issue which we Europeans are going to have to deal with in the coming years and we will have to genuinely take on board the importance of this issue. And I believe that we are sometimes not sufficiently awake to the possible consequences of this, but I hope that in this case it is resolved and that the solution is a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, for my part, I will always be prepared to appear before this Parliament, however many Members are in attendance, in order to try to move forward and overcome the difficulties facing all of us at this historic moment for good or for bad. Let us hope that it is for good.</p>

The UN has shown the way: by forcing disarmament through inspections and demanding answers to the inspectors’ questions. All further action must take place within the framework of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights remain a dead letter in other countries as well; other countries also have weapons of mass destruction – Iran, Pakistan, North Korea and India for example.</p>
<p class="contents">It is inconceivable that a superpower would be able to unilaterally solve the problem by military means. The fact that Iraq has been weakened by the Gulf War ten years ago and has oil wells does not justify making an exception to this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other problems waiting to be resolved, such as the Palestine issue, the Middle East, Kashmir and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the Kurds in Iraq who are waiting for recognition of their rights as a people, but also those in Syria, Turkey and Iran. The pressure on Saddam must be maintained until the regime falls or conforms with the international rule of law. Arming a dictator, as the Russians and the Americans but also the British, French and Germans did with Saddam during his war with Iran, is costly in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The road to a durable peace must be coupled with disarmament and development. The oil in Iraq changes nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
