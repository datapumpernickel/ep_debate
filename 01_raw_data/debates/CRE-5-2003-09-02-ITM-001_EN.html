In particular, we must stress the importance of this policy for boosting cohesion in an enlarged European Union, which will experience a particular increase in disparities between levels of development in its regions and the need to make resources available to match the new requirements. It is of vital importance to bridge these differences by fostering long-term, balanced and polycentric development throughout our European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the communication by the European Commission, therefore, our committee, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, held extensive discussions which resulted in its underlining certain – what it considered to be – basic points in connection with regional and cohesion policy. Thus it:</p>
<p class="contents">- endorses the Commission’s stance of rejecting attempts at the renationalisation of regional and cohesion policy and its determination to maintain a genuine Community policy;</p>
<p class="contents">- supports the Commission’s view on the application of EU regional and cohesion policy to all the regions of the EU which, of course, meet the relevant criteria;</p>
<p class="contents">- reiterates the need for greater coordination between regional and cohesion policy and policies with a significant impact on the land, such as agriculture, fishing, transport, research and technology, education and training and information society policy;</p>
<p class="contents">- stresses the need for a link between future regional policy and European competition policy;</p>
<p class="contents">- repeats Parliament’s position that the current threshold of 0.45% of Community GDP allocated to the cohesion policy is a threshold below which it is not possible to fall;</p>
<p class="contents">- emphasises the fact that the Commission ought to pay special attention to those regions suffering from the statistical effects of enlargement and to treat them as regions similar to Objective 1 areas;</p>
<p class="contents">- calls for the European Commission to pay special attention to cases where regions have naturally emerged from Objective 1 status by their own efforts but which also require adequate financial support to consolidate their upward progress;</p>
<p class="contents">- considers that special attention should be paid to the ultra-peripheral regions and sparsely populated areas and the least favoured islands;</p>
<p class="contents">- accepts that the threshold of 75% of the average GDP in the Member States of the European Union must remain the essential criterion for eligibility for Objective 1, draws attention to the vital role played by the Cohesion Fund, especially for the new Member States and supports the idea of a new Objective 2 to foster regional competitiveness in accordance with the Lisbon and Göteborg guidelines;</p>
<p class="contents">- considers that regional areas in which permanent geographical handicaps, island or mountain areas, areas of low population density etc., which are not eligible for support from other Structural Funds, should be eligible for support from a reformed Objective 2 or from some other new specific Community initiative;</p>
<p class="contents">- backs the Commission in its regional approach to development, particularly the idea of a single programme and a single financial package per region;</p>
<p class="contents">- stresses the need for consistency in the policy for regional cooperation in its three dimensions, namely cross-border (land or sea), trans-national and inter-regional;</p>
<p class="contents">- finally, endorses the Commission’s main goal of simplifying the rules for implementing regional policy, reiterates Parliament’s request for tripartite contracts between the Commission, Member State and the region and stresses once again its conviction that it is both necessary and feasible to achieve a proper balance between simplification and scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Our parliamentary committee calls on the European Commission, and the leading Commissioner Mr Barnier in particular, to continue their efforts in the direction indicated by the European Union compass and the current climate. It also calls on plenary to accept our motion for a resolution. I should like to thank in particular all those who helped complete my report, Members and assistants alike, and all of you contributing today. I should also like to declare that I believe in the ancient Greek proverb ‘good things come in small packages’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like first to thank the two rapporteurs, both Mr Μastorakis and Mr Pomés Ruiz, and congratulate them on their work and then make a number of comments on the two reports.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mr Mastorakis’s report is concerned, I should like to comment on three points. First, on the fact, as stated in the report, that we cannot fall below 0.45% of GDP in future cohesion policy. As Commissioner Barnier has also pointed out in the past, Parliament considers that if Community funding falls below this point for cohesion policies, these policies, especially in view of enlargement, will cease to be reliable and efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns Objective 2, which will obviously have to be simplified so that actions have greater visibility and better results for citizens, which is why we prefer a new Objective 2 with thematic actions.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, a third comment to do with Mr Mastorakis’s report and Structural Fund procedures. They need to be simplified. It is becoming clear and I think it has also been understood by the Commission, which has from time to time organised seminars with local and regional authorities on the subject, especially in the run up to the new programming period, that we need to pool our thoughts as to how these actions can be made more efficient by simplifying them.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the report by Mr Pomés Ruiz on regions with a permanent structural disadvantage, such as island regions, mountain regions and the ultra-peripheral regions with low population density in the north.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like first of all to welcome the recent development in the Constitutional Convention, which has extended the concept of economic and social cohesion by adding the term ‘territorial cohesion’. Hopefully, this added term will form an adequate legal basis so that we have something more specific and more tangible in the future for these areas. Nonetheless, Parliament feels there is still a need to clarify Article 158 of the Treaty on island areas. As you know, there is a division of opinion as to how this specific article should be translated. It is translated in different ways in different languages. It needs to be clarified once and for all so that the provision for island areas is valid. Parliament also feels that, over and above structural actions, the article referring to state aid, namely Article 87, also needs to be amended so that the areas we are talking about today are also included in the areas needing special treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from all this, Mr President, Parliament – I think absolutely rightly – maintains in the report by Mr Pomés Ruiz that, within the framework of the new Objective 2, about which I have already spoken with reference to the report by Mr Mastorakis, a special thematic action is needed to cover these areas. Parliament also adds that, for these areas with a permanent geographical handicap, there can and should be a higher percentage of Community co-financing in future through the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Debates on these areas have been held in this Parliament for a great many years. The Commissioner recently ordered studies on the subject. It started with mountain areas and then moved on to island areas. I truly hope that today’s debate, and in particular the report by Mr Pomés Ruiz on structurally disadvantaged regions, really will give us the opportunity we have been seeking for years to change something and to send a message to the residents of these regions that we are taking a substantive approach to their problems, because these regions, as the Commission studies have, I think, demonstrated, are indeed at a permanent disadvantage by reason of their geographical position, which prevents them from enjoying the same competitive conditions as other regions in the European Union. The time has therefore come, Mr President, for action rather than words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that it can sometimes be problematic, but I will take the liberty of pointing it out at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the words of thanks voiced by previous speakers to the two rapporteurs. I believe that we have now taken another major step forward in this ongoing debate, thanks in particular to Mr Mastorakis's report. I should like to comment on the two reports together. It will be clear to the Commission too that there are several demands that Parliament repeatedly underlines – including in the report – and I assume that a consensus could be reached here on the following: that we do not want renationalisation; that 75% of GDP is a good yardstick and that 0.45% of GDP is a minimum if we are to be able to implement a viable European structural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to say something on the outstanding points, which are also mentioned in the reports. Many people believe that a new Objective 2, whatever it looked like, could solve their problems. We have to be more honest and cannot say to each region: you will also get in under Objective 2, once it is restructured in some way. That is why we wish to make various proposals, and these are also reflected in the reports. The first concerns the regions that will suffer from the statistical effect, the current Objective 1 regions. For these, we need to launch a new programme – let us call it a 1b programme – that is generously funded, but above all – this is very important to the regions and we must take it into account – that has a legal framework that is comparable to Article 87, and which will enable them to use the aid to meet their region's specific needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concerns the disadvantaged regions, which take centre stage in Mr Pomés Ruiz's report. Here we do not need a new Objective 2, but a very special instrument for these regions, which properly takes into account the special problems that we of course wish to acknowledge. We should not try to lump everything together here.</p>
<p class="contents">The third proposal is for a real Objective 2 for those areas undergoing structural change. Here I would, however, make a strong plea in favour of ensuring that in this case the Member States are given as much freedom as possible to use the funds as they see fit. This triad is important. It is conveyed clearly in the Mastorakis report as it stands, which is why we will of course be voting in favour of it. A few changes are probably needed to the Pomés Ruiz report to achieve this, and we hope that we will be adopting those today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Economic and social disparities between the Member States have lessened, but inequalities within the Member States have persisted and even deepened. The report reiterates Parliament’s stance on pursuing an inclusive Community cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">After enlargement a large share of regional and structural aid will go to the new Member States. That is inevitable. We must not, however, pit regions in difficulties in the present Union against poor regions in the new Member States. Through united efforts we can take care of both.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the main arguments in the reports. I am not going to go over the content of the reports again here, but I would like to highlight the importance of a few matters. The reports call for combining regional policy with other policies. With regard to economic, agricultural, transport and competition policy, for example, regional considerations should be taken into account more.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Union enlarges, the need to reform regional policy will intensify. Our group backs the Commission’s aims to simplify and clarify regional policy and urges them to accomplish this. At the same time, we have to make improvements in result orientation and programme quality, and the role that the regions play alongside the Member States and the Commission must be strengthened. This will demand determined work on the part of the Commission and the Member States also. The new programming period can no longer afford the burdensome levels of administration that frequently afflict the current regional and structural policy, and the delays and apparent messing around that is associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the special features of regions suffering from permanent geographical handicaps are recognised and identified and that solutions are sought for them. Islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated regions all have the same kind of problems. There are many in our group who have been active in trying to solve the problems of island and mountain regions. I myself know best the sparsely populated regions of the north. Development in the Union’s northernmost region is overshadowed by long distances, a low density of population, a cold climate and an ageing population as a result of people moving away in droves. The same region nevertheless holds many great opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mr Pomés Ruiz for proposing that sparsely populated regions in the north should be taken into account in the Union’s constitutional treaty. Mr Pomés Ruiz’s report has increased cohesion. We understand one another better now. The problems in the various less favoured zones can be solved through good levels of cooperation as part of the Union’s cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The inequalities in regional development continue to exist. This conclusion can also be drawn from the report by Mr Mastorakis, whom I should like warmly to congratulate.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the best efforts of those responsible for regional policy at European and national level, the challenges that we face today in the year 2003 are not diminishing. They are becoming even greater if you consider the stagnant economy and the sharp increase in unemployment in many European countries. A very great burden is placed on economic and social cohesion even today. The enlargement of the European Union to include ten more countries from central and eastern Europe will not only increase regional disparities and thus place an even greater strain on cohesion, but, as the expiry of the current support period from 2000 to 2006 approaches, the debate on the shape of future regional policy from 2007 is also coming to the fore.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the assessment of the criteria for measuring the development status and thus the eligibility of a region is a priority issue. Factors in regional development such as the rate of industrialisation, the level of poverty and social exclusion, the level of unemployment, the potential for research and development, the training capacity, the sustainability of development and the development of environmental protection, all need to be taken into account in the assessment alongside the present single criterion of GDP per head of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of particular concern to me, as it is to other Members from Objective 1 areas, that these special regions do not fall out of the highest support bracket because of a change in the arithmetic due to the accession of the new Member States. For them the principle should apply that they can claim the same financial support and rights to subsidies as they did before enlargement. I also support Mr Mastorakis's statement in his report about the shape of future Objective 2 areas, that is how they and the Objective 3 measures for disadvantaged groups are to be restructured, and welcome his comments on how eligibility for these measures will be determined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Integration means establishing social and economic cohesion in an EU of 25 and, if you will pardon my saying so Commissioner, you still have not given us your blueprint for achieving this, although it is high time that you did so. There is no trace of even a strategy in the Second progress report on cohesion. It seems to me that you think that distributing money here, there and everywhere will somehow keep everyone happy. No, Commissioner, we cannot afford to do that anymore, because if we do not manage to bring about economic and social cohesion in this EU of 25 the whole edifice will come tumbling down! We need root and branch reform of the Structural Funds and we need clear guidance on what our aims are when spending the money. Where those aims are concerned, we were of course taught a hard and painful lesson in the last two summers: last year we had floods; this year it was fire.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I think it is clear that at long last we have to be guided by the Göteborg conclusions: that sustainable development has to be at the heart of the Structural Funds; that social and employment policy aspects on the one hand and economic aspects on the other have to be given equal weight, and that EU money should only be deployed if this is the case. In too many places we have simply squandered EU funds, and this is no longer acceptable in an EU of 25.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that specific geographical characteristics do bring with them particular development requirements, but unlike many Members of this House I do not think that geographical characteristics are a disadvantage in themselves, but that poverty in these areas is much more of a disadvantage. I only have criticism for the attempts being made by many Members here to protect their vested rights and secure their own stipends, when surely the actual aim has to be economic and social cohesion. I protest against any attempts to introduce new criteria here that do not relate to poverty and unemployment, which cause people real suffering. That is why I believe that it is right for the Commission to stick to its goals and, particularly in areas where there are difficulties, for the poverty criteria to be the decisive ones and not the geographical characteristics. Only then, with these sound principles, will it be possible to tackle different kinds of difficulties, for example the problems of restructuring in many areas, including in wealthier countries, the restructuring difficulties in agriculture, female poverty and the depopulation of urban areas. These things too should be taken into account and we have a whole series of instruments to enable us to do so, for example phasing out and subsidies. I hope, Commissioner, that you will finally table a clear blueprint for achieving sustainable development through the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few years ago, I submitted a document to President Prodi on the relationship between enlargement and the repercussions that it would have in certain regions of our Community, in particular in southern Italy. Since the war, we have witnessed a strange phenomenon: whilst, previously, history revolved around hostility between East and West, now, as if by a strange twist of fate, we are dealing with a European Community where the problems are between North and South, and always between a rich and prosperous North and a poor South.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, enlargement has been a factor in our considerations, and our conclusion is that a war between the poor must be avoided, given the consequences of such an occurrence. I am writing a report on European public finances in 2003 and it shows that we are facing problems of increased GDP in some countries and falling GDP in others. Even countries that, a few years ago, more or less balanced their budgets, now find themselves near to negative projections.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, should we manage these Structural Funds? The rapporteurs do well to give broad guidelines in their reports. I believe that we need to ensure that Objective 2 is not too all-embracing; we need to ensure that the Member States can manage Structural Funds that have been obtained in the first stage properly and coordinate them more effectively in the next stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It highlights the need to take account of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy, over and above the purely economic and social aspects. This policy must be founded on the principle of solidarity, in order to reduce the disparities between regions, and to establish the principle of the equality of European citizens, regardless of where they live.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we should provide our fellow citizens with equal access to high-quality public services, which are the very social fabric of the regions of Europe. We should also recognise the special character, the quality of life and natural resources of the people of structurally disadvantaged regions, together with their heritage and their know-how. I agree with the rapporteur that it would be a mistake to concentrate all our financial support on the new Member States, and to neglect the currently eligible areas. We must remember that enlargement will increase regional disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the proposal to supplement Article 158 of the EC Treaty. This will mean that more account will be taken of the structural handicaps of islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated areas, in proportion to the severity of the difficulties experienced. These regions were sidelined under previous programmes. It is essential that they are now recognised in terms of accessibility, communication, infrastructure, financing and access to public services. This is vital if an exodus to the cities and the ageing of the population is to be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Endelave declaration was signed during a fact-finding visit made by the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities to this location, an island of 183 inhabitants in central Denmark. This declaration addresses the specific situation of small European islands, which can function perfectly well. It seeks to allow the people of these small islands to access good-quality services, such as ferries, doctors, veterinary surgeons, schools, ministers, home-helps and libraries, as long as financial support is provided in the spirit of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, I feel I must highlight the importance of increasing the involvement of Member States and their decentralised authorities in cohesion policy. These bodies are closer to, and more aware of, the reality on the ground in their region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The compromise that was reached after lengthy discussions with the rapporteur and the adoption of numerous amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is to be welcomed, and as the report now stands it should achieve a majority in the House. I am thinking here both of the budget for cohesion policy of 0.45% of GDP and of keeping Objective 1 areas as the main focus of our support. I welcome the threshold of 75% of GDP per head at NUTS II level being retained as the main criterion for determining Objective 1 status, provided that at the same time the so-called statistical effect is neutralised. We are all aware that at the end of the current support period those regions affected by the statistical effect will not of course have exceeded the 75% threshold in the present EU. Overnight, or to be more precise between 30 April and 1 May next year, a stroke of a mathematical pen will turn poor wretches into wealthy people, although they will not have a cent more to their name. That is the so-called statistical effect. These regions continue to require resources from the Structural Funds to consolidate and further the process of economic and social convergence, which they have begun so successfully in previous support periods. That is why the report clearly underlines, on the basis of our amendments submitted in the committee, that particular attention must be paid to the regions suffering from the impact of these statistical changes, and that in the future too these areas should be treated as similar to Objective 1 areas with the equivalent level of support and with the aid administered in accordance with Article 87, paragraph 3(a).</p>
<p class="contents">Existing transitional arrangements – phasing out – do not do justice to the specific problems of these areas caught by the statistical effect. The report, as it stands, should also find the support of the majority of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is needed is a very pragmatic approach, as taken by the rapporteur and, undoubtedly, by the Commissioner, too, in his work.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of the European Union is firmly linked to the quality and future of cohesion policies. Only if we do not have a three-speed Europe, which is the risk we are running, will we genuinely be able to talk about a process of political integration. For this to happen, certain conditions have to be met: it is essential that we confirm our unequivocal rejection of any renationalisation of regional policies. As many colleagues have said, it is essential to make the 0.45% threshold a minimum threshold, in the sense that the European Union’s commitment in cohesion policies cannot fall below this percentage, and it is good that, given the decisions facing the European Union on the eve of enlargement, this is being established<span class="bold"> </span>as a political principle and not merely as an arithmetic one.</p>
<p class="contents">As other colleagues have said and as I would like to reiterate, we need to avoid some regions suddenly finding themselves classed as rich because of the impact on the statistics. Therefore, better phasing-out needs to be devised for Objective 1 regions, which will be excluded following enlargement, and, above all, the permanent geographical handicap of many regions needs to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I believe that these permanent geographical handicaps and the need for a Community strategy which can overcome them need to be recognised in the next Constitutional Treaty. The declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the structural disadvantages of islands has never been converted into specific measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to urge the Commission to make greater endeavours to simplify the regional policy implementation rules and to ensure clearer distribution of responsibilities and competences between all those involved in cohesion policy. I would also like to call upon the Commission to continue with the endeavour that has been made thus far to lay down some priorities in cohesion policies. Consider how important it is today to invest in the quality of knowledge, in the quality of innovation, in technological research and immaterial infrastructure. We believe that the future of Europe should be viewed less in terms of concrete construction and much more in terms of the quality of knowledge we can offer.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, Mr President, the wealthy regions are not in danger of becoming poor. Quite the opposite: there is the danger that some poor regions will remain as such in the long term. We want to avoid this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak not only for my own country of Scotland but also from knowledge of some of the more remote Greek islands and of the north of Finland and Sweden. However, the problems of island status, mountainous terrain and sparse population affect many areas in other Member States and in some accession countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">One very great merit of the report is its recognition of the effects where these problems are combined or aggravated. I welcome particularly in this regard the proposed amendment to Article 158 of the Treaty, as also the thrust towards mainstreaming issues of structural disadvantage into EU policy more generally.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to single out the calls for mountainous regions to be classified as agriculturally disadvantaged in relation to Structural Fund regulations, for permanent geographical handicaps to be taken more fully into account where rules on state aid are concerned and for the causes of emigration to be addressed. In the latter context, the relevance of isolation and difficulty of access is already well known, particularly where islands are concerned. Therefore, I wish to couple my welcome for today's reports with that of the analysis of island regions sponsored by the Commission. Some concern was expressed in Scotland that because certain types of island were excluded from the study they might suffer where future policymaking was concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">However, looking to the emphasis it places on the disadvantages associated with small size and population of archipelagos and on double handicap – for example islands with mountains – it was clear there was no need for such concerns. Indeed, the suggestions made in the study for more research and exchange of information and for innovative projects under Interreg looked to bring real practical benefits to all those whose lives are island ones. My thanks are thus due to the Commissioner and to the rapporteur – indeed, both rapporteurs alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They do not, however, have anything to say about the inequalities within the same country, including the richest ones.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we dare to speak of economic and social cohesion in a society where there is an ever-increasing disparity between the income of the richest and the poorest? How can we have the effrontery to speak of cohesion when big companies lay off workers to increase the stock market value of their shares, knowing that, in so doing, they are condemning their employees to poverty? The policy of the various governments entails bandying about the word reform, whilst hammering workers by reducing their retirement, extending their working time, cutting their social protection, holding back their salaries and making jobs less and less secure. What is the meaning of social cohesion when governments are doing all this in order to increase the profits of big companies and increase the fortunes of shareholders? What does social cohesion mean when governments are cutting their funding to essential public services in order to cut taxes for the richest?</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that, if the European Union is incapable of dealing with social inequalities, it cannot hope to eliminate inequalities between the regions because the two are connected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, they refer to structural issues that could foster such cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports refer to a geographical dimension that relates to mountains and islands, and also to a social dimension. The latter represents a new approach, and relates mainly to depopulation. We would suggest that another new Europe-wide phenomenon should be taken into account also. I refer to the ageing of the population and the shortage of productive members of the labour force required to develop the economy. This has been noted in all the inland regions of Europe. It is especially true of areas like my constituency. I represent Aragon in Spain. Two-thirds of the population of Aragon live in a single city. The region extends over 47 000 square kilometres and the whole of the interior is becoming depopulated. The problem is not a lack of employment opportunities or a shortage of work. It is that nobody wants to go there to work. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to consider how to overcome that obstacle. This really is a structural problem, because it is a question of attitude. People simply do not wish to go and work in inland regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday Commissioner Barnier outlined the difficulties facing Portugal. What were the individuals affected by the problems resulting from the fires and the heat wave to do? Where were they to seek employment, in the large cities, on the coast? Are we to plan for a coastal Europe, a Europe of large cities? Or should we be aiming at a balanced Europe? We believe it is time to bring a new factor into the equation, namely the ageing of the population. Furthermore, such ageing is inevitable. It is also important to tackle the shortage of productive members of the labour force and the difficulty of persuading people to seek employment in certain areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement will reveal dramatically once again the complete lack of practical responses to an objective on which the European Union and the Treaties preceding it were founded. We need only to think of a survey conducted a few years ago, which showed that Lombardy was one of the top 20 wealthiest regions while Sicily, my homeland, was in seventy-seventh place. This shows just how far we are in practice from the objectives of achieving a proper, sound, tangible economic and social cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been no strategy, no will to take practical measures, no polycentric Europe. Southern Italy and the Mediterranean have been left on the fringe of a genuine growth and stability strategy. The problems are not only due to geographical remoteness, which would, alone, be grounds for huge-scale, effective measures, but there is also an incredible lack of infrastructure, a lack of planning in the areas of training, technological innovation research and improving the universities in marginal regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need to preserve the European Union’s minimum intervention threshold, we need to stem the flow of people leaving mountain areas, we need to intervene in disadvantaged islands, which are disadvantaged not only because of their distance from mainland Europe but also because of inherent problems to which Europe must find an immediate solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, even the rapporteur admits that on enlargement, Europe's regional income disparities will increase dramatically.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner stresses that in the EU of 15, 48 regions – accounting for 18% of the population – had a per capita income below 75% of the average, whereas in an enlarged Union a total of 67 regions will fall below the 75% threshold – representing 26% of total population. Yet instead of structural funds being granted to economically deprived areas, the rapporteur proposes that, on enlargement, money should be channelled to disadvantaged mountainous, remote or island regions – a much narrower definition for distribution. So a system that is already inherently bad becomes even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual nations know precisely where help is needed within their own domains and yet the European Union is determined to exert its authority by controlling structural support for what it considers to be impoverished regions. If control of funding were to be returned to national governments, I am confident that the UK Government would be aware of the serious need for funding in my own region – the South-West – where we have suffered tremendously from the effects of the EU's disastrous common fisheries policy and common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding administered by our own government would ensure that the whole transport infrastructure – rail, road and air – receives the attention it deserves for the benefit of all our small businessmen in the South-West, and all of those people involved in our vital tourism industry. We know where funding is needed far better than the bureaucrats in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today is no different.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely rare that an instance occurs when I can say that I am in complete agreement with a member of the UK Labour Party. This happened recently in a landmark speech by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, who, as we all know, called for the repatriation of regional aid. In essence, this is a good idea. The current system is, as we have repeatedly seen, unworkable, and the bureaucracy is becoming increasingly stifling.</p>
<p class="contents">Time and again we have seen reports passing through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism highlighting the inequalities that exist as a result of a system that fails the very people it sets out to help. I know that the idea Mr Brown mooted was not well received here – or indeed in the Commission – not least by members of his own party. I have my doubts over just how far the UK Government will push for this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted against the Mastorakis report in committee, not because it was a bad report but because there were references I felt we could not ignore. Clearly, paragraph 2's stout defence of the Commission's stance in rejecting renationalisation would differ from my own view, as we have already discussed. Nor can I support any reference to tripartite contracts: by allowing the Commission to institute such actions directly with regions, we would be allowing our nation states to be bypassed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always voiced my concerns at these repeated attempts to circumvent national parliamentary scrutiny. I shall continue to do so because I see this as a dangerous precedent, opening the door to a Europe of the regions by stealth – something I totally reject.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude with a stark fact: billions of euros are still in the Commission's coffers, without a chance of being spent. In future, what we need is a more focused and concentrated approach on coordinated priorities for funding, cross-border projects or major items of Community interest – the rest should be left to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim should be economic integration and an understanding of the differences arising from regional disparities. We must take full account of the needs of the new Member States in future proposals to ensure there is effective use of aids to achieve structural reforms and that the aids have permanent effects on citizens’ lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are taking the new Member States into full consideration, the regions in the current Member States needing special support must also be included in any new plans. I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz, for having very seriously proposed that regions with permanent structural constraints should also be included in any special aid programmes in the future. Such permanent constraints are, for example, remoteness and geographical isolation. These regions, moreover, have a low population density and difficult climatic conditions. It is vital that these permanent handicaps should be seen as the same kind of factor that hampers competitiveness as that which has been described regarding island regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the means by which aid is delivered to the outlying, sparsely populated northern regions is not the most important consideration, as long as these needs are taken account of with a sufficient sense of solidarity and equality. I also trust that, whilst the new proposal on structural and regional policy after 2007 is being drafted during this autumn, the Commission will show a sense of fairness and also include in its proposal the regions that have a low population density which are situated in the north and where distances are long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regions with permanent handicaps must be regarded in a new way in aid policy. I believe this fundamental revaluation to be important. There are handicaps that are ongoing. We in sparsely populated Finland are familiar with such disadvantages, and these were also noted in the important accession treaty for Finland, Sweden and Austria. Mountain regions and archipelagos may also be of relevance in this connection, however. At any event, I should like to see islands and archipelagos given special treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">When Finland became a member of the EU, it was difficult for us to maintain important aid arrangements. For example, certain general forms of transport aid were examined extremely critically by the Commission. It is not large amounts of aid we are requesting for sparsely populated areas, the archipelago and mountain areas, but such sums may be crucial to it being possible to maintain services. An important part of the policy may also consist of countries being given opportunities to receive certain smaller sums by way of general aid and of companies that maintain services of general interest being required to ensure that such services operate.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need rules within agricultural policy enabling small-scale agriculture in the archipelago to survive. That is incredibly important for the archipelago as a part of our world heritage and as something that we are trying to administer as well as possible. The European Convention proposes similar changes, something for which we are extremely grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that the concept of territorial cohesion was really originated by the CPMR under its then chairman, Stig Östdahl. I am extremely pleased that, today as well, Parliament can contribute to new and important thinking that must be of use in enabling people to live and prosper in all parts of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, in numerous cases, not only has there been no reduction in the development gap, but also enlargement has widened the gap between the regions lagging behind and the developed regions. This is true both of the island and mountain regions and of the towns plagued by mass unemployment and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, after 23 years of integration, Greece is still the poorest country in the European Union. It is becoming poorer and poorer, with regions in which the <span class="italic">per capita </span>income is falling. The lack of resources and constant cutbacks have not helped to strengthen the widely broadcast concept of cohesion or stabilise the level of development. On the contrary, they have resulted in shake-ups which have exacerbated the economic and social disintegration of the regions. In addition, the poor regions have more than doubled since enlargement. This state of affairs, Mr President, is such that we cannot accept the rapporteurs’ appraisal of the excellent results achieved during the course of the economic and social cohesion of the regions of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On an organisational and political basis, the EU at present deals with all the islands under the one heading, so that even very small and sparsely populated islands come into the same category as islands with many thousands of inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself live on a small island, Endelave, which has 180 inhabitants and is situated an hour’s sail out into the Kattegat. Clearly, we live under quite different conditions than those prevailing in, for example, Corsica or other islands with many thousands of inhabitants. The challenges are quite different, and we cannot be placed in the same category as the large islands.</p>
<p class="contents">That also applies to the Commission’s analyses of the islands’ special circumstances and potential. The small islands must be eliminated from this analysis and be given their own status, with different conclusions being drawn about them and their opportunities for development. In that connection, it is important also to recognise the union of small islands that already exists under the name of the European Small Islands' Network.</p>
<p class="contents">To the extent that structural development funds exist, the very small islands must also be allocated these, and national scope must be created for supporting development on the very small islands. Their particular handicap necessitates support for development processes that can increase settlement and employment, that is to say the promotion of a year-round society on the small islands too.</p>
<p class="contents">The ferry connection is quite crucial in this connection. First and foremost, it is important for the ferries serving the small islands to be exempted from the EU’s tendering requirements. The tendering demanded by the EU and implemented in connection with the ferries serving Denmark’s small islands has led to large expenditure for the ferry companies, but no one has made them an offer. It is quite grotesque that, on the one hand, we should have a set of regulations that inflicts unnecessary expenditure upon the small islands and their lifeblood, while we, at the same time, talk about development aid for these areas. The ferries must be regarded as the islands’ only highway. It is a question of creating equal conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I notice with satisfaction that you have adopted an acceptable course, that the general approach of giving recognition to all geographically disadvantaged regions in the Union, with islands, of course, in first place, has met with broad consensus and success, and this seems to be the line taken by the Commission. I have noted that, at least according to the intentions that have been revealed to date, this will not be restricted to a petition of principle but it will take the form of genuine aid, of the inclusion of these regions in one of the objectives and, therefore, of what is actually crucial aid for key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of things must, however, be clarified: firstly, the rewording of Article 158. I have tabled an amendment as a reminder that, once again, there has been a long discussion on this subject relating to the infamous translations, that has now ended, giving recognition to all islands through Article 158. The text prepared by Mr Mastorakis could be considered to be ambiguous on this point and I have tabled an amendment to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I would like to emphasise, particularly while the Commissioner is here, is that we have long been calling for the creation of a special unit for islands. It was done for the outermost regions and I believe that such a unit would provide valuable information and, consequently, facilitate the implementation of strategic measures for this fragile sector. I hope that the rapporteurs and the Commission will favour the amendments that I have tabled and that they can be incorporated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Concentrating resources on the Objective 1 regions should, therefore, constitute one of the key pillars of cohesion policy for the period 2007–2013, as is the case now. This would be in line with the principles of solidarity and redistribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession of the candidate countries to the European Union will, in statistical terms, reduce the average GDP of the European Union. Accordingly, the Commission’s progress report states that 18 regions should lose Objective 1 status. They would nevertheless benefit from the support provided under the phasing out mechanism. The French overseas departments will not be affected. They will continue to be classed as Objective 1 in 2007, insofar as their per capita GDP will remain well below 75% of the new European Union average.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it would be appropriate to foster equality between regions by taking account of the permanent difficulties affecting islands, mountain regions and regions with low population density. Community intervention of this kind would be counterbalanced by a range of territorial criteria. The latter would be used to define priorities and to determine the extent of the means to be allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I feel it is useful to bear in mind that the concept of ultra-peripheral regions must never be confused with that of peripheral regions, islands or structurally disadvantaged regions, regardless of any relationship of solidarity between all these regions. This is because the special legal status of the ultra-peripheral regions is due to their very remoteness from the continent of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The contribution of other European Union policies is the weakest element of the current progress report. In particular, this concerns the system of governance to be implemented so as to ensure that cohesion policy produces the best possible results in the regions concerned. I have in mind agriculture, rural development, transport, innovation, education and training. I am also thinking of competition policy in the context of state aids to regions and tax concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to conclude on two encouraging points. Firstly, there is consensus on the need for real improvements to the financial systems and administrative procedures of the Structural Funds. Lastly, I am encouraged that the suggestion that regional policy should be renationalised has lost support. Had it not, it would most certainly have brought European integration to a grinding halt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People must be able to reside throughout Europe. It is important also to be able to live in those areas that are most vulnerable when market forces promote urbanisation in Europe. European policy must, therefore, also promote cohesion. There must be a regional policy. At the same time, there must also be a regional dimension to national policy, for every country has responsibility for there being regional solidarity within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now, in connection with enlargement, have a solidarity policy, and we must bind Europe together. That must happen through regional policy, but also through transport policy and competition policy, which are at least as important if we are to be able to live throughout Europe. We must also have territorial cohesion. I am looking forward to a treaty in which territorial cohesion has an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in the future, most of the funds from regional policy should go to the new Member States, but we must also look to the special conditions that exist in Europe if we are to be able to live throughout the continent. I therefore find it extremely commendable that we have obtained the Pomés Ruiz report, in which mountains, islands and regions with low population density are highlighted and in which attention is drawn to the special role of regional policy in Europe when it comes to aid for these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, aid for mountain regions, islands and regions with low population density is therefore important. We must be able to live in these areas. European policy must not place obstacles in the way of development in these regions. At the same time, it is also important for us to have a regional policy involving decentralisation and people having to take responsibility for development in their own regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cohesion policy is a basic precondition for the existence and legitimacy of the EU as a whole. A mechanism is needed which will also boost prosperity in the most disadvantaged regions. Cohesion policy is founded on the Treaty on European Union. Both in the present Treaty and that being drafted by the European Convention regional and social cohesion is presented as a principle that runs through all policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">When the new Member States join the European Union, they will all be in need of structural development. The danger is that regional and structural policy funding with regard to the old Member States will decrease. Then these least favoured regions in terms of their economy would be having to pay more for enlargement than the regions that are economically the strongest, which, on the other hand, will benefit most from it. For that reason, funding for the former eligible areas must not be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland and Sweden in particular, there are sparsely populated, remote regions, the current Objective 1 areas, for which access to markets is difficult. That is why these regions should be considered very remote areas on a par with the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular problem is the way the Structural Funds are currently administered, which is inefficient and bureaucratic. This is visible in the under utilisation of funds, which is catastrophic. In 2000, EUR 6.7 billion of appropriations remained unspent; in the following year the amount was EUR 8.7 billion, and in 2002 it was EUR 6.2 billion. Outstanding commitments now stand at more than EUR 90 billion, or almost the equivalent of the budget for three years. This jeopardises the credibility of this whole area of policy. Administration must be dramatically reformed and greatly simplified. The so-called n+2 rule, created to make administration more efficient, does not work, because the Commission accepts repeated advance payments as means of payment, even though the project itself should not even have been started. That is why this rule too should be revised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my support for the ideas expressed by the rapporteur, and take this opportunity to thank him for the remarkable quality of his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional policy and cohesion policy have played and continue to play a vital role in the development of Member States such as Portugal and their full integration into the European Union. I am delighted that some European regions, including some regions of Portugal, have left the Cohesion Fund through their own efforts. That is without a doubt the best example of the success of this Community policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not be forgotten, however, that although major differences already exist between some European regions in terms of their levels of development, these disparities will become even more marked after enlargement. In order to realise the full potential of its cohesion policy, thus reducing inequality in regional development, the European Union must maintain its support of current Member States at a constant level. At the same time, it must also develop the regions containing the future Member States in a balanced way. Faced with this double challenge, the European Union’s duty is to make sufficient funds available to meet the new demands of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, the current threshold of 0.45% of Community gross domestic product must never fall victim to budget cuts of any kind. For that reason, and because the cohesion policy has proved to be a success in Portugal, I oppose the renationalisation of this development tool. I welcome the Commission’s establishment of a transitional scheme for regions suffering from the ‘statistical’ effects of enlargement, losing their eligibility as a result of Objective 1 being opened up to less-developed regions. Finally, I have nothing but praise for the creation of a new Objective 2, on the basis of regional competitiveness in accordance with the guidelines laid down at the Lisbon Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have highlighted the importance of cohesion policy for the European Union, and therefore for the people of Europe. The cohesion policy is a policy of solidarity, particularly for the structurally disadvantaged regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the fundamental policies of the European Union are being called into question. The press are referring to the so-called extra costs in exaggerated terms. It is essential to underline how vital these policies are, especially for the regions that have benefited from them to date. How far behind would they have lagged in terms of development without European Union aid? These are the policies that make the European Union come alive for its citizens. They are policies advocating solidarity, redistribution and the creation of bridges between areas that are not experiencing the same difficulties. I have no hesitation in saying that these policies have brought the European Union alive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incumbent upon us to ensure policies like these are retained. We must keep on the right track. It is not a question of restructuring the European budget to make it more dynamic; rather it is a matter of increasing the budget. If the European Union wants to do more, it must provide itself with the means to do so. I must emphasise one point in particular. It concerns our development indicators. GDP alone is no longer a relevant criterion. Now we have achieved a certain degree of macro-equity in Europe, it is time to refine these criteria. Micro-economic indicators must be taken into account and this assessment should constantly inform our future action. I am now thinking in particular of the regions affected by desertification and suffering from structural handicaps in relation to employment, training, amenities, accessibility and demography.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should now have all the necessary staff in place following the reform. I trust, therefore, it will ensure that these funds are actually spent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This means that we have to expect some difficulties and delays. They cannot, however, be a pretext for giving up, still less for renationalisation or even a mere resizing of these policies; that would be tantamount to trying to cure a headache by decapitation: I do not think that this is the route to take. More efficiency and certainly not fewer resources are, therefore, the way forward for effective simplification, Community added-value for all interventions, together with coordination with other policies, beginning with transport and research policies as well as the common agricultural policy, so that the right hand does not deny what the left is doing. The same should be true for the updated Objective 2, which cannot become a source of indiscriminate compensation, indiscriminately granted to all the regions because of the temptations that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, a few observations regarding the two specific, additional problems that we are facing: as regards the statistical impact, on which much has already been said, I agree with the rapporteur’s proposals, but, regarding interventions in regions with structural territorial handicaps – islands and mountain regions – we should not forget that we are talking about structural handicaps. In this case, cohesion policies should have a definition and objective instruments that are permanent and ongoing, not one offs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disparity in the level of development between the richest and poorest regions will be doubled. We must, therefore, face up to the challenge of cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, territorial cohesion is needed to take account of the geographical diversity of the European Union, in order to ensure that all European citizens are treated equally. Secondly, economic and social cohesion are necessary to ensure that the regions that are currently most vulnerable are not sacrificed on the altar of enlargement. At stake is whether the people accept the reality of enlargement. The very fabric of our common project is being tested in this way. A supportive, fair and unitary regional policy must be developed. It must not be a uniform policy, however. Account needs to be taken of the specific regional situations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it is encouraging that the Convention chose to retain the content of Article 299, paragraph 2 of the treaty on the ultra-peripheral regions and make room for it in the future constitutional treaty. This is an initial first victory. It has yet to be confirmed by the Heads of State or Government. There is still a long way to go, and crucial questions remain to be answered. For example, what importance should be attached to the report published this summer raising the fear that regional policy might be renationalised? How could better account be taken of the specific situations of regions in the next financial programme? Lastly, how can the unique and original dimension nature of the ultra-peripheral regions be translated into concrete measures in the next programming period?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are all currently working towards European integration. The citizens of Europe will assess our success on the basis of the proposals that you draw up in coming months. For my part, I trust Europe will become socially just and economically competitive. Above all, however, I hope it will become a territorially balanced Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to comment on three areas. Firstly, Europe is a Community of peace. This presupposes that we have a transparent, efficient democracy that is close to the people, that we respect freedom and accept responsibility, practise non-discrimination and show solidarity. It is solidarity that we are talking about today.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, solidarity is not a question of charity, but of distribution and holistic thinking. Neither is solidarity limited to the nation state. If we want to make the internal market into a domestic market then we must not renationalise the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that if you look at the Constitutional Treaty our vision has won through, because now it is actually a question of negotiating our statement of beliefs. The policy areas mentioned are only the means of achieving those objectives. I should like to quote Article 3 just briefly: 'The Union shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth, a social market economy, [that is] highly competitive ... It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection ... It shall promote economic, social and territorial cohesion, and solidarity among Member States’ Two of our fundamental values in Article 2 are solidarity and non-discrimination. And in doing so it is all about putting definite measures in place to achieve the European Union's objective.</p>
<p class="contents">My final and third point is that I would also ask the Commission to take into account the areas that we have mentioned today when it is drafting a framework regulation on services of general economic interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s own assessment of the increased disparities within an enlarged Union suggests these will be twice what they are at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In mid-July, shortly after the end of our parliamentary year, summaries of research undertaken under the guidance of André Sapir, an academic, appeared in the press. President Prodi circulated the research to the rest of the Commission. In their work, Mr Sapir and a team of experts openly queried the appropriateness of the current Community budget spending structure, notably as regards the CAP and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I do not wish to cast doubt on the usefulness of research of this nature. I realise it can prove very useful and lead to improvements. I would, however, like to query the method adopted on this occasion. I am particularly unhappy about the timing. This is because of the resulting uncertainty and the fear concerning the future of the cohesion policy and Community support for the most disadvantaged regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is only eight months away. Regions set to exceed the crucial threshold of 75% of Community GDP as a result of the statistical factor need to know what provision the Commission intends to make for them. The aim of full employment and economic growth must apply in particular to the current Objective 1 regions. That is where growth is slowest and unemployment highest, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you to confirm in the House that concentration will remain a valid principle in the future. Structural aid would then continue to be channelled mainly to the most disadvantaged regions of Europe. As we understand it, cohesion is first and foremost territorial cohesion. Its purpose is to ensure that the most backward regions can also benefit from the effects of the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The truth is that while, on the one hand, enlargement is the greatest challenge which has ever faced this Community policy, it is easy, on the other, to discern a lacklustre and even reluctant political will to address the overwhelming need to revitalise this central plank of European integration. Instead of revitalising the policy, the talk is sometimes of renationalising it; instead of more resources and more solidarity, national self-interest rears its head. Despite this atmosphere, however, I have not yet lost hope of seeing visionary and unified political responses such as those given to the great European challenges of achieving the single internal market and Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Back then, at the time of each of those challenges, the resources dedicated to the economic and social cohesion policy were doubled. Now, at the time of enlargement, that ambition to deal with the enormous regional inequalities stemming from that enlargement is much needed, not least because cohesion policy will in future also have to confront the lack of cohesion still prevalent in the current fifteen-State European Union. This lack of cohesion risks becoming even more serious as a result of the dynamics introduced by enlargement and by the probably unfair distribution of its benefits. It makes perfect sense for the countries which will gain most from enlargement to contribute most to funding European solidarity. This is yet another hope founded on the stance adopted by the Commission and, in particular, by Commissioner Barnier, who, I am glad to say, has never ceased to believe, come rain or come shine, in the feasibility of an effective European-level economic and social cohesion policy, endowed with a minimum level of financial resources: simpler, less centralised, more effective and with other Community policies making a greater contribution towards the aims of cohesion; a cohesion policy which must improve the way it responds to the needs of island and mountainous regions, sparsely-populated regions and, of course, ultra-peripheral regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hopefully we all realised during the summer that there is life outside Parliament too.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time, however, to ask ourselves honestly whether current regional policy meets real needs. I do not believe the policy should continue along the current lines with only minor changes being made. Parliament has stressed that 0.45% of the Union’s GDP should be used to finance this policy. How on earth, though, did we arrive at precisely that figure? First we should survey the regions’ needs and the most cost-effective means by which those needs may be met. It is not prudent to commit to any fixed sum in advance. Obviously, you can pour however much you like into something like this, but is it wise?</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we still need a responsible EU regional policy. Is it sensible, however, to share out aid among all the regions with each one getting just a few crumbs, and at enormous administrative cost? We should consider Britain’s proposal that there should only be support for the EU’s poorest regions. In practice this would mean that only the new Member States would receive aid. Other regional aids would be nationalised, so that EU bureaucracy may be avoided. I would nevertheless like to emphasise that the current Member States would not lose out under the reform, as, with enlargement, aids will diminish dramatically in any case. Naturally, the contributions of the present Member States would be reduced by the amount of reduced aids.</p>
<p class="contents">Any major change such as this still unfortunately comes up against a brick wall regarding policy. Politicians’ favourite occupation has always been to dole out other people’s money. Funds of money held jointly, however, should be handled even more carefully than our own, as wasting money in any way is always taking it away from the most deprived members of society. If we are going to make the EU a dynamic area, as we said we would at Lisbon, we should understand that money does not grow on trees, not even in this age of GMOs. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we owe it to those who vote for us to act honestly and in accordance with their long-term interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks also go to Messrs Mastorakis and Pomés Ruiz for their outstanding work.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting economic and social cohesion must be given top priority, particularly in an enlarged Union. The discrepancies between richer and poorer regions will be much greater in the Union of 25. The past has shown, however, how meaningful programmes under European regional policy can make an important contribution to creating similar living conditions. It is obvious that in the future it is precisely the regions in the acceding countries that will be in receipt of European aid, because it is in regional policy that we actually see Europe in action and catch a glimpse of European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member from Saxony, I know what it has been possible to achieve thanks to European solidarity in eastern Germany, in Saxony. That is why I can only welcome the Commission's talk in the Second progress report of a just settlement for the 18 regions in the current Member States that would be caught by the statistical effect. I do not need to convince you that just because the regions are calculated to be rich from a statistical point of view does not mean that their structural problems are resolved. That is why it is not only a just but also a robust solution that needs to be found for the 18 regions concerned. Special transitional arrangements must make it possible for them to be treated in the future if not as Objective 1 areas then at least as similar to Objective 1 areas and to have their aid administered accordingly. Only in this way will the funds that they have received hitherto pay dividends in the long term and not prove to have been worthless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The mountain regions are rich in a number of different kinds of resources – environmental, economic and human – but they need direct, practical aid to enable these resources to be successfully harnessed.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the statistics, 30% of Europe is taken up by mountains and, with enlargement, this specific feature, this specific characteristic, will account for over 40% of the territory. However, the mountain regions are sparsely populated – inhabited by only 5% of the Community’s population – which means that political pressure from that quarter is relatively ineffectual. It is therefore up to us to lend a hand. It must also be said that not all mountain regions are the same and that the reform of the Structural Funds, with the abolition of Objectives 5a and 5b, has created considerable confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Objective 2 is too all-embracing and too flexible, it includes too many items and lumps together the needs of regions which are essentially different. Simplification is not always the best path to take if the rigour of scientific accuracy is lost along the way. In the mountains, there are areas which have priorities common to us all. There has been an example of this just recently: it is in the mountains that we protect ourselves against floods and drought, by safeguarding water resources and territorial integrity. This is an example of how the mountain regions are directly relevant to the interests and needs of all.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, what can we do? Commissioner, we must have the courage to provide direct aid, with regard to which the rules governing state aid and competition must be made more flexible; we need to have the determination to safeguard man’s life and presence in the mountain regions as a guarantee of genuine cohesion; we also need to muster the courage to recognise this specific feature of Europe in practical terms, not just in words. How? Maybe by extending the application of Article 158 on islands to mountain regions too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Currently these areas have Objective 1 status. No other parts of Europe are as sparsely populated: they have an average of 4.4 inhabitants per square kilometre. EU regional policy has contributed to the development effort in these areas by improving competitiveness and encouraging entrepreneurship. The remoteness of peripheral areas causes high costs for marketing, trade, and transportation of goods and persons.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors should be taken into account when determining sufficient support levels. As a result of the Union's regional level of activities, Northern Finland and Sweden have developed innovative solutions in the fields of eLearning and eHealth, for example. Northern Finland can also act as an EU gateway to north-west Russia, with access to vast national resources and hence huge potential. Focusing cohesion policy on competitiveness by fostering economic development is welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it should not be forgotten that geographical handicaps often restrain development of the economy, production and hence employment. Northern parts of Finland and Sweden are in unquestionable need of EU regional support and the structural disadvantages of extremely sparsely populated areas should be recognised independently of GDP. In addition to the sparsely populated areas, many other areas suffer from exceptionally high unemployment rates and these should also benefit from common initiatives. If they are not eligible under other Structural Funds they should benefit from the renewed Objective 2 or other similar Community initiatives. I am very happy to note that Mr Barnier has spoken about an <span class="italic">a la carte</span> model for the renewed Objective 2. This is something which should be emphasised more in future. It is also very much welcomed by the Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Cohesion Fund is an invaluable tool in helping less well-off Member States catch up, particularly in the development of infrastructure networks and upgrading of water supplies, in order to contribute to the long-term sustainable development of disadvantaged regions. The enlargement countries will be greatly helped by simplification of the implementation rules. It is undeniable that there are still marked disparities in existing Member States and I therefore support the proposal for transitional funding arrangements for Community aid in existing Objective 1 areas post-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own peripheral Objective 1 region, after a number of years of cohesion funding to my country, the Committee on Petitions of this Parliament recently acknowledged that Third World-standard unsafe water supply existed in communities such as Carraroe in my own constituency. How could this happen? Whilst I acknowledge the argument for targeting major projects, when these projects skew funding away from Objective 1 areas, as has happened in my country, some pressure should be put on national governments to recognise their role and duty in the use of cohesion funding for balanced regional development. I realise this is a domestic issue, but it helps to point out a failure in the existing cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 80 billion surplus in structural cohesion funding would be better used if it were returned to Member States in order to specifically target the internal imbalances in disadvantaged regions struggling with poor water supply or poor road infrastructure. It could also fund other essential tools for job creation in areas where our agricultural and fishing industries are struggling to survive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Solidarity is one of these. It was thanks to solidarity that the principle of cohesion came to be enshrined in our treaties. According to this principle it is not possible to take any decision that would reinforce the position of stronger citizens, states or regions at the expense of weaker ones. This principle of cohesion has gained further relevance in the context of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth stating at the outset that the whole House is of the opinion that Objective 1 should remain unchanged, and that regions due to lose Objective 1 status as a result of enlargement should not lose their aid. If these regions were to be deprived of their aid they would be losing out in order to make aid available to the new Member States. Nobody wants that to happen. The statistical effect should not therefore be taken into account so as to retain Objective 1 as it stood. We must all help to support the incoming countries, in a spirit of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently witnessing a very significant change. Commissioner Barnier is well aware of it. In the draft of the new constitution there are references to economic, social and territorial cohesion. Consequently the question arises as to whether there will be a territorial policy or not. To put this another way, it is necessary to consider whether citizens resident in areas of low population density, mountain or island regions, and who therefore experience difficulty in competing with other Europeans on equal terms are to be covered by a Community territorial policy, regardless of their income.</p>
<p class="contents">The report I am presenting states that this should be the case. It argues that citizens resident in such areas ought to receive Community aid. This is indeed significant. It is important to bear in mind that when a farmer receives support under the common agricultural policy, that farmer is not required to declare his or her income. Similarly, when a company is awarded aid for research and development it is not required to declare its assets. It is all quite straightforward. The policy on research and development is in place, and so is the common agricultural policy. Aid is granted according to certain regulations. The same should apply to territories. It follows that territories should receive aid regardless of whether they are above or below a specific GDP threshold. I trust this will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report on the preparatory work of the Convention is unambiguous. In it we state that policy must not be merely economic, dealing with money. Neither should it be simply a policy on cohesion, intent on avoiding exclusion. It needs to be a policy on territorial cohesion. Mountain regions, regions with low population density and island regions must receive specific aid. I am confident that the Council, the Commission and the Commissioner will heed the report by this House rather than the report by Mr Sapir. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, I should like, first of all, to thank Parliament for this new debate on the future of cohesion policy. Of course, my thanks go both to your two rapporteurs, Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pomés Ruiz, to whom I have listened attentively, and to each and every one of you.</p>
<p class="contents">A new debate – and it will not be the last – is therefore being held in this House at an extremely important moment, because we are just a few months away from that enlarged, reunified Europe in which – and I say it again – the economic, social and territorial divisions and the inequalities will be even greater than at present. The Union will have one third as many additional citizens, one third as much additional territory, but only 5 to 6% as much additional wealth. That is the reality of the enlarged, reunified Europe that will come into being on 1 May next year.</p>
<p class="contents">That reality makes it necessary for us to ask ourselves about the policy which we are pursuing at the moment, and which I have the honour to be moving forward together with my colleagues Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou and Commissioner Fischler. We have to evaluate it objectively and lucidly and imagine what it will be like during the new period from 2007 to 2013 or 2011. The Commission will be presenting its proposals for that period in the context of its third progress report on cohesion, which I am currently in the process of preparing. Of course, at the same time the Commission has been thinking for some months now about the future financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise, in passing, the spirit in which we are working, and in which I have been working with you for the last four years, a spirit which is inspired by a desire for transparency. We do not have any hidden agenda. We do not have any cards up our sleeve when it comes to the Structural Funds for the next period. Since January 2001 the Commission has adopted and publicly presented – in the first instance before this House – several documents, including the one that is the subject of the report by Mr Mastorakis. In that second progress report, we set out the facts and figures, and we indicate certain directions for the future, without being so ambitious as to draw up a strategy for the future. That strategy will be contained in the third progress report on cohesion, which is planned for the end of this year. Since the forum on cohesion in May 2001, the Commission has been frankly and openly seeking contributions from Parliament and from your committees, but also from local authorities, from associations of elected representatives and from Member States. We have received many contributions, which are all available, in complete transparency, and are accessible via our website.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious, then, that we do not reject any proposal, any criticism or any debate. Mrs Miguélez Ramos mentioned just now the Sapir report, which I have had occasion to refer to somewhat critically, not because I disagree with the diagnosis that it makes of the European situation and of our need to increase our efforts regarding competitiveness, innovation, research and education, but because I disagree with its conclusions, and in particular – as you quite rightly pointed out, Mrs Miguélez Ramos – with the senseless idea of abolishing the tool of regional policy. That being the case, I am open to any constructive criticism. Just now Mrs Scallon herself mentioned a few ideas which I have taken note of. Cohesion policy is not a sacred cow that we do not have the right to disturb. On the contrary, over the past two years I have held an ongoing dialogue with Parliament, and in particular with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which will continue to be inspired, for another few weeks, by the work of Mr Luciano Caveri, to whom I paid tribute here yesterday in a different debate, and also with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control. All this has resulted in real proposals for reforms. Moreover, some of those reforms are already being implemented, even before the next programming period begins.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, even though we agree that cohesion policy needs revising, even revising somewhat radically, we do not agree that it should be abolished or renationalised. I do not want only half a policy on cohesion. Mr Karas was speaking just now about charity. Yet cohesion policy, solidarity policy, which is something that Europe can be proud of, and which was one of the best and most practical policies of the European Union, is not a policy of charity.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it a blank cheque to be sent to the poorest countries and regions. It is not merely a budgetary or fiscal transfer from one country to another. This policy is the expression of something else. It symbolises a certain concept of Europe. For me, as for many of you, ladies and gentlemen, that concept of Europe consists of more than just a supermarket. Cohesion policy ought to be symbolic. It is the proof of a community – and that word is important – a community of regions and of States which share with one another, while awaiting the day when it will become, I hope, a political power.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the opinion of Mr Markov, who was speaking just now about this concept of Europe. He talked about a real policy serving both the needs of convergence, where convergence is needed, especially in the regions that lag behind the most, and the needs of competitiveness for everyone, while at the same time acknowledging the fact that the regions exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the effectiveness of this policy has been emphasised by some Members, but it has also been criticised by others. I should like to thank Mrs Guy-Quint for reminding the House how important it is. By contrast, I disagree with Mr Korakas, who said that this policy was a failure.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures which I have, and which are at your disposal, do not prove that everything is perfect, but this policy has produced results for the four countries involved in cohesion. The GDP per head of population increased by ten points between 1988 and 2001, thanks to the efforts made by those countries but also thanks to European support. On the basis of the figures for the Objective 1 regions which have been sent to us by Member States, I see that the average wealth per head of population in those countries increased by six points between 1989 and 2001. These figures prove that this is a useful policy. Once again, we need to preserve it while at the same time renewing it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise the importance of the fact that the regions are a reality, and that this reality is relevant not only in terms of governance. In many regions, and particularly in Objective 1 regions, there has been progress in terms of partnership, parity, evaluation, programming and planning. That is what this cohesion policy brings with it: not just money, but also the modernisation of the way in which we work together and administer our affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">This regional reality is also relevant at economic and social level. Each territory has its own specific needs, and I am often astonished that anyone can deny that evidence. I should like to explain to Mrs Schroedter, who spoke earlier and called for the definition of a long-term strategy, that all this will lie at the centre of my thoughts and of those of my colleagues when we define our proposals in the third progress report on cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the main political lesson that I should like to draw from the examination of the reports by Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pomés Ruiz, in other words the agreement which unites our two institutions on the fundamental ambition of a policy for everyone, a policy that is territorial and visible and which serves the interests of Community priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have the time to go into detail regarding the proposals of your rapporteurs. I should simply like to mention, briefly, six points which to some extent constitute the backbone of any reform which we might, together, envisage and desire.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all there is the priority – which will be confirmed and accentuated – given to regions whose development is lagging behind. Naturally these least developed regions are concentrated in all the new Member States, but not only in those States. I should like to say to Mr Berend and to his neighbour Mr Cocilovo, to Mr Markov or to Mrs Wenzel-Perillo, that I shall find a fair, Community-based solution for those regions which will suffer from ‘statistical’ effects. At the moment I can envisage an Objective 1a which would respond to the special problems of those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is agreement on the need to support the competitiveness of the regions wherever such support is necessary, with a limited number of themed priorities which are related to, and create a synergistic effect with, the major European objectives set at Lisbon or Göteborg. On this subject, since I am talking about competitiveness in all the regions, I should like to say to Mr Duin that the new Objective 2, as I imagine it, will be well-targeted, and properly decentralised, towards the priority objectives of Göteborg and Lisbon. In other words, some of you have criticised the ‘sprinkling effect’ which is still allowed by this aspect of regional policy, on the basis of regulations or policies defined in Berlin. I believe that this ‘sprinkling effect’ should be limited, or even abolished, by targeting, in the context of the new Objective 2, if we retain it, the objectives and priorities of Lisbon. </p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, ladies and gentlemen, many of you are aware that in developed regions which are not lagging behind in their development, situations may develop which are sometimes, indeed often, extremely serious, sometimes tragic, and sometimes shameful, particularly in poorer areas, as a result of illegal immigration. This is also true as regards the industrial restructuring linked to the market as a whole, which may have a drastic effect on industrial areas. It also applies, sometimes, to disasters caused by the weather. Earlier, Mr Ferrández Lezaun referred, as I myself did yesterday evening, to what is happening in Portugal following the forest fires that have occurred there. It will be necessary to create jobs in those areas which have been entirely destroyed by fire, because, for the people who live there, if there is no forest there is no work. We are well aware, then, of the need for the European Union to show active solidarity in regions which are not necessarily covered by Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point on which we agree is the substantial strengthening of cooperation, which is also symbolic of the European Union, particularly as regards cross-border work and projects.</p>
<p class="contents">A fourth point which Mr Pomés Ruiz defined in his report concerns the territorial dimension of cohesion policy. Just now, Mr Pohjamo and Mrs Kauppi gave excellent descriptions of the real situation in the northern regions – which I have actually visited – in Sweden or in Finland. Mr Santini did the same for mountain regions. Moreover, Mr Santini, it is not necessary to explain to me what the situation is like in the mountains: for twenty years now I have been elected to represent a mountain region. As for Mr Segni, he spoke about islands. All this corresponds to the territorial realities in regions which have structural handicaps which mean that, in those regions, the success or even the implementation of Community policies is more difficult than elsewhere. We must therefore take this fact into account, perhaps in the way that Mr Hatzidakis suggested earlier, or by means of an amendment, by increasing the subsidy rate. Once again let me say that I am taking all these ideas into account, and in particular the proposals by Mr Pomés Ruiz. I am also aware of the fact that, when the new proposals are being drawn up, I shall have the support, not only of this House, but also of the new European Constitution. I have had the honour of taking part in the work of the Praesidium of the Convention, and I was very keen on the idea of introducing the concept of territorial cohesion into the European Constitution. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will retain it. This concept has just been added to the concept of, and need for, economic and social cohesion, a concept which it also reinforces.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last point on which we agree is that there should be a programming, management and control system that is simpler and more effective, so that people do not always call into question, as Mr Virrankoski did just now, the Brussels bureaucracy. I am well aware of the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that there are undoubtedly bureaucrats and technocracy in Brussels. However, if you look hard enough you will find bureaucracy in many other places apart from Brussels. If you find that there are difficulties in implementing the Structural Funds in your regions and in your countries, it is highly likely that the reasons for those difficulties lie partly in Brussels and in the complexities of Brussels. Yet they are also found in the Berlin regulations which I am responsible for applying. There are also objective reasons. I cannot submit accurate figures on the management of the Structural Funds or submit accounts – and accurate accounts at that – to Parliament and the Court of Auditors, unless I have the means of carrying out controls. </p>
<p class="contents">You are also well aware, however, that some of the difficulties are due to the complexity of the national management systems. We can, of course, simplify all that, and on this subject as well I am ready to propose substantial changes, including the submission of new ideas. Earlier, Mr Bradbourn criticised the idea of the tripartite contract. It is not a question of bypassing the nation states: the tripartite contract is an idea for bringing together, in the context of regional programming, Brussels, the national capital and the region. Those are the points on which I am able to signal my agreement, in addition, of course, though the time has not yet come to talk about it in detail, to the budgetary ambition which will make this policy a reality, with a credibility threshold which I have personally set at 0.45% of the Community GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many points that have been raised by one person or another, and even if I do not quote all of you, I have carefully taken note of your remarks. I shall end, therefore, by referring, as Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau and Mr Marques have done, to the special situation in the ultra-peripheral regions. Here again, I have ensured that the Commission reproduces, in its new Article 326, what is guaranteed under Article 299, and at the same time strengthens it. I have also noted the concern expressed by Mr Karas and Mr Esclopé, a concern which I share, about services of public interest and the question of whether they really exist, particularly in those regions which are in the greatest difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is my last word, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have another concern regarding my forthcoming presentation of the third progress report on cohesion: I hope that the debate will get off the ground very quickly, despite the European elections next year and the change in the Commission. Let us not lose too much time in reaching decisions based on the Commission proposals. What is at stake here really is very important. We must try to speed up the timetable so that regions and Member States know fairly quickly where they stand. If possible, they should be aware of the policies and the rules before the end of the current programming period. Negotiations with the regions will then be able to start before the end of 2006 and it will be possible to launch the implementation of projects and programmes in each of the regions, particularly in those that are in the greatest difficulty, as soon as the next programming period starts in 2007, and not two years later, which I observed to be the case after Berlin. We are not there yet, but it is a prospect that I was keen to point out to you.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, we have to carry on the debate, which is difficult because cohesion policy is being called into question and sometimes condemned. Personally, I shall never tire of explaining it and defending it in an open and constructive manner while at the same time accepting criticisms and proposals. In this spirit, I have paid close attention to the conclusions of your two rapporteurs and to the – generally speaking – constructive support shown by Parliament for this policy, a policy which is, and I say it again, one of the best and most practical policies of the European Union. It is not a policy of passive solidarity, but rather a policy of active solidarity which is a credit to the European Union.</p>
