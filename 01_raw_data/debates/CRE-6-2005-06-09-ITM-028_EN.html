Violent clashes between security forces and protestors, calling for economic reform and more rights for indigenous people, have been taking place in the streets of La Paz. The fear of escalating violence is growing by the day.</p>
<p class="contents">Such clashes should come as no surprise to anybody, since the causal factors have been in place for a long time. First, there exists a huge and unjust discrepancy in wealth distribution. Secondly, the indigenous population, peasants, and the long queues of the unemployed are largely excluded from economic and political life. Thirdly, about 85% of farmland is owned by only 15% of the population, and fourthly, although Bolivia is thought to have the second largest gas reserves in South America, this natural resource is not sufficiently used for the benefit of the people of Bolivia and is to a large extent taken advantage of by foreign multinationals and a small group of elite beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">All the above, and much more, has led to the potentially explosive situation that we see today. The resolution before you mainly calls for continued efforts to deepen and broaden democracy in Bolivia and urges the EU and its Member States adequately to support the government to bring about a peaceful and just solution and avert a catastrophe of looming civil war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The collapse of the State institutions, the absence of authority and the disorder reigning in La Paz, in particular, make us fear the worst, if the worst has not already happened.</p>
<p class="contents">But what has happened in Bolivia to bring the situation to such extremes? There are many reasons: a succession of bad governments, the failure of fundamentalist neo-liberal policies, the despair of the impoverished masses excluded from the system, the predatory behaviour of the multinationals and — we must accept as well — the lack of understanding — or even worse, the indifference — of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that, today, Bolivia is a failed, ungovernable and profoundly unstable State whose situation may get even worse, making any solution more difficult and more costly.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in La Paz and Santa Cruz de la Sierra just a month ago, sent by the Spanish Government to assess the situation and to propose possible initiatives. Having re-read the report that I wrote, I regret that things have evolved in the way I predicted, but I do not deserve credit for that, I was not being a visionary; it was already obvious, as it was two years previously, that Bolivia was heading for the abyss.</p>
<p class="contents">On that visit, neither amongst the traditional parties nor the so-called ‘emerging parties’ nor amongst practically any of the political leaders did I find the least shred of a sense of direction for the State nor any lucid or generous analysis of what may be good for the country. All of them, or almost all of them, were calculating what was best for them personally: electing a constituent parliament, prefect elections in the nine departments of the country, a referendum on the emerging autonomous areas such as Santa Cruz de la Sierra ...</p>
<p class="contents">At that time I only came across one fundamental exception: the President himself, Carlos Mesa, whom I found to be a man with good intentions, who is trying to find solutions by means of dialogue and negotiation. But he was, and still is, a lone man, without a party, without parliamentary support, faced with a multifaceted opposition that were demanding contradictory solutions from him. At that point his only asset was high popularity and an unquestionable domination of television communications. Since he was willing — and he has stood by his word — not to put down demonstrations and street protests, the pickets of the most radical parties and unions took over the streets and forced him to resign. Furthermore, they have denied the Presidents of the Senate and of the Congress access to the presidency, though constitutionally they should be the successors to a resigned Mr Mesa, and have forced the President of the Supreme Court, the third in the order of succession, to become Head of State, but only so that general elections may be called in three months time.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, Mr President, that may be the only and the best democratic solution. But not because of the demands and calculations of the most radical factions, not because that would give the citizens back their rightful role which has been seized from them in the street, because ‘the street ’ has been taken over by minority sectors that do not have the support of the immense majority of the 10 million people of Bolivia.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the international community doing in the meantime? Not much. The issue has therefore been raised in this Parliament: the European Union must be a global player; the European Union and its Member States are the main investors in development aid to Bolivia. Because we want governability and stability for Bolivia and because our interests are at stake, the Council must instruct its Ambassadors to ensure that Bolivia can find a peaceful, democratic and free solution. Never again must Bolivia's wealth, such as silver, rubber or wood, be channelled abroad or towards an internal élite, rather than being used for the benefit of the Bolivian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Fernández, when it is a case of speakers delivering a speech on behalf of their group, their order of speaking is decided on according to the size of the groups: hence, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, followed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and so on. When it is a case of giving the floor to authors or of debating resolutions, the sequence is decided on according to the chronological order in which the requests to speak have been submitted. It is therefore not a case of belonging to the largest group, but of being the quickest.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to your question regarding Monday evening, the order of the three groups was: the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The PPE was not on the podium. That being said, there will be no problem with you, in your turn, taking the floor. I would remind you that it is a practice that is as old as our Assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have been aware for some time that broad sectors of civil society, in particular the indigenous people, peasants, workers and the unemployed, have been marginalised from the country's political and economic life. But we in Europe cannot act as if what is happening there had nothing to do with us. Twenty-six of the recently privatised companies are in foreign hands, many of them European, but that has not helped to resolve the crisis and has not given the population greater access to gas and water.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that we in the European Union are constantly supporting privatisation processes in Latin America within international bodies, without any guarantees that the minimum principles of corporate social responsibility will be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">So what happens? Companies receive credits, they invest, they want to make money, but when there are mobilisations by local groups that have been excluded or due to price rises resulting from privatisation, the European companies then decide to leave and furthermore demand compensation for it, which aggravates the crisis even further.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, if the European Union wants to retain a degree of credibility as a supporter of human rights in the world, it must investigate the actions of energy companies of European origin in Bolivia and in other places, and must be much more demanding in terms of compliance with the social responsibility rules by companies investing abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also alarmed at the attempts at separatism on the part of certain economic interests in Santa Cruz, which are seeking to monopolise the country’s energy resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As such we hope that Bolivian society can reach a consensus whereby the management control of the country’s natural resources, especially the energy and water resources, can be returned to State hands and can contribute towards its development and towards the people’s well-being. We also hope that the ruling by the Constitutional Court can be implemented, which stated that certain energy conventions signed by the previous government with multinational companies were illegal, given that they had not been submitted for consultation to the Bolivian Parliament. Similarly, the perpetrators of the massacres of October 2003 must be brought to book and we urge the Organisation of American States to take precautionary measures on behalf of the leaders of the social movement who have been threatened, such as Evo Morales and Abel Mamami.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly we call on the Member States to take action within the international institutions, and at bilateral level, with a view to cancelling Bolivia’s foreign debt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Governmental Palace, the home of the Presidency of the Republic, is known by the Bolivians as the ‘burnt palace’. It has been burnt down several times during the many popular uprisings in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposite the Palace, in the Plaza de Armas de La Paz, there is a bust of President General Gualberto Villarroel, who was murdered, hung from a lamppost, in 1943 during one of the many insurrections that have taken place there. Fortunately, according to the information I received just half an hour ago, the presidential palace has not so far suffered any damage and the resigning President has just made a dramatic call to avoid bloodshed and civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is my duty to acknowledge, on behalf of my group, that President Mesa has honoured his commitment never to use violence to put down protest movements and I regret that such an exceptional attitude, which is so unusual in a country with a history such as that of Bolivia, has not been reciprocated by the opposition leaders who, in my opinion, have been overcome by events and whose statements over recent hours have become more radical.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment, in Bolivia, power is in the streets. At a time when the legislators are meeting in Sucre, because it has not been possible to access the Congress building in the capital, La Paz, due to the blockades, the foreign embassies have mobilised their emergency plans for evacuating the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, when we are getting ready to vote and to approve the resolution supporting the Bolivians and calling for respect and supporting the institutions and the constitutional laws, it only remains for me to call on God and on the Quechuan and Aymaran Gods to enlighten their leaders and to bless and protect the Bolivian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Arriving in the La Paz basin, one is immediately struck by the glaring discrepancy between the beauty of the country and the incredible depression that hangs over the people. Someone once described Bolivia as ‘a beggar on a golden throne’, a throne at one time mainly founded upon ore, gold and other minerals, but now, increasingly, upon crude oil and natural gas. In view of the obvious risk that the country could become helpless in the hands of political and economic powers, we are of course obliged to do what we can to help keep it stable. Its neighbours include such major countries as Brazil, in respect of which my colleague Mr Deß has done such exemplary work by ensuring that measures are taken to ensure stability, particularly for agriculture, small-scale farmers and independent farms, along with the slow growth of a small business sector. This is the approach we must take in Bolivia too, or else the country faces the threat of disintegration, with all the resultant consequences for the political map of Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we must work with all the means at our disposal towards a peaceful transition by way of new elections monitored by the international community, but above all towards the country’s speedier recovery, which will involve strengthening small farmers and small and medium-sized businesses, failing which the country, long at the mercy of conglomerates and conspiracies, risks generating conflicts that would suck its neighbours, including Brazil – particularly its Mato Grosso state – into their maelstrom. It is for that reason that this House needs to finalise a strategy for Latin America. Our Christian Europe forged the two continents of North and South America; there may one day be a bitter price to pay for our present neglect of the latter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the European Commission is extremely concerned about the critical political situation in Bolivia. We are following the situation very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Many countries in the Andean region have faced serious political and institutional crises in recent years, but events in Bolivia have shown it to be a particularly fragile and vulnerable state, not least because it is one of the poorest, least-developed and most unequal South American countries. The current increasingly anarchic climate, which culminated in Monday evening’s resignation of President Carlos Mesa, is deeply worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">At this delicate moment the Commission urges all Bolivian citizens, rich and poor, of all ethnic origins and from all regions of the country, to pursue their respective demands and aspirations peacefully, by means of dialogue, within the framework of democracy and the rule of law and in accordance with the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we are relieved to note that up to now, as far as we are informed, there have been few injuries during the recent unrest, it is now absolutely vital that Bolivia’s political leaders and civil society work together to extricate their country from its current difficulties in a spirit of peace, dialogue, tolerance and national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The histories of both Europe and Latin America show that violence or non-democratic solutions do nothing to bring lasting peace or prosperity to their citizens. Their heartfelt but often conflicting demands and aspirations can only be tackled successfully by working together to generate consensus and unity. In that regard, the Commission hopes that the efforts of the Catholic church to organise a national dialogue and ensure a smooth constitutional succession will continue and will be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been making a real and practical contribution to supporting dialogue in Bolivia by using our rapid reaction mechanism to provide up to EUR 185 000 to the Club of Madrid to implement a six-month programme of high-level consultancy and support for consensus building and strengthening of leadership skills, which started in mid-April and will continue in the run-up to the long-awaited constituent assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council have also worked in close collaboration to prepare an EU action plan for Bolivia, which was adopted in mid-May. It provides a framework for coherent and structured common action by EU institutions and by the Member States jointly and individually. The action includes engaging in constructive political dialogue, providing support for the constituent assembly, respect for the rights of indigenous peoples, exchanges of experience with different models of regional autonomy and providing constructive input and the benefit of EU experience in securing the benefits of foreign investment for all Bolivians.</p>
<p class="contents">Bolivia has also been included in the list of eligible countries for the European initiative on democracy and human rights for 2005-2006. In the Bolivian context, projects related to training, monitoring and consciousness-raising in the fields of democracy and human rights, projects that promote the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples and projects that support the role of civil society in conflict prevention are all eligible for support. There is, unfortunately, only limited scope for such support to be implemented while Bolivia is gripped by its present crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament, which would underline the need for full respect for democracy and the rule of law and would add a further very important EU voice to the calls for dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
