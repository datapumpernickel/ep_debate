These reports were adopted before lunch today by the European Commission. With the adoption and publication of the accession country reports, we are now one significant step nearer to the creation of a truly continental-scale European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are entering the final stage of a process which began with such inspiration almost thirteen years ago with the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Our Member States and not just the accession states must individually and collectively summon up the necessary political will to overcome the last remaining obstacles. In this House we are determined to use our best endeavours to ensure that insofar as we can make a contribution, this House will contribute to the removal of any remaining obstacles between now and the Copenhagen Summit in December.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This enlargement represents for Europe an extraordinary and unparalleled act of reconciliation, healing and opportunity. It is the first time in millennia in our old continent that, by the free wills of free and sovereign people, we will be coming together neither forced at the point of a sword nor through the barrel of a gun nor any other oppressive force but by the use of reason, conviction and shared values. Today's debate is an important staging-post in this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to pay a tribute to the European Commission and its services and to all of those in leadership positions and in the public services of accession states who have engaged in such extraordinary work of transformation. The Commission will remain central to the management of this exercise right to the end. We are coming to a time when we, the political class, must undertake our political responsibilities to reach out to our publics in terms of the calculus of consent.</p>

<p class="contents">When I took office, I made a commitment – before this very House – to make enlargement the top priority of my Commission, to make my Commission the Commission of enlargement, because in enlarging the European Union we will be consolidating an area of peace, security and democracy throughout the European continent. Three years later, I am standing here before you once again to tell you that this commitment has been honoured. The Commission has done its job and kept its promise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has carried out a careful study of the progress made by the candidate countries and I can now announce the names of the countries with which we recommend the Council should conclude negotiations by the end of 2002. I will now, if I may, read out the key points of the recommendations we adopted today.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia fulfil the political criteria. Bearing in mind the progress achieved by these countries, the track record in implementing their commitments, and taking into account their preparatory work in progress and foreseen, the Commission considers that these countries will have fulfilled the economic and acquis<span class="italic"> </span>criteria and will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004. The Commission therefore recommends to conclude the accession negotiations with these countries by the end of this year with the aim to sign the Accession Treaty in spring 2003.’</p>
<p class="contents">In view of Bulgaria's and Romania's progress over the last year, the Commission notes the date – 2007 – that those countries have set themselves for accession. The Commission will do everything necessary to ensure that this objective can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Through constitutional reform and a series of legislative packages, Turkey has made considerable progress as regards the Copenhagen criteria. However, further efforts are needed. The Commission is therefore recommending that the European Union give more support and allocate more resources to Turkey's pre-accession preparations. To this end, the Commission will propose a revised Accession Partnership and step up legislative scrutiny. Turkey is encouraged to pursue its reform process and so advance its candidacy for European Union membership.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentleman, just 13 years ago, Berlin was still divided by the wall of shame. The wall has been pulled down and Germany has been reunified. This re-establishment of freedom has allowed us to restore the historical unity of the peoples of Europe. Our common destiny is once again to build a common future, a future built on the fundamental values we share of peace, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1993, the Copenhagen European Council offered the countries of Central and Eastern Europe the chance to join the European Union. Since then, these countries have gone through a huge process of change, moving peacefully from dictatorship to stable, participatory democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Their achievements are extraordinary. In the space of a decade, we have seen the holding of dozens of transparent, democratic national, regional and local elections, the adoption of thousands of laws and regulations giving shape to the new democracies and incorporating the Community acquis into national law, the training of tens of thousands of civil servants and magistrates to interpret and apply the new legislation and the participation of hundreds of thousands of elected officials, specialists and members of professional organisations in EU-financed training and cooperation projects in order to learn about our policies. All 12 countries satisfy the political criteria laid down at Copenhagen and democratic institutions are stronger everywhere. Lastly, the overall performance of the economies of the ten first-wave countries is gradually improving: their growth rates are higher than ours, their inflation rates and deficits are being managed and kept under control and direct foreign investment is flooding in. This proves that the markets have confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we adopted today also highlights the remaining deficiencies in some sectors, for some countries. These failings have to be remedied before accession: the Commission will work with the authorities of these countries to ensure that the problems are resolved in good time. Our concerns continue to be centred on the administrative capacity of these countries and their justice systems, which are undermined by a lack of financial and, above all, human resources. We have endeavoured to address these problems through a EUR 250 million support programme. This programme is starting to bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">Another weakness we have identified is inadequate preparation for implementation of the acquis in a number of crucial areas, namely customs services, taxation, veterinary and plant-health controls, the institutions managing and supervising agricultural policy and, lastly, the departments in charge of managing and controlling the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention a further two extremely serious problems: the corruption affecting many of these countries, with a few exceptions, and the shameful issue of the trafficking of human beings. This does not mean that nothing has been done in these fields. On the contrary, a great deal has been achieved already and the operation is almost complete in some countries. However, our report stresses the scrupulous monitoring the Commission has undertaken to conduct up until accession. We shall publish a final evaluation six months before the date of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">To cope with the complexities of enlargement, the Commission will take all the necessary measures to reorganise its departments, increasing monitoring and support for the new Member States after accession and providing pre-accession aid for the countries that will follow those covered by today’s recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our objective is still to sign the Accession Treaty in spring 2003. We are therefore entering the final stages of the process. In this regard, the Commission hopes that the Brussels European Council of 24 and 25 October will take the necessary decisions on the chapters still open, namely agriculture, financial issues and institutions. In this way, we can negotiate and conclude these chapters before Copenhagen. As regards Bulgaria and Romania, the Commission will put forward proposals for an enhanced pre-accession strategy in good time for adoption by the Copenhagen Council. Then for Turkey, which does not yet meet the accession criteria, the Commission will propose an enhanced pre-accession strategy with extra financial resources in the new year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Nice is still crucial and cannot be sidestepped. I therefore place my confidence in the Irish electorate, which will be voting on the Treaty again in a few days. I hope that the achievement of the historic objective of unifying our continent will not be jeopardised by this vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let me focus on the issue of Cyprus. Let us hope for real progress towards reunification of the island, even though the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council do not make it a precondition for entry. The Commission wants a reunited Cyprus to join the EU and believes this is the best solution for all. In recommending that the Council conclude negotiations speedily with Cyprus, the Commission is issuing a fresh appeal to the parties concerned to work towards reunification of the island. We call upon everyone to support the process now under way under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General so that a solution can be found before the year's end. The Seville European Council has already affirmed that the European Union ‘would accommodate the terms of such a comprehensive settlement in the Treaty of Accession in line with the principles on which the European Union is founded.’</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, all too often, I hear talk about the risks and costs of enlargement. I believe we can and must discuss this calmly and openly, for the costs have been analysed in detail and they are in line with the resources available. However, we should also – and above all – be telling the public about the benefits of enlargement, which are stability in Europe, unification of an artificially divided continent and the creation of the biggest single market in the world. Enlargement will unite us with economies that have lower incomes than the present Member States but which have greater growth potential. The situation was exactly the same in 1985, when the accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal were concluded. Now, nobody could doubt the validity and farsightedness of that decision, although at the time it was controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is the new front line of the European project. It will give impetus to trade, investment, education and research. And to economic growth. As regards the costs of enlargement, we know that they are sustainable until 2006 because they are included in the Berlin financial perspective. I shall not hide the fact that the accession of ten countries will entail a significant financial burden, within the framework I have described, but this will be more than fully offset by the benefits brought by the consolidation of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is not just about economics, however. It is important primarily for political and ethical reasons. Enlargement is the culmination of the process of European integration: the process that has given us half a century of peace and prosperity must be extended to the whole continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Consider the recent events in the Balkans, where there have been thousands of deaths, whole communities have been forced to flee as refugees and entire cities have been destroyed. Enlargement is our political masterpiece since it will prevent such things happening. From this broader and more accurate perspective, the cost of enlargement is very slight compared with the cost of non-enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming months, we need to conduct a realistic and positive information campaign. We must touch the hearts and minds of our citizens. Enlargement has been made possible by great determination, tremendous political courage and a farsighted vision of history. Moreover, it will be a test of our commitment to our principles, for accession will force us to change as well as bringing big changes for the new Member countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the task of the Convention. The institutional reforms that come out of it will have to be just as courageous and farsighted as our endeavours have been. It must be understood that, without radical, intelligent reform of the institutions, the success of enlargement could turn out to be unsustainable. Indeed, the new Europe needs a clear, stable geographical shape and institutional framework that all our citizens can understand. In other words, the time has come for a European constitution. A constitution that guarantees the rights of all the citizens and the role of the Member States. A constitution that preserves cultural and linguistic diversity whilst reinforcing solidarity. A constitution that completes the creation of a democratic European Union, a genuine union of peoples and States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by looking beyond the impending enlargement, beyond its historical and geographical limits. We are inviting the new countries to join our Union because we want peace and stability across the whole continent. However, this process must not result in new barriers being erected just when we are trying to break down the old ones. We must keep this in mind when building new relations with our neighbours after enlargement. Here, I am thinking of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. They will be the new neighbours of the enlarged Union, which will one day extend to the Balkans region too.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing on our new European neighbours, however, should not make us any less receptive to the ever-increasing expectations of the Mediterranean countries, expectations that we have not yet managed to fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of European integration that started half a century ago has earned us the admiration and respect of the entire world. We alone are building a genuine, practical model for managing globalisation, if only across our continent. This globalisation is a democratic globalisation with a human dimension, a globalisation in which all citizens have an equal role. Our enlargement is an example to the whole world and a visionary act: it unites the whole continent for the first time and it makes us protagonists of history once more.</p>

There is only one justification for our recommendation today – the ten countries have earned it! The ten countries have succeeded, through their own efforts, in meeting the incredibly difficult and challenging criteria for accession to the European Union. I attach great importance to the comment that the Commission did not see it as its task to justify a desirable political accession scenario 'after the fact'.</p>
<p class="contents">What we did see as our task was to provide you, the Members of the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States, with neutral and objective information showing which countries are ready and prepared for accession and the conditions under which this will take place. The progress reports were not produced on the basis of political stipulations. The Commission staff were given just one instruction: they were not to conceal, omit or prettify anything, and they were to indicate clearly where problems still exist. In our reports, we identify the problems by name. However, the key point here is that we have not identified a single problem which could not be solved by the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Please do not be misled by the sometimes very critical tone. Of course, the issues which have still to be resolved must be put into the context of what has already been achieved, and if we look at what has been achieved in the accession countries over the last ten years in the transformation process and the preparations for accession, I must say that the progress made by the people in these countries is a truly magnificent and historic achievement which deserves our greatest respect.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has developed a methodology which allows us to determine, as precisely as possible, where we are and what has still to be done. The Commission has also made a number of proposals concerning the ongoing monitoring of the commitments undertaken and the introduction of a safeguard clause in the Accession Treaty. Let me explain this in a little more detail. First of all, I must point out that our recommendation naturally contains something of a prognostic element. After all, the new Member States are not obliged to meet the criteria for membership today; they must do so at the time of accession. In other words, what we have to do today is to assess whether the remaining tasks can be completed within the timeframe. This assessment is not based on a feeling or mood; it is based on sound knowledge of the pace and quality of the preparation process in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to apply all the tried and tested monitoring instruments<span class="italic"> </span>after the conclusion of the negotiations and the conclusion of the Treaty, in order to ensure that all the commitments undertaken are fulfilled. We propose that for the first two years after accession, an entirely new clause should be introduced into the Treaty, one which has never appeared in any other enlargement treaty to date. This clause will ensure that rapid and targeted measures can be taken if it becomes apparent, within the first two years of accession, that the internal market is disrupted in any area, or if policies are not working properly in any area relating to the internal market. In this context, the phrase 'internal market' should be interpreted in the broadest possible terms; in other words, it relates to all policies with a cross-border dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that this clause is necessary because the candidate countries pose a risk – they do not. I believe that this clause is necessary because this enlargement is quite unlike any other we have previously experienced and – if we are honest – we cannot tell precisely which adjustment problems are likely to occur within the first two years. This is why it is necessary to have an instrument enabling us to respond quickly and flexibly. I also think it is necessary in terms of the public debate in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we get to the stage of being able to welcome Members from ten new countries to our plenary here, several important steps must be taken. First of all, the Treaty of Nice must be ratified, and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the voters of Ireland and ask them to consider, when they make their decision, that what is at stake here is the European future of nations in Europe. What is at stake is the European future of nations which did not voluntarily dissociate themselves from the European unification process, but which were forced to do so, which were forced to live separated from us behind the Iron Curtain, and which now wish to belong, once and for all, to the family of democratic nations in Europe</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at the European Council meeting in Brussels in a few days' time, the Member States must come to an agreement on the common negotiating positions which are still open. I was a little concerned, when returning from the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday, about the complete lack of movement there. The Member States too must now be urged to show the necessary flexibility and willingness to compromise. If the timeframe is to be adhered to, we need to reach an agreement in Brussels on the financial package and institutional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the candidate countries must continue their work and continue their efforts. In doing so, they will undoubtedly be heartened by the Commission's recommendations today and by our debate here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a few words about Bulgaria and Romania. I am gratified by the progress made by these two countries. We did not decide that Bulgaria and Romania would not be included in the first round of enlargements. It is their own decision. They said that they wanted to be part of the process in 2007, and all the commitments which they have undertaken during the negotiations relate to 2007, not 2004. The Commission solemnly pledges to do all it can to help these two countries achieve this goal. The current enlargement process will not be complete until Bulgaria and Romania also have Members representing them in this House.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me comment briefly on Turkey as well. I take issue with the people who say that the Helsinki strategy was a mistake. On the contrary, it is apparent that since the Helsinki strategy came into effect around 18 months ago, Turkey has made more progress on human rights, democracy and the rule of law during these 18 months than in the previous five decades. We should – and we do – recognise this fact.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Turkey, however, could not be expected to fulfil all the political criteria for entry to the accession negotiations within these 18 months. I do not wish to imply any criticism of Turkey when I say that it has not yet fulfilled all the criteria. On the contrary, I think it is remarkable that Turkey has achieved so much in such a short time. This is why Turkey must be encouraged to continue along this road, and the Commission will put forward suitable proposals to ensure that Turkey can continue along this road and the door remains open for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not be distracted from the real task, however, namely to reform the country in such a way that it is ready for EU accession. Let us not be distracted from this task, and let us not enter into a fruitless statistical debate whose outcome is bound to be unproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's outcomes will be received in many countries of Europe with great interest, excitement and hope. Our task now is to ensure that Europe's citizens do not just understand but wholeheartedly endorse and welcome this project. There is still considerable scepticism surrounding this issue in many Member States, and this should not take us unawares. My impression is that the scepticism is often greatest in those areas where there is a serious lack of information. It is extremely important to ensure, over the coming months, that we supply people with information, information and more information and enable them to use the range of information productively. If this does not take place, we may have a very, very nasty surprise in a whole range of countries just as enlargement becomes the central issue on the domestic agenda, if people turn round to us – after the Treaty is concluded, at the very latest – and say: 'Why weren't we told about this? Why did you do this without us?' Involving the citizens is the key task facing us now.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the train that began its journey in Helsinki is now only two stations from its destination. It is very gratifying indeed that it has been possible to push ahead with the Commission’s progress report to such an extent that it has appeared a month earlier than last year’s, and it is also gratifying that we now have a complete basis for making decisions as to which countries are ready to conclude the enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, I should like to thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for the commitment and the energy they have shown right from the start in carrying out this historic task. I followed their efforts from my position here in Parliament as soon as they took up their offices. It has been a pleasure to note and observe their commitment, which also shines through here in Parliament today.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been given an objective account of the candidate countries’ level of preparation. The Commission has come to the view that ten countries are ready to conclude the negotiations. They fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, and it is considered that, before the date of accession in 2004, they will be able to fulfil the economic criterion, as well as the criterion of being able to implement the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. On certain points, there is a need for further efforts with regard to administrative capacity, and the Commission proposes that consideration continue to be given to the candidate countries’ preparations for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation to conclude the negotiations with ten countries is to be debated at the Brussels European Council in 14 days’ time, and discussions regarding the final decision are to take place at the Copenhagen European Council in two months’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission, Bulgaria and Romania have made good progress since the last reports, but are still not so far forward that the negotiations can be concluded. As is well known, it was decided in Seville that special efforts should be made on behalf of these two countries, and a decision on this matter too needs to be made in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes that Turkey has made great progress towards fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria. This is a gratifying development that must be maintained. It is also noted that there is still some way to go, and Turkey is therefore being encouraged to carry out further reforms and to implement reforms already adopted so that it continues to improve its prospects of membership. With regard to the Seville conclusions, Copenhagen will be the decisive moment in the development of the relationship between the EU and Turkey. In the run-up to the Brussels European Council, we must not now pre-empt the decisions to be made in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Cyprus, the Commission fully supports the EU’s efforts. The Commission calls upon all the parties involved, and Turkey in particular, to take active steps to bring about a solution before the conclusion of Cyprus’s negotiations for accession to the EU. The conclusions from the Helsinki European Council still form the point of departure for adopting a position on the issue of Cyprus’s accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to endorse what the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have said about the Irish vote, and I want to concur with the words of the President of the Commission about the risks and costs of <span class="italic">not</span> enlarging the EU, for the risks and costs of non-enlargement are much greater. That, of course, was why the track was laid in Helsinki. That is why the train is now travelling on towards peace, democracy and prosperity throughout our continent. The next station is Brussels and the last station is Copenhagen. The Danish train drivers are ready, and the whistle has sounded today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate since it concerns the greatest challenge facing the European Union, namely the accession of ten countries in a first round of enlargement. I therefore find it especially regrettable that the substance of today's debate was revealed in the European press some days ago, and I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to ensure that in future, Parliament is informed first, and then the European public. I think this is the right way round if a debate like this is to be meaningful.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding this criticism, however, which is meant very seriously, I would like to say a word of thanks to the Commission: to its President, Romano Prodi, to the Commissioner responsible, Günter Verheugen, but also to the previous Commission under Jacques Santer, together with Commissioner Hans van den Broek, for after all, the present Commission did not start from scratch; it built on the work begun by the Santer Commission. I would like to voice my warm thanks to all concerned for their great work.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are in broad agreement with the conclusions and also with the listing of the ten countries recommended for accession by the Commission, but there is a massive amount of work ahead of us. The accession countries – as has been stated, and for which we express our great respect – after 50 years of communism, communist mismanagement, communist tyranny and dictatorship, have made massive efforts, and this deserves the greatest credit and our greatest respect. However, there is still a massive amount of work to be done, not only by the accession candidates but also by the European Union itself. I think that what is important now is to ensure that we do not shatter the confidence vested in us by the accession countries. Anyone who now sets new accession conditions for the Central European countries, Malta and Cyprus – for example, by demanding reform of the European agricultural policy first of all – anyone who demands this is sinning against the accession countries, because it undermines their confidence in the European Union and its pledges. This is why we must now honour the confidence vested in us by the accession countries and not impose any new conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is without doubt the most important accession country, for its population – almost 39 million – is larger than in the other nine candidate countries. We must also remember today that this great transformation in Europe would not have been possible without Poland, without Solidarity – and let me also say this, lest we forget – without the great intellectual power of the Pole who occupies the papal throne, John Paul II, who told the Polish people: 'Don't be afraid!' This was the basis of Europe's intellectual and political transformation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must never forget this! It was also the basis on which Germany could be united twelve years ago. Without Poland, this would not have been possible. We therefore hope that at the negotiations, Poland will be able – also in the coming weeks and months – to master the difficult problems still arising in the accession process, and we support the Commission with its proposals on direct payments.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several unresolved questions to which we would welcome answers from the Czech Government. What is the Czech Government's position on the question whether, for example, legislation still exists in the Czech Republic which does not treat all persons in the European Union equally? Is there discrimination here? It would be helpful if the Czech Government provided an answer to this question. We hope that Bulgaria and Romania, which are not part of this enlargement round, will continue to make progress so that we can close negotiations with these two countries within a foreseeable timeframe as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the Commission's position in declining to give Turkey a date for the start of negotiations. On behalf of our group, I would like to point out that we have divergent views on the issue of Turkish membership of the European Union. It is important to state this clearly, and it is the same in other groups. However, we are united in our view that Turkey is a key strategic partner for us, and that we must always maintain our links with that country in a close and well-functioning partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the problem with Kaliningrad, and I recommend, as a matter of urgency, that in overcoming this difficult problem, we prioritise the issue of security, and also Lithuania's sovereignty, which we must not call into question. On this basis, flexible arrangements with Russia must be found. I also warn against the creation of a new Iron Curtain, for example between Poland and Ukraine; in the region around Lviv in Poland and in other areas, there are close regional and family ties with Ukraine and we must arrive at flexible arrangements which guarantee security but also enable people to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission referred to the Mediterranean region. I have just visited Morocco, and there is great concern there that as a result of enlargement, we Europeans will forget about the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean region is our neighbour just as much as the accession countries in the heart of Europe, and I recommend that we take our cooperation with the Mediterranean as seriously as we take our relations with Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If twenty years ago, someone had asked: 'We are offering you the chance for Poland and other countries to join the European Union – what are you prepared to pay for this?' We would have been willing to pay any financial price at all, and so I say to you: Let us all be happy that today, the accession of Poland and the other countries to the European Union, to our community of values, to democracy, the rule of law and a social market economy is possible, and let us welcome our colleagues warmly when, as we hope, they are elected to this House at the next European elections in 2004. This is a great day for Europe, for we have a shared and, it is to be hoped, a good future ahead for our European continent.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission's proposals which have been outlined today. Today is an historic occasion. In many ways it marks another stage down the road begun by Willy Brandt when he was mayor of Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">Before dwelling on the historic nature of today, I would like to acknowledge that it has only been possible to get where we are thanks to the determination of the Commission. When President Prodi launched the new fast-track method of negotiation, it radically changed the enlargement negotiations. I would also like to pay tribute to Commissioner Verheugen, who has pursued his brief with great determination and with a unique ability to master the detail while holding on to the big picture. He has also been a model of transparency and openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is first and foremost a security issue. It is about admitting countries to a political and economic system which has brought peace, stability and prosperity to countries which spent much of modern history trying to destroy each other. In our discussions about the details, we must not lose sight of that fact. We have it in our power to reunite Europe and to create a genuinely Europe-wide Union dedicated to building stability and prosperity, not only for its own citizens, but also beyond its borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Inevitably, as enlargement approaches reality, the voices of doubters are beginning to be heard. Some say enlargement is too costly. To those I would point out that in the period of 2000 to 2006, we will spend one thousandth of one percent of the EU's GDP on the candidate countries. We will spend ten percent of what Germany has spent on its reunification. What we spend is a fraction of the cost of defending Western Europe during the Cold War.</p>
<p class="contents">The real question is – what is the cost if we do not enlarge the European Union? What will it cost in terms of the social, political and economic dislocation which will inevitably follow? Some say they are in favour of enlargement but not yet. They say we must wait for the reform of this or that policy. But politics is not like that. We do not sit around waiting for perfection. Enlargement is a dynamic process which itself will drive forward the process of reform within the EU. Enlargement is actually the solution to the problems which concern our voters – the concerns about crime and drugs, about the environment, about jobs and a better future for our children. We have a window of opportunity to enlarge. If we miss this moment, it will be lost for a generation and the cause of reform will be lost with it. Enlargement and reform go side-by-side.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to underestimate the very serious issues that must be addressed. The core of the EU is the Single Market and there can be no weakening of it. There can be no question of admitting countries that cannot or will not enforce the <span class="italic">aquis </span>in this area, particularly in relation to state aids, competition policy and respect for intellectual property. There can be no question of admitting countries whose judicial system is corrupt or inept, or whose administrative capacity is not up to the task ahead. There can be no question of admitting countries unable or unwilling to take effective action to combat crime or the traffic of people and drugs. That is why I welcome the safeguards that the Commission has announced. I welcome in particular the economic safeguards in relation to the internal market which we have never had before, and also the commitment to have a further progress report six months before the date of accession. If there are problems then, we and the Council must have the courage of our convictions to act effectively in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, serious issues to be addressed in relation to agriculture. Firstly, there have been profound delays in the implementation of SAPARD. Money must be spent before accession to strengthen structures in the rural areas and to avoid a rural exodus and mass unemployment. The central eastern-European countries will have problems co-financing SAPARD because they will have to incorporate budget resources which they had set aside for 2000-2001 into their budgets for 2002-2003. Therefore, the Commission must take appropriate measures to ensure that SAPARD funds are not lost because of late implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The agricultural sector and the interests of the rural population are important to both the EU and the candidate countries. That is why we need a balanced solution to financing agriculture which does not offload the costs onto the weakest. Therefore, we strongly support the proposals Commissioner Fischler made in January because they are fully compatible with the Berlin Agreements and the roadmap for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In discussing further reform in the CAP, we must ensure that the accession countries are involved in an advisory capacity as soon as possible. We must have reform before Agenda 2000 runs out in 2006. Reforms, however, cannot be a further hurdle to concluding accession negotiations, just as enlargement should not hold up the reform of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former chairman of the Lithuanian JPC, I must raise the issue of Kaliningrad. I would urge that we find a solution which is deliverable for the Lithuanians and does not drive them into the 'no' camp.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is not the end of a process. Today is, hopefully, the beginning of the end of a process. We must scrutinise the path forward very closely. We must remember that no other enlargement has been as well-prepared as this one has, but we must seize this moment in history to make progress. I would like to call upon the inspiration of the late, great Elvis Presley at this moment – it is now or never, tomorrow is too late.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, many of us never thought we would witness in our lifetimes the fall of the Berlin Wall. That event changed the face of Europe and heralded a process of emancipation for our neighbours in central and eastern Europe which is nearing its conclusion. It is worth reminding ourselves of the 13 long years this process has taken as the siren voices of the sceptics seek to dash enlargement on the rocks.</p>
<p class="contents">In a previous debate, I described enlargement as a process of continuous assessment, not a one-off exam. I thank Mr Prodi for presenting today the Commission's assessment of the readiness of the applicant states to join the European Union which marks those countries' completion of a major assignment in that process. They are now approaching the final examination at the Copenhagen Summit. The prospects look good although they still have some hard work to do in the months ahead if they are to make the grade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Democrat Group has always sought to apply the Copenhagen criteria and the timetable, not to elevate one above the other. We, therefore, welcome the Commission's conclusion that the ten applicant states will be ready to join the European Union by 2004, but that monitoring of their preparations will continue. A reinforced monitoring system is necessary because the overview provided by the Commission clearly shows that there are deficiencies in the readiness of those applicant countries and we should be open about this. If we are to convince our own people of the case for enlargement, it must be clear that we are not sweeping problems under the carpet. Openness about those problems and the measures taken to tackle them will make us better able to reassure the doubters.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commission to transmit to Parliament all the regular enlargement reports which it will make to Council. If we await the comprehensive monitoring report six months before enlargement, the Commission may have no alternative but to impose safeguards since the nuclear option of suspending enlargement may not be viable. I hope that the threat of those safeguards will be sufficient to ensure that they are not used.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither should we forget, however, that it is not only our own voters who have to be convinced. There are referenda to be won in the applicant states. Critics in those countries who compare the European Union to the old Soviet Union are confusing a jacket with a straightjacket. Yet we must show those countries that they will benefit from enlargement from year one. This means a generous financial settlement which precludes them becoming net contributors in the short term. By introducing a secession clause in a new constitutional treaty, we would also assuage any fears that to join the European Union is to throw away the keys to freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is deeply worried that corruption remains widespread and that much work must be done to implement the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in justice and home affairs. We must be firm on the failings of the candidate countries, yet we must recognise that the report before us today is only a progress report. My own country struggled to meet the criteria 15 months before accession. Thirty years later, some might say that it is still struggling. One thing is clear, however. The monitoring of compliance with EU laws and respect for the Union's values is not a process which should end upon accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group welcomes the date of 2007 along with a roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania. The steps which they need to take must be clearly outlined by the Commission in time for Copenhagen, so that they are clear on what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent reforms undertaken by the Turkish Government represent a real breakthrough and, while no date can be set for Turkey's accession until the political criteria are met, we will watch with interest the implementation of these reforms. Turkey must be offered a pre-accession strategy accompanied by more financial support and a friendlier political environment. We must show the world that we are not an elite Christian club.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Cyprus will also have to be resolved to smooth the way for Turkey's entry. Here we look to Greece and Turkey to help broker an agreement before the Copenhagen Summit. The prospect of the whole of Cyprus joining the EU would start the Greek Presidency on a positive note which we hope would conclude, in Thessaloniki, with a summit symbolising reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the enlargement marathon is nearing the finish line. Despite the exertions thus far, the participants must be prepared for a sprint finish. Once they cross the line in Copenhagen, they will have little time to celebrate, the training for the next marathon begins – the marathon of meeting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and achieving democratic endorsement of the enlargement process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are preparing to take an historic decision. The headlines of a Brussels newspaper yesterday said that in just over a year we will have to talk about the Twenty-five instead of the Fifteen. This is in itself good news. I think I speak for my group as a whole in welcoming all these European nations. We shall have to rise to the common challenge of successful enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to succeed, however, we must address each and every problem if we want to avoid providing grist to the mill for people-pleasers or the shameful opponents of enlargement. And there is the rub. President of the Commission, I feel your presentation failed to address some serious problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take as an example the Community acquis, the most taboo subject of all. To you, and to many of my fellow Members here present, it is all or nothing. Any candidate country that questions any part of it would be excluded from negotiations. We all know, however, that some implications of the acquis will lead to acute, serious, dangerous social crises in these countries. We will not solve these problems by burying our heads in the sand. Quite the opposite. Transposal under pressure will solve nothing in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some States among the Fifteen that have obtained compromises on matters concerning their specific identity, and even among the founding countries of the Community, there are signed texts that are now being called into question again, such as the Stability and Growth Pact. The citizens of the Union, meanwhile, as you know, are contesting the acquis even more. The liberal structure of Europe, and the non-transparent way it is being created from the top down without the involvement of the people, is increasingly unacceptable. Such debates are also taking place within the candidate countries, at the highest levels. This is borne out, for example, by the essential conflict between the Polish Government and parliament and the Polish Central Bank, which is considered too liberal and too independent. For her part, the President of Latvia goes so far as to express her feeling, and I quote, 'of colonisation' within the population with regard to the Commission’s position on the agricultural chapter. You are aware of all that, yet you say nothing. I think that this is a mistake. You cannot bring down a fever by breaking the thermometer.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another aspect that I would like to highlight. Our counterparts in the candidate countries have told me about some unfortunate incidents. Apparently, a Commission negotiator, when faced with a few reservations, settled the debate in substance with these words: 'either you sign, or you wait'. What is achieved by the arrogance of the strong towards the weak? You achieve a signature now and ill feeling later. That is not the solution. We need to talk about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall simply note a third problem, since everyone is familiar with it, but I do think we need to talk about it because overall success depends on it to a great extent. This is the problem of funding for enlargement. If my memory serves me correctly, the Commission, in 1999, set aside EUR 40 billion for the period 2004-2006, when six countries were involved. The same sum is now set aside for ten countries. How can that work? And why are we not publicly reminding Member States which refuse the necessary financial solidarity that, over ten years, they, together with these countries, have benefited from an outrageous trade surplus of EUR 100 billion and that their companies are making substantial profits, the details of which we would like to know.</p>
<p class="contents">Forgive me for being so frank, but our only chance of achieving successful enlargement in future is to address real problems now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having lived through a few historic changes, I am a little disappointed by the cold wind blowing in this Chamber. Exactly thirteen years ago today, the first demonstration which led to the fall of the Berlin wall took place in Leipzig. You, Mr Poettering, with your usual skill, recalled Solidarity, with which we are all familiar. I admit that as far as the Pope is concerned, you can have him. I shall, nevertheless, mention two other groups of Polish heroes that you forgot: the Polish resistance that fought against Nazi barbarism and the Jewish resistance that also fought in the Warsaw ghetto against Nazi barbarism. If we are talking about Poland and the fight against totalitarianism, we should mention all the Poles who fought against all types of totalitarianism.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us come now to enlargement. I admit to being somewhat surprised, occasionally, by the condescending tone we use when speaking of the candidate countries. Clearly, they need to reform. Clearly, the change from a totalitarian culture to one of democracy and a market economy is difficult. But what I would have expected, wished, imagined, dreamt of, from the Commission at an historic moment, is for it to say that as enlargement is an exciting historical project, we, as Europeans, should try to project ourselves into history. What will the Europe we want be like in fifteen or twenty years with the Twenty-five? And what are these petty debates taking place among the Fifteen today with regard to enlargement, when we hear what took place at the last general affairs meeting, with regard to giving two more seats to the Czech Republic, for example, or two more seats to another State? When you think that we have still not managed to draw up a financial draft for agriculture, that we cannot draw up a financial draft for the Structural Funds … and why? Because the Fifteen today are afraid of history and are in fact creating a policy of selfishness. Let us call a spade a spade. Most of the governments steep themselves in history on Sundays, and on Monday they are afraid of what they dreamt the day before. That is why we are unable to progress.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen, as you said, you are asking for greater flexibility from the candidate countries with regard to financial problems. I would like to say that I personally am asking for greater solidarity and passion for history from the Fifteen. It is only through solidarity and passion with regard to enlargement that we will find the solutions to the more difficult issues. In a word, I would have liked to have received an explanation today, not of the old debate – should we first reform and consolidate before enlargement – but of the sine qua non conditions for successful enlargement, reforms and the consolidation of Europe prior to enlargement. This does not mean building a new barrier, but quite simply, Mr Poettering, making enlargement possible. If Europe continues to operate as it does at the moment, with the right of veto of one country or another in certain situations, we are heading for disaster and we are going to miss our date with history. That is the lesson to be learned. That is what I would have liked to hear so that we would be forced to act more quickly and carry out the process of the Convention in greater depth, with regard to agricultural reforms, Structural Fund reforms, reforms of the legal establishment in Europe, in order to make this establishment more democratic. Lastly, this should have been clearly stated. I myself am saying it on behalf of our group: what we dream of is, in ten or fifteen, or I do not know how many years, achieving social and ecological harmonisation across Europe, from Portugal to Hungary, from Poland to Italy. Total social harmonisation. I know that will take time, but is that our aim? Is that our dream? Or is it something we do not want, because we want to retain the differentiation between nations? That is what I think is somewhat lacking in the speeches made by the Presidency and the Commission. But that does not matter, history can sometimes force us to be more enthusiastic. And you will see, you too, with your enthusiasm, will one day go down in the annals of history.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to say briefly to Mr Cohn-Bendit that passion is a wonderful thing but if passion is not based on pragmatism and common sense, it is wasted. If Mr Cohn-Bendit has passion in abundance at the moment, perhaps he would direct some of it to his Green colleagues from my country who are trying to convince the electorate that they should vote against the Treaty of Nice. If we want to be passionate, then let our passion be based on facts. The fact is that if the ten applicant countries proposed by the Commission – for whose efforts I am grateful and I thank Commissioners Prodi and Verheugen in particular – are to be part of the enlarged Europe which Mr Cohn-Bendit is dreaming of, then please tell the people of my country, on behalf of the Green Party of Europe, that they should vote 'yes' to the Treaty of Nice. We would welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is little point in being all things to all people at all times. Let us base our advice to the electorate on facts. It is wrong of Green Party Members to say to the people of my country that the Amsterdam Treaty provides for the enlargement process which we are talking about. It does not provide for the accession of ten new Member States. If we must have ten new Member States, as we want to, and then perhaps Romania and Bulgaria as soon as possible and then Turkey in due course, then let us put the truth to the people that the Treaty of Nice must be accepted if that is to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commission on the tremendous work that it has done in dealing with all the applicant countries and the fact that it is now in a position to recommend ten countries for accession. I want to compliment Commissioner Verheugen for what he said in relation to Turkey. It is important that this Parliament recognises that over the last year and a half, tremendous progress has been made in Turkey and this should not be forgotten. Turkey's position today should not be seen as a rejection by the European Union in any shape or form.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cyprus is concerned, I am glad that Cyprus has made considerable progress and that it has been recommended to us. I would also like to endorse what has been proposed to us by the Commission in relation to the political problem in Turkey and Cyprus, with the northern part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey. We should use all our influence to ensure that a role for the United Nations is accepted in this respect because there is no other way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to this Parliament, to my colleagues and friends, that despite the best efforts of those in this House who have been trying to confuse the issue of the Treaty of Nice in relation to my country, the Irish people totally support enlargement. We will have a majority by the end of next week for the Treaty of Nice.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bonde (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Ireland is one of the two countries in which a majority of people would regret the EU’s being dissolved. The Treaty of Nice has been tested in the country which is most favourably disposed to the EU, yet 54% of the population voted against it. It would, then, have been more natural to have asked the inhabitants of other countries whether they cared for the treaty but, instead, the Irish were asked to vote on it again, as in fact they <span class="italic">are</span> doing, faced with the threat that, if they do not, enlargement will come to a halt. In all honesty, is there a single minister who would put the brakes on enlargement if the Irish were to vote ‘no’. Of course not. Enlargement will continue. The situation is anticipated in the Treaty of Amsterdam in the form of a protocol which, by giving them a double majority or more votes in the Council, will compensate the five largest countries for the loss of their second Commissioner. This outcome was negotiated on the spot in Nice. It is not something to boast about, but it exists in a special declaration which is not part of the treaty and has not therefore been rejected, either. It can be called into play, irrespective of whether the Irish vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also call upon the Brussels Summit to correct the figures. It is a scandal that Hungary and Turkey are being offered fewer places in the European Parliament than countries with smaller populations. The new weighting system is impossible to remember, even for ministers. Instead, a straightforward system should be devised which can be explained to the people of those countries that are shortly to vote on membership.</p>
<p class="contents">There should also be more flexibility in relation to the candidate countries. The EU should not receive them like a steamroller that crushes everything they themselves have devised in the way of laws. We should be content to lay down requirements concerning their conduct in the common market and allow them to retain their freedom in all the areas in which there is no documented common need for cross-border laws. They should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to keep their national currencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural land in the Czech Republic costs 10% of that in Germany. Why not allow the candidate countries to keep their laws concerning the purchase and sale of land. What would the Czechs say if Sudetenland were to be bought up with German euros. I come from that part of Denmark that was occupied by Germany. Today, we have an excellent relationship with our neighbours, which I commend and consider to be a model for Northern Ireland and other areas with national tensions. The Danish summer house protocol contributes to the good relationship between Danes and Germans. Without this, the best situated houses would be bought up, because the price of a German summer house is several times that of a Danish one.</p>
<p class="contents">The transitional arrangements agreed with the candidate countries encourage unnecessary division and will give rise to many ‘no’ votes in the referendums.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has different attitudes to enlargement. The Danish June Movement is heavily critical of the conditions we are offering the candidate countries, but those of us in this Chamber will vote in favour of them because we respect the candidate countries’ own decisions. We hope that the many new democracies can breathe some democratic life into us so that we might obtain a slimmer, freer, open and decentralised Europe for all.</p>
<p class="contents">With greater flexibility, Bulgaria and Romania could also join. It is a little sad to see them excluded, because they have been left to languish in poverty for a far longer period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also applies to the peoples of Eastern Europe who, for decades, lived under the Communist yoke and who for decades were unable to count on the solidarity of anyone in this hemisphere, of not a single one of the political families in this hemisphere who are now, however, all holding forth. I am therefore not opposed to the principle of European enlargement, provided that it is, of course, a European enlargement and not a small Asian enlargement to include a country such as Turkey, which does not belong to Europe, whether that is understood geographically, historically, politically or culturally. I am, however, opposed to a hurried and dogmatic enlargement such as is being prepared for today and which, I fear, is set to lead to major social, economic, cultural and social problems. Problems will arise in the current Member States, which will undoubtedly be faced with a major, fresh wave of immigration, but also in the candidate countries when their highly trained people, engineers, doctors, nurses, construction workers and many more will almost certainly, for financial reasons, leave their countries to find a better paid job elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If the free movement of persons, goods and capital will, in reality, generate more poverty, more immigration, more crime and more uprooting both in former Eastern Europe and here, then the responsible politicians should really first consider a method of guaranteeing a more harmonious unification process. Let us therefore take some time-out, let us go ahead with this enlargement, but let us admit: today, at this moment, the free movement of persons is not yet possible. If not, we are in danger of placing a time bomb under Europe which may go off more quickly than we realise, or to use La Fontaine's words: let us ensure that Europe does not await the tragic fate of the frog who at one time dreamt of being able, very quickly, to turn into an ox. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has put forward a proposal, based on all the analyses that have been possible to date, which is viable – so viable, indeed, that it will be possible, in December, to take the decisions to invite ten countries to join the European Union. As the chairman of the committee responsible, let me say that we are making preparations to shape the parliamentary procedure as speedily as possible so that there is no delay on Parliament's part, and so that the date envisaged for the signing of the Treaties can be adhered to. I am convinced that overall, Parliament will endorse a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a great moment, but this great moment does not mark the completion of the work, for the difficult negotiations will continue until December. It must be clear that we cannot hold the accession countries hostage to problems we face in one Member State or another. It must be clear to us that reforms must be undertaken in areas such as agricultural policy, but these reforms must not be framed in such a way as to give rise to an alibi for delaying the enlargement process. The internal process within the European Union must be shaped in a way that ensures that there are no trumped-up new grounds for delay. This is why we also call on the governments of the Member States to ensure that in those specific areas – such as agricultural policy and financing – where they have still not reached agreement, to do so as quickly as possible so that it is not down to us if there is a delay in the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this process, for example, we must try to resolve the Cyprus issue in a way that ensures that there are no new tensions or delays. I realise this is like squaring the circle, but I believe that this issue, too, can be resolved. It must be clear that, outside the European Union, there is nothing by virtue of which any of the accession candidates has any right to influence the timetable for enlargement as it affects any country whatever. There are many cases in which we too must have a clear awareness of this, regardless of the direction in which this is meant.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the accession candidates also need to continue their efforts, and I would like to thank the Commission for placing such emphasis on implementation through appropriate administrative and judicial structures. The accession candidates still have a great deal of work to do before accession comes in 2004. Transposing Community law into national law is not enough. Capacity to implement this law in practice is also required. This means providing the necessary aid, but it also means making the necessary efforts. These efforts cannot end in December, for otherwise, we will find ourselves in a very difficult situation. This also means making it clear – also with regard to the Czech Republic – that we have a legal system which does not tolerate discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, no EU citizen may suffer discrimination on any grounds whatsoever. The European Union is not there to settle old scores but to make a new start and break through the cycle of violence in Europe, and this means that everyone must be willing to make their contribution. I hope that the relevant reports commissioned by Parliament will be duly noted by all sides and the opportunity taken to unite this with appropriate signals, gestures and actions so that it can work well in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just add one more sentence, which should really be the longest part of my speech. We too still have our homework to do, for we are not yet ready for enlargement either. For this reason, the Convention preparing the European constitution must be a success next year: this is a prerequisite if an enlarged Community is to function. We too are therefore called on to make a particular effort in this context.</p>

I would like to thank the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Verheugen, for this proposal which responds fully to the expectations of the European Parliament and which should surprise nobody. Throughout the negotiation process, we have seen complete agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament over the fundamental elements of the Cypriot dossier. It also appears now that accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus have been a powerful catalyst in the United Nations’ efforts to solve the political problem of the island in accordance with the rules of international law. Although nothing has been achieved as yet, and despite the threats of annexing and crisis from Ankara, the recent communication from the Secretary-General of the United Nations is still based on the idea that a political framework solution can be found by the end of the year. Parliament, in its latest resolutions, clearly listed the conditions with which such an arrangement would have to comply for Cyprus to be able to fully meet its obligations as a Member of the EU. The Cypriot federal state must possess a central government as well as a parliament to control it, which is able to take all decisions within the framework of the Treaty, as well as participating in these policies. It would also have to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the island’s territory. The awakening of civil society and the surveys carried out in northern Cyprus confirm that the majority of the Turkish Cypriot population is also in favour of a pro-European policy. I therefore hope that vigorous political will will make it possible to overcome the remaining obstacles and that the forces of the Union will triumph over the forces of division. In the absence of this policy, or if it were hindered by external interference, the Copenhagen European Council would have to take its decisions in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the accession of ten new countries, the European area of peace and stability is growing, and so is the scope for human rights and democracy. This is a reason to rejoice. Candidate countries were given powerful incentives to bring about the necessary changes. We, however, have not shown the same level of commitment to forcefully implementing the changes that are necessary to fashion this real Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Former enlargements have shown that prosperity has increased, both in the countries concerned and for EU citizens. Mr Prodi has stated that the costs will be reimbursed, but our citizens are not all convinced of this. Quite the reverse. It will require courage and powers of persuasion to remove the feelings of uncertainty and fear, particularly at a time of economic decline.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there are still flaws in the system. Mr Prodi himself mentioned fraud, corruption and the trafficking in human beings. The problems surrounding Cyprus and Poland's internal problems were also mentioned, and the discussion on Turkey is overshadowing everything else. We should not arouse false expectations. Hence the need for us to inform our citizens of what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">We as regionalists and peoples without a state are very sensitive to the problems that still exist with regard to discrimination against peoples and cultural minorities. We are sensitive to the non-recognition of regional and historical realities in the different accession countries. All of this raises the question of whether we still have the time and resources to put these things right before accession becomes a reality. However, we are giving accession the green light today because a red light would be a sign of hostility, while we are, quite rightly in fact, dreaming of this area of peace and stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet nobody, neither the candidate countries, nor, in particular, the Fifteen, is prepared to accept the consequences, especially the financial consequences, of enlargement. Mr Prodi’s Commission did not rise to the occasion and it is clear that the desire to succeed, to consecrate his mandate at the head of the European Commission took precedence over any other considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to extend our family circle, but we have not extended the house. On the contrary, since Nice, each party has retreated within its own private garden. We therefore need to have the courage to say that the decision on enlargement must be postponed. The principle is there. But the decision must be postponed at least until the European Convention, for example, proposes a new common architecture for the twenty-five States and new operating rules. The decision must not be taken in Copenhagen this December, but in Athens or Rome next year, which would not entail any delay in the accession of Member States should the decision be positive.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I shall vote against the report presented to us by the Commission. I congratulate the Commission simply on having closed the door to Turkey, a decision which is essentially just as incomprehensible as the decision to open this same door. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the quality of the preparations is so crucial. The Commission has today given the green light for the accession of ten countries, but it acknowledges at the same time that not all the criteria have been fulfilled as yet. In light of this aspect, the Paris newspaper <span class="italic">Le Figaro</span> reports its 'creeping and unpleasant sensation of jumping into a void without a parachute'. I would not go quite that far, but numerous sensitive issues remain unresolved: financing, Cyprus, and the Beneš decrees are just some of the key words here. I am extremely disappointed by the Czech Government's stance of declining even to talk about the issues. Europe means talking to each other! I am disappointed by the Commission's stance. What kind of community of values will the EU become in future if it meekly accepts a law which assures impunity for murder?</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken of rifts. They are offset not only by the advantages but also the opportunity to enlarge the zone of security and stability and overcome the division of Europe.

The candidates which, all things being equal, will be taking part in the European elections as fully-fledged members in 2004, will soon be able to send observers to this Parliament, something to which we are very much looking forward. The result presented to us by the Commission deserves warm congratulations, as especially does the person primarily responsible for this, Commissioner Verheugen.</p>
<p class="contents">We said in Parliament at the time that the loose ends should be few and short. This is exactly what we are seeing in the transitional stage: loose ends that are few and short, except – understandably – for those that have to do with the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Casting our minds back to 1989, we can recall the general enthusiasm that greeted the return to Europe of peoples who had long been oppressed. This enthusiasm is still among us in copious amounts. It is therefore all the more painful to see how at some ministries, this return has been reduced to nothing but a money matter. Some hold the false, yet persistent, belief that the European Union, and particularly the addition of new Member States, would be costly and would require huge sacrifices on our part. Some xenophobic instincts also persist, and are the subject of shameless speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">Communicating the truth, namely that the European Union only costs 1.27% of GNP and that, on account of internal savings, another 0.14% has been freed up for enlargement, that it has been settled in Berlin and fixed until 2006, in other words that the whole budgetary procedure is running smoothly, is a virtually impossible task. If some of this does manage to trickle through, there will always be some Finance Ministry or other which, by sketching worst-case scenarios, combined with strong exaggerations and their own interpretation of the figures, is prepared once again to awaken latent fears, put enlargement in a bad light and even to use the candidate countries as bargaining counters in the political wrangle with other Member States about the review of agricultural policy. This is transgressing the rules of decency.</p>
<p class="contents">The care that the Commission has exercised on behalf of the Council is manifested in various ways, one being the statement that the permanent, sustainable implementation of the negotiation results must be monitored for the time being. In the coming years, there will certainly be reason to assist some new Member States, or show them the right way, particularly on an administrative level. What they have already achieved is indeed to be applauded.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a clause was already used during the preparatory stages of the Treaty of Amsterdam. We then introduced the well-known article which even provides for sanctions if a Member strays from its path in terms of rule of law and democracy. This article applies to us all. As has often been established scientifically, including by our former fellow MEP Mr Burenstam Lindner, enlargements always bring economic benefits to all parties involved, to the existing Members more so than the new ones. More important, however, is the gain in terms of a fairer, more peaceful legal order in Europe and the establishment of a European community of values. The contribution to this by new members may be significant in this respect too. I hope that the same spirit which prevailed at the start of Europe's integration will also inspire the new and old Member States in future too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with Commissioner Verheugen: much has been achieved, but many more reforms are required and we as parliamentarians in particular must study and evaluate the reports with vision, but also with precision and pragmatism, just as we must scrutinise the outcomes of the negotiations. I would like to make one thing clear from the outset: without further efforts to establish the internal market, to integrate minorities – such as the Roma and Sinti – and enforce the rule of law, enlargement is unlikely to succeed. However, let me also say, on this point, that it is down to us to behave in a way which is likely to build bridges.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the phrase 'Beneš Decrees' has already been mentioned, let me say that I am very gratified by the studies commissioned by this Parliament, which show that there are no legal obstacles to the Czech Republic's accession. At the same time, I believe it would be conducive to the climate of the negotiations and the decision-making process if the Czech Republic could find the courage to clarify the situation, which would entail a reappraisal of the Beneš Decrees from a modern perspective – not as a demand or a condition, but rather as an offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one comment in my capacity as a former rapporteur for Turkey. I understand that many people in Turkey, especially the pro-European forces, are disappointed by the Commission's proposals since they do not set a specific date for accession negotiations. However, I understand and endorse the Commission's position, and I see a great opportunity for Turkey if it does not simply fixate on a possible date but is prepared to work with the European Union on building a genuine economic and political partnership with the EU until accession is possible. The Commission's proposals are a starting point. However, more can be done, and we can work on this together in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked today: what do I say to my constituents? What does the Commission's proposal mean? I would say that it means a resounding 'yes' to accession, and 'yes' to accession in 2004. However, it also means that it is up to the countries themselves to decide whether they want to fold their hands in their laps or whether they are willing to continue working on the reforms. My hope is that all the candidates are willing to continue working on the necessary reforms.</p>

I should also like to say a big thank-you to this Parliament and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy which quickly reached a decision, with very broad agreement, to support this enlargement project. Parliament showed the way and Parliament can now see the result. Credit where credit is due. I have heard many debates in this house, but never have I seen such huge consensus on a project as many-faceted as that to which we are here giving further impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">There was of course one dissenting voice and, since I am the only Dane speaking today, I should like to provide a little consumer information to Irish voters. In Denmark, no one is surprised at the fact that Mr Bonde is now conducting a campaign against the new treaty. He has conducted campaigns against all the treaties. He adopted an oppositional stance during the Cold War when he was against everything that strengthened the Western democracies against the Communist dictatorships. He was opposed to Danish membership of the EC. He was in the opposition camp when we voted for the first time on the Maastricht Treaty, as he also was when we voted on it for the second time. He conducted a campaign against the Treaty of Amsterdam, and now he is conducting one against the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">That is fair enough as far as it goes, but it is not fair enough if the Irish electorate is unaware that, in supporting Mr Bonde, they are supporting someone who is against the whole set-up and who has been opposed to every single aspect of European cooperation. I just thought there was no harm in saying that. My apologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This satisfaction is, however, tinged with regret. The accessions will go hand in hand with an inextricable muddle of several hundred derogations and transitional measures, and barely veiled threats from the Commission to the candidates: the possibility of sending a preventive warning letter to States that do not comply quickly enough, and even a summons to appear before the Court of Luxembourg. Welcome to a disciplinary Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">If this is what we have come to, we would have been better off, as we suggested, with the accession of these States as early as 1990 to a European political confederation, with variable geometry of common policies, and gradual accession for some States as appropriate. We would not then have been faced with the impossible equation of balancing a monolithic organisation with diversity; we would not now be forced to leave Bulgaria and Romania shamefully by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, however, this model will once again prove appropriate.
