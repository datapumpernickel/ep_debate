We are satisfied that Albania has made progress in its reforms so that the talks on the agreement, which had been going on for so long, could be brought to a conclusion. Together with the other mechanisms covered by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the pact will create a comprehensive framework for the further development of relations between the EU and Albania. The Interim Agreement, which was signed at the same time, is intended to enter into force from the start of November. It covers trade under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and related matters which will apply up until the Member States have ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement proper. It is important that we start to make effective use of the Interim Agreement once it has entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is of major importance for Albania’s future. It will enhance economic and political relations between the EU and Albania and make it easier for Albania to have closer ties with the European Union. Albania is the third country in the Western Balkans (after Macedonia and Croatia in the former Republic of Yugoslavia) with which the EU has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement does not mean that the work has ended. On the contrary, the real work is only really just beginning now.</p>
<p class="contents">We now expect Albania to demonstrate continued and effective progress in the implementation of the agreements. It must work hard to take forward the reforms necessary for closer ties with the EU. It is important that progress should be made in particular in such areas as freedom of the media, the return of property and compensation being paid, more efficient public administration and a respect for the principles of the rule of law. We will continually stress the importance for Albania, as for the other countries in the Western Balkans, of stepping up measures to prevent corruption and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">There may be local elections in Albania in six months’ time, and Albania should ensure that it can see them through in accordance with international norms.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reforms necessary for closer ties with the EU to be taken forward, all the political powers will need to pull together. The current political climate in Albania is worrying and is a serious threat to the progress of reform. We are urging the parties concerned to take part in constructive dialogue and we are pleased that some initial first results were achieved just last week.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to remind everyone that at the European Council in June the European Union once again endorsed the EU perspective in respect of the countries in the Western Balkans. That means that Albania too has a future place in the Europe Union. We must nevertheless remember that each country’s progress towards EU accession stands or falls on its own merits in its attempts to meet EU requirements. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement provide Albania with the best possible framework for its own attempts. The Union must of course continue to help, but most of the work still to do can only be done by Albania itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The SAA is an important milestone on Albania’s path towards the European Union and a major step for the EU itself in the Western Balkans. It marks the beginning of a new phase in the EU’s relations with Albania and creates a new framework for partnership in a wide range of fields.</p>
<p class="contents">The SAA represents an important economic and political opportunity. Increased trade liberalisation will bring significant economic benefits to both Albania and the EU. Aligning Albanian laws with those of the EU will bring Albania closer to European standards and help further strengthen the ties between us.</p>
<p class="contents">Successfully implementing the SAA will be Albania’s next major challenge. The SAA creates significant obligations in terms of trade, rule of law, democratic standards and fundamental rights, regional cooperation and new legislation. The SAA sets up joint structures to foster dialogue and monitor progress, including a parliamentary committee. This committee will be able to take forward the good work of the current Joint Parliamentary Committee and will provide an important opportunity to guide Albania in the best traditions of European parliamentary democracy. I am sure it will also help to achieve a minimal degree of consensual political culture and underline the fact that a successful country in the European Union, or in the accession or pre-accession process, needs a broad political consensus on the question of European aspirations, as well as a basic consensus on a democratic culture in the country. It is important to take this into account as Albania pursues its European route.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission warmly welcomes the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for assent to the conclusion of the SAA. In our political dialogue we share the committee’s emphasis on encouraging Albania to build on progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and to address areas such as electoral reform, media freedom and human and minority rights with greater determination. We welcome the recommendations of the Committee on International Trade on improving Albania’s business environment, which is vital to enable Albania to make full use of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by assuring you that, from the EU side, the European Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the full benefit of the SAA is truly achieved. I have made it clear to our Albanian partners that I expect no less from them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a country that groaned under Stalinism well into the 1980s, thus it must be clear to all of us that it faced far greater challenges than other post-communist countries like my own, for whom the worst excesses of Stalinist totalitarianism ended in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="contents">Albania has made enormous progress: the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is proof of it. At the same time, Albania should not rest on its laurels. To meet its European calling it needs to do more. The SAA is a milepost, it is not a destination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would sum up my report as follows. The SAA and the interim agreement offer a golden opportunity for Albania to modernise itself and become a competitive market economy, the sine qua non for joining the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, genuine economic development requires a stable and transparent legal environment. This means a professional and independent judiciary, an effective and politically unbiased fight against corruption and an efficient, well-functioning public administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as with all transition countries, a sound legal framework is not enough. Good laws on the books help little if they are not enforced. Progress must be made in implementing the adopted reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, progress in achieving the standards laid down in the SAA, and therefore implementing the reforms, should be monitored by the EU by means of concrete benchmarks.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these general themes, I would like to underline a number of specific points in the report. While giving full support to Albania’s European perspective in line with the Thessaloniki conclusions, the report underlines that Albania needs to pursue the fulfilment of European values and standards as a goal in itself. It calls for a visa facilitation agreement with Albania. Today, citizens of a small country with a European perspective have a less favourable visa regime with the EU than a large country with no membership prospects – Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls on the EU and Albania to take advantage of the knowledge and experience of the 2004 accession states. The challenges faced by Albania are not unique; there is no need to reinvent the wheel when the expertise of the wheelwrights of reform from eight post-communist EU Member States is freely available.</p>
<p class="contents">The report notes that a recent Amnesty International report was critical of Albania for violations of human rights in areas of access to legal defence, the problems of torture and brutality towards prisoners, and so on. These deficiencies must be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">The report says that electoral legislation must be reformed. This means a more reliable voters’ registry and changes in the system to avoid distortion of the proportionality system – this system is currently known as the ‘Dushk’ system in Albania – because, let us be honest, faith and democracy will not last if the voters’ will is distorted. I think this is one of the crucial democracy issues that the country faces today.</p>
<p class="contents">The report underlines the need for Albania to continue with its responsible attitude towards neighbouring countries, particularly towards Kosovo and FYROM. As we know, there are substantial Albanian minorities in FYROM, and Kosovo, of course, is an Albanian area. We welcome the attitude taken thus far by Albania in not getting involved in those problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received six amendments. I will take on board Amendment 5 from Mr Brie and Mr Meijer on the need to address the issue of trafficking of children. Amendments 1 and 2 are good in principle, but in the opinion of the rapporteur will be more appropriate when Albania has made far more progress in dealing with its fundamental problems involving corruption, the rule of law and economic reforms. In my opinion, Amendment 3 on the treatment of prisoners is already covered in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this report, but I would especially like to single out Mrs Pack, the dynamo driving so much of this House’s approach to bringing the Balkans into Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a fact that the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement opens a new path for Albania towards Europe, towards the European institutions, with the ultimate objective of integration into the European family. We must always remember this; it is what the European strategy decided in Thessaloniki says and I believe that the European Union has every strategic interest, despite enlargement fatigue, to strengthen these European prospects of the countries of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly a great deal still needs to be done in Albania, as Mr Ilves has pointed out. I should like to touch in particular on two or three points. On the question of combating corruption, we are of course all agreed. However, under no circumstances should the present Albanian Government use combating corruption as a pretext to settle political accounts with the opposition forces. This is a serious issue which we have experienced in Albania in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the need to proceed immediately to reform the electoral system and update electoral rolls. This is very important, because it will help to smooth out political life and consolidate a democratic political system.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is respect for the freedom of the media and, of course, the prevention of government interference in its operation. I should like to point out here – and my comments are addressed to Mr Rehn – that there has been increased government interference over recent days in the operation of media of the Albanian democratic opposition, to be specific the socialist party. I refer, Mr Rehn, to the Top Channel television network, which is being hampered in its operation by the Albanian authorities. This too is an issue which we need to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, respect for minorities. Albania really does need to take important steps here. There is a Greek minority which is playing an important role and is an asset to the democratisation of Albania and, of course, the functioning of the Orthodox Church and the spiritual role of Archbishop Anastasios must be facilitated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doris Pack, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Ilves, your report, Mr Ilves, shows a very great deal of empathy with, and understanding of, the young democracy of Albania, but also the rigorous approach that is required when considering it; it is a very good report, and I am grateful to you for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you will be aware that I have, for fourteen years, been observing Albania as it has emerged from a long period of dictatorship and moved closer to the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that I am particularly pleased that we are able, today, to vote to approve this stabilisation and association agreement, something I welcome as an important step towards a relationship of trust between Albania and the EU, which will help Albania and its politicians to give the country the political, economic and institutional stability that it needs. It will be very difficult to make progress down this road; to do so, it will be necessary to achieve the standards required, as laid down in the agreement, and for this Parliament, and our committee on relations with it in particular, to monitor this progress continuously and with the utmost precision. We too, as good friends, will do as we have done for many years and highlight any deficiencies, including those yet to be discovered.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I think it much to be welcomed that war has been declared on corruption in Albania, I do also think that all the political forces must treat this campaign with the same seriousness, for it will not meet with real and lasting success unless they do. Over recent months, a number of criminal gangs have been unmasked and arrested; this is a very good result and an incentive to further action of the same kind aimed at taking passport-forgers, drug-dealers and the like out of circulation and bringing them to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The government is doing a splendid job in the educational field and thereby giving the many young Albanians a bit more of a future; I very much hope that it will do everything necessary to enable them to participate in the European Union’s new educational programmes after 2007. It is also a good thing that the government is making the effort to attract the investment that the country needs, although that will of course be conditional on the reforms in administration and the justice system that are so urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution also highlights the need for the practice of the bloodfeud, still prevalent in many parts of Albania, to be stamped out; our call for this is founded on our European values, which, we hope, will soon guide the thoughts and actions of all Albanians.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no wish to conceal the fact that I found much of what happened over the summer months highly disagreeable, but, without going into unpleasant details, I would like to stress that what is urgently needed is political dialogue, and that political maturity is demonstrated by democratic behaviour and nothing else.</p>
<p class="contents">The political forces on all sides should also, and once and for all, stop constantly crying out for an international mediator to sort their problems out. Albanian politicians are elected to resolve problems in a democratic manner and to perform in a constructive manner the role allotted to them, whether it involves exercising governmental responsibility or serving in the opposition. Recent years have shown the futility of boycotts, and they would not be worth the effort now either; the Albanian people have had enough of that sort of stunt, and what they want is serious politicians with a serious interest in sorting problems out.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that it is so heartening that the political forces have come to an agreement on the tiresome subject of electoral rolls. The European Union has for years been paying a great deal of money to get these lists at last drawn up properly, and it is still proving extremely difficult. Local elections are due to be held shortly, and if the results are to be acceptable, they must be based on largely secure data.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing dispute between the government and a private television station can, I believe, be properly resolved only by full compliance with the law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, by way of conclusion, to remind the House that we have for a long time been arguing the case for easier visa arrangements for Albania and for the other countries of South-Eastern Europe, and so we very much welcome the return agreements reached by Albania and the EU. Albania is among the few countries that have done this, and one of the things we are calling for by means of our resolution is prompt action on the part of European governments to make it easier for students, academics and businessmen to get visas, with, of course, a more relaxed visa regime for all citizens following on as soon as possible. Criminals either acquire visas by dubious means or have no need of them, being, as they are, familiar with other ways of getting across borders, but the success of efforts in Albania to combat crime may perhaps make it possible for European governments to at last work miracles where the allocation of visas is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Albania is a difficult, complicated country, and I think that he is correct in his analysis of it and the conclusions he has drawn. We too welcome the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and will vote in favour of it here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement reflects how much has been achieved with sheer perseverance, and opens the way to EU candidate membership on the basis of the agreements that were made in Thessaloniki. Our group will continue to support Albania in the steps it will have to take as it moves towards European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the early 1990s, Albania was the most isolationist country of the European continent. By signing this agreement, it joins with various other Balkan countries that have made courageous strides over the past year. Croatia is now negotiating with the EU about membership; Macedonia has received candidate-member status and clear progress has also been made with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as a group, did briefly consider asking for deferral of vote on this agreement, as a means of bringing some pressure to bear on the authorities in Albania and getting them to ensure that the forthcoming local elections run smoothly, but we think you can also turn the argument around, by saying that signing this agreement, Parliament's approval of it, spurs all parties in Albania on to behave properly and to continue on the road towards political and economic reforms, in respect of which we can work with the criteria we used in other countries that worked on a future within the European Union, particularly, of course, the first Copenhagen criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, not lose sight of the fact that there is still a long way to go. This signing does not mean that the Albanian Government, which has presented the concluding of this agreement as an important victory, can rest on its laurels, and I hope that people in Albania are aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the Copenhagen criteria, the ultimate benchmark for EU membership, the Albanian Government should be alerted to a number of things. I have already mentioned the local elections, which, we assume, everyone will keep free and fair. We will ensure that they are, while also hoping that the Commission and the Council will keep an eye on things.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to comment on the situation in the media. Free and independent media are indispensable for a transparent and robust democracy. It is clearly up to a country’s government to make sure that those are in place, but we have to establish that the media are under pressure to some extent, partly due to the proposed change to the Act on electronic media.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also some question marks surrounding the judiciary’s independence. Those are all issues which the European Union will need to monitor closely, even after the ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have perceived a degree of political polarisation in that country that concerns us. That is not new, but we still cannot see any closure in that respect. We would therefore like to urge the government and opposition to adopt a mainly pragmatic and constructive approach, for only then can Albania fully utilise the scope which this agreement offers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe fully understand the difficulties it is experiencing. After its decade–long allegiance with China, it has woken up as the least developed country in Europe. This is why we understand its difficulties. In particular, there are still echoes today, of the severe economic crises that shocked Albanian society as a result of its pyramid economy. They continue to be reflected in the difficulties the country is experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, now that Albania has signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, there are new challenges both for Albania and for us. It now has a new neighbour, an independent Montenegro. It will have a new neighbour, an independent Kosovo. Another neighbour, Macedonia, has been granted the status of a candidate country and is only awaiting a date to begin negotiations. These are all changes for the better and the Albanian political elite should take advantage of these changes to boost economic development and, in particular, social development.</p>
<p class="contents">The rule of law cannot be based on centuries–old traditions that have no respect for the values of the European Union. Blood feuds have to be relegated to the dustbin of history, otherwise Albania will not be able to move towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Albanian political elite has to make greater efforts to combat corruption and pave the way for economic, political and legal development. Our greatest concern, however, is their failure to combat crime in a few highly sensitive areas. Violations of human rights, human trafficking and child abuse are areas that erode the fundamental values of the European Union and our civilisation. Conditions in prisons are unsatisfactory. Under such circumstances, Albania cannot move forward and should be sharply criticised on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">Without freedom of the press and freedom of speech, Albania cannot get a realistic picture of itself. So a prerequisite for Albania’s faster progress is freedom of the press, which should be a mirror for the problems of Albanian society. Only those who realise their mistakes can remedy them. So our Albanian friends should not take umbrage if we are candid in our discussions with them as we try to make absolutely clear to them things that they have to see themselves.</p>

Having lived through decades of a totalitarian regime, Albania really is making great leaps forward, and we see that as the best evidence that the process of integration into the EU really is, after all, a motor and a motivation for the realisation of human rights, the rule of law and for encouraging economic development too.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that this process is far from complete, and various Members, along with Commissioner Rehn, have already drawn attention to the really critical aspects that can all be summed up under the overarching heading of ‘enforcement of the rule of law’. I would also like to remind you that a European institution such as our own, if it is to do this, needs a process of partnership and support, which will in turn require funding and personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier on, in the debate on Kosovo, we pointed out that our budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 does not exactly inspire confidence. There is also – as my colleagues have repeatedly emphasised – a need for further support in areas such as the improvement of environmental conditions, sustainable energy and transport infrastructure and in the establishment of truly independent media.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have high hopes of Albania, having gained useful experience in the negotiations on a stability and association agreement, really playing a constructive role in the region, and if they pass this experience on to their counterparts in Kosovo, the region as a whole will become more stable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Albanians were farmers and shepherds who had been left behind and whom nobody wanted to take into consideration. When the Ottoman empire collapsed nearly a century ago, both Serbia and Italy tried to establish permanent ownership of Albanians’ territory. It is a miracle that, in 1913, in the most inhospitable part of Albanian territory, it proved possible to establish an independent state although it has not been a success to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Following right-wing dictatorship, foreign occupation and left-wing dictatorship, what is immediately apparent at the moment is chaos and the intolerance between the political parties. Especially the north of that country is unsafe and disadvantaged. Whilst the millions of Albanians who live around Albania along the south edge of Montenegro, in the largest part of Kosovo and in the north-west of Macedonia, fight for language rights and self-government, they expect little in the way of positive developments if they were to join forces with Albania in its current state.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, public opinion would prefer to keep Albania outside of the European Union. The country is now mainly renowned for child trafficking, the pyramid schemes, wasting energy, prisoner abuse and international crime. Its problems appear to be beyond any solution.</p>
<p class="contents">During preparatory discussions, it transpired that other groups are more optimistic than my own about the course of affairs in Albania, and that they feel less inclined to invite Albania to change. Despite this difference of opinion, my group shares their view that continued isolation and exclusion from European cooperation offer no solution to Albania’s enormous problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The promise of a prospect of EU membership must be kept. In the intervening period, which is set to last for some time, they need support for democracy, education, the environment and the economy. I find it lamentable that the proposed decision appears to be better geared for foreign companies than for the environment, food safety and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the neighbourhood policy and association agreements should not unilaterally serve the interests of the current EU Member States, but should primarily help possible future EU members gain ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to announce that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote for the resolution, and it is warmly welcomed by the Italian National Alliance delegation. It is well known that Italy is watching the progress of the young Republic of Albania closely, favourably and with interest, especially since the clear and reassuring victory of President Berisha. This agreement will promote increasingly strong and extensive contractual relations between Albania and the European Union; it will certainly promote political, economic and institutional stability in that country; and it will promote Albania’s transition both towards a full, pluralist democracy that respects the rule of law, and towards a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The main benefits of the agreement are the creation of a free trade zone, a serious commitment to cooperation in areas of mutual interest and, above all, the promotion of a more stable legal environment that will reassure foreign investors. It is well known that, during the previous period from 1997 to 2005, the government’s stranglehold on political and economic power stifled the market economy and constrained the fabric of society, in which tolerance and permissiveness went hand in hand with corrupting and sometimes Mafia-like methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more needs to be done, and Albania has done much more, for instance in stopping and pursuing smugglers and preventing the traffic in human beings between Albania and Italy. This fight against corruption and organised crime needs to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Albania must invest heavily in infrastructure, transport and tourism, but the Commission must do more as well: it must provide more resources, particularly for transport and corridor 8, since the importance of infrastructure networks should be considered a necessary condition for development and cohesion. Such networks potentially allow access to all parts of the country, and so each area will be able to make the best use of its resources, process them and sell its products on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has not been one spokesman from any of the wings who has not referred to Albania as a country in which crime is flourishing, in which there are numerous smugglers, in which children are trafficked. At the same time, we hear all the spokesmen saying, yes, Albania must join the European family. I find this a little strange. However, these are the facts and we must examine them.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with what Mr Rehn said: that the Commission and the Council are in accord. They were not always in accord, Commissioner. In October 2002, the Commission said association negotiations should not commence. The Council imposed the decision unilaterally and that is what has brought us to the situation we are in today. I say this in order to restore the truth and set the record straight.</p>
<p class="contents">We Greeks are neighbours of the Albanians and, as you know, a neighbour knows more about the person next door than someone who lives elsewhere. What is the story here? The story is that Albania imposed the harshest of dictatorships on itself. When the peoples of eastern Europe were looking upon Stalin as a dictator, Albania thought he was very democratic and followed Mao Tse Tung. This has left a residue in the DNA of the people and, more importantly, the leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixteen years have passed, 16 years of democracy and yet the main church in the city of Premeti has still not been restored to Christianity. They are still using it as a house of commerce. Sixteen years later, in a European country, a country, Minister, just 500 kilometres from Austria. A church which was an Orthodox church for centuries has not been restored and they still retain it as a house of commerce. What answer is there to that? Is it not a fact that something is not working properly in this country?</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a country that last year – not before then, just last year – took two months to return the results of the elections. Can you imagine, Commissioner, Minister, Finland or Austria taking two months to return the results of elections? Elections were held in Albania on 2 July and the results came out on 2 September, meaning that the democratic construct is not working properly, that something is not right in the public administration sector in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">There are Greek contractors in Albania who do not recognise the legal government of Mr Berisha today, or Mr Fatos yesterday as the leadership; they recognise the mafia, because if they do not pay taxes to the mafia, they blow up the building site. There are Greek companies which have invested several million euros and, precisely because they could not stand the mafia which imposed its own extortionate taxes, they are abandoning their building sites and machinery and moving out.</p>
<p class="contents">One in three cars checked at the borders by the Greek police is carrying hashish. That is the percentage. How can we have such a country which cannot organise its state? I agree that we must all try to help this country find its way, but if we believe that it is mature, then I greatly fear that we shall find ourselves in trouble. The time is not yet right.</p>
<p class="contents">We come here, the civilised people of Europe, the representatives of the people of Europe, and decide not to let Serbia into the Union but to let Albania in. We do not let Serbia in because Mrs Ponte was against it; but Mrs Ponte did not want Croatia and, if Austria had not imposed a veto on Turkey last year, Croatia would still be outside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So Mrs Ponte comes along and dictates which country will accede and which will not accede to the European Union. Is that not the truth? How can we want Albania to accede and to keep out Serbia, which has a better organised state and better rates of development and more culture? Is that not the truth? Now, a short while ago, the Commissioner made a stylish but material admission that this is the reason Serbia is not joining the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to face the facts, that this is a country with high levels of crime which the government cannot control. The government may have the intention of controlling it, but it is not in a position to do so, because it is beyond its capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, trafficking in children cannot be controlled. In 2006 we have trafficking in children, for goodness sake. There is a great deal of drug trafficking and, of course, apart from anything else, and this is a political issue which I believe, with guidance, will be brought under control, there is rampant chauvinism which is not confined solely to Kosovo or Skopje, where we saw disruptions a few years ago, but is directed against Greece. The President of the Hellenic Republic went on an official visit and the Albanian Muslims booed him and there were incidents and a terrible hullabaloo.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore examine the issue of chauvinism which characterises this country and the issue of the freedom of the press. When a country is deprived of the freedom of the press, it is deprived of basic rights. We must therefore look very carefully before we leap. This country needs education and strict schooling before it accedes to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For years, the image of Albania in Italy has been one of barges and motorboats full of desperate men and women who, spurred on by poverty and pain, reach the Adriatic coast exhausted in search of a future that would be impossible in their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1995 I took part in an international volunteering and solidarity camp during the most critical and difficult period, and I still have a vivid picture in my mind of the people’s dull, spiritless eyes. Today I can say that Albania is changing. I had the opportunity to visit the country just a few months ago and found an extraordinary will to be free; I met countless young students at Tirana University who, first and foremost, love their country. There is also an obvious desire for Europe, especially among the younger generation: they have a need, a desire and a conviction that they want to belong to a wider family, closing once and for all a chapter of history in which Albania was isolated from Europe and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Albania, the country of eagles, is an organic part of Europe, and not just geographically.

It was he who, by travelling there as a private citizen, was the first Western politician to break through Albania’s isolation. Anyone who remembers those days and the things then to be seen in Albania, and who has since revisited that country on many occasions will know what a tremendous journey Albania can look back on.</p>
<p class="contents">No other country in Europe has, in modern times, been so oppressed and isolated and endured such persecution, whether for the sake of religion or of intellectual freedom, even though its people played a vital part in the cultural history of medieval Europe, including among their own number Skanderbeg, the last great European to fight for freedom from the Ottomans, and also – with the League of Prizren – in that of the 19th and 20th centuries, only to be betrayed by Europe at the Congress of Berlin – in other words, a country that was among the first victims not only of Fascism but also of Communism, and which is only now beginning to return to its place at the European table.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, no matter how justified our criticisms and irrespective of the need to reinforce democracy and the rule of law, we have to acknowledge that no European people in recent history has had such a tough time of it as it found its way to European structures, and that is why it needs all the solidarity we can offer. I am not talking here only about the state, but about the infrastructure as well; this is a country that needs massive support from us in building roads, in establishing cross-border links with Kosovo, and in connecting up to energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo will, in the long term, become less one-sidedly dependent on Belgrade if it is able to cooperate and communicate appropriately across the borders with its Albanian and Montenegrin neighbours. Overcoming the isolation to which this country was brutally subject will be a substantial task for a generation, if not for more than one of them, and I can do no other than marvel at the courage with which the government under Sali Berisha has got to grips with it. I am quite sure that Prime Minister Berisha has learned much from the mistakes that were made in the past, and that his approach to things is a quite different one.</p>
<p class="contents">However necessary criticism might be, we are perfectly justified in taking a somewhat optimistic view of things and giving this country the backwind that it deserves on the grounds not only of its tragic history, but also of its potential, which, economically speaking, is considerable, for it is a young country with a young population, speaking many languages and with a new outlook, who are determined to accept a challenge sadly denied to their ancestors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that the Agreement will help strengthen the process of political, economic and institutional stabilisation in Albania and will help strengthen civil society, the process of democratisation and public administration reforms. Something that I consider very significant is the emphasis placed by the Agreement on developing regional cooperation, and I should like to focus on this point for a couple of minutes. The main aspects of this cooperation should be to strengthen political dialogue with all of Albania’s neighbours and also to create a free trade area in Southeast Asia. </p>
<p class="contents">The experience of the Central European countries that joined the Central European Free Trade Agreement demonstrated that it was precisely this free trade area that, to a large extent, helped pave the way for those countries to join the EU. A further important aspect of this kind of regional cooperation is the gradual introduction of fundamental EU freedoms, including the free movement of capital, services, goods and of course persons. The introduction of such freedoms should significantly strengthen overall cooperation across the region, including cooperation between Albania and the aforementioned Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. For these reasons, I warmly welcome the fact that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement explicitly states that Albania’s readiness to conclude agreements of this nature with its neighbours will be one of the conditions for further developing relations between Albania and the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that the mind boggles sometimes when I read Parliament’s motions for resolutions. Generally, I agree that the most important thing is for all Balkan countries to have the opportunity to conclude agreements with the EU. Concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first step. It is wonderful that three years ago, in June 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council consolidated Europe’s position on Albania. I am not entirely sure whether the progress achieved is comparable with other countries in the region. There has been no review of the efficiency of the state, no assessment of economic development, of the situation at the borders or of the building of genuine economic and political structures. It is clear that, in comparison with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania is a stable country. Comparison with Macedonia is similarly favourable. I am of course not sure whether highly porous borders, large-scale migration and problems with law enforcement, together with specific difficulties in foreign trade and a near collapse in energy supplies are even partially acceptable for a country aspiring to sign an EU Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I advocate the provision of more EU aid for developing the legal system, in the broadest sense of the term, including practical action on the customs and finance police, which will contribute to stabilising the legal system. Given that my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, supports bringing Balkan countries closer to the EU, we shall be supporting the motion, despite the aforementioned reservations regarding Albania’s level of preparedness in respect of signing the proposed Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The agreement in question extends the European plan for security, stability, democracy, the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights to the area of the Western Balkans; a plan of good governance, respect for minority rights and the consistent cultivation of good neighbourly relations, a plan of economic reform, development and the modernisation of infrastructures, open to cross-border cooperation and to regional, economic and political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution by the European Parliament formulates the facts, listing the shortcomings and describing the prospects. The challenge of the somewhat new dynamic relations between the European Union and Albania consists in the gradual qualitative adaptation of Albania to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>of principles, values, rules and conduct. It also consists in strengthening public institutions, more intense technocratic efficiency and definitively bridging the confidence gap between agents with reforming intentions and the citizens of Albania. Lastly, the challenge consists in bridging the gap between formal acceptance and real application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the required adjustment, administrative, police and judicial modernisation in order to combat organised crime and corruption, the greatest possible participation of civil society in the political process and the establishment of viable and transparent mechanisms for the operation of the market economy are vying for first place.</p>

<p class="contents">The path of Albania towards the European Union is probably the rockiest one in comparison with other countries of the continent. The 20th century was not kind to the country, which was at the very bottom in terms of many economic and social indicators even before World War II. Later, the term ‘Albanianisation’ emerged as a synonym for the isolationist policy that was enforced by the then regime and that was also associated with under-development. The scars of Albanian isolation from the world are still much deeper than in any other post-Communist state.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Albania, just as other Western Balkan countries, is attracted by the magnetism of the European Union. Namely this attraction is accelerating reforms, strengthening democracy and human rights, and thus improving the lives of citizens. However, during my visit to Albania I noticed the crackling tension between the majority and the opposition, targeted not at competition but rather at the desire to destroy each other. They easily promise half of the state budget to combat corruption and crime, but no specific results have yet materialised.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cooperation to overcome the ghosts of the past should be the area where Albania demonstrates the flexibility and European character of its foreign policy. The decisive stages of negotiations concerning the status of Kosovo will become a litmus test revealing Tirana’s constructive position or the very opposite. I have no doubt that this will also determine whether Albania is mature enough for EU membership, which in any case is still far off.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and sharing the experience of the states which were successful in approaching and joining the European Union, should help Albania reach a decisive turn on the path towards Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In theory, this means a first step towards accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, that country was weighed down by the most backward and dictatorial form of Communism. It is, therefore, in itself, a good thing that Albania is being integrated in the large European family. There are, however, instruments for doing this other than EU membership, and the first instrument that springs to mind is European neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Albania is facing enormous problems. Economic problems, of course, and I would, for example, draw your attention to the fact that no less than 60% of the active population are employed in the agricultural sector. There is the problem of organised crime, people-trafficking and the drugs trade. There is also the problem of the existence of Al-Qaeda cells in Albania. In a predominantly Islamic country such as Albania, we also notice unacceptable practices, including bloodfeuds.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s absorption capacity is something we have recently discussed more and more, with good reason. As it happens, there is certainly no support structure in place for the accession of a country such as Albania, not now nor in 15 or 20 years, and so it is better that we do not give the Albanians expectations which we in the European Union cannot deliver upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, according to the most recent readings of the Euro barometer, the public opposition to Albania’s possible accession is about the same as it is to Turkey’s. It will therefore not be the first time that public opinion in Europe appears to have more common sense than those responsible for making policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is positive both for this country and for the area of the Balkans and southeast Europe as a whole. If we isolate Albania, we condemn it to remain a state in which and from which crime and corruption flourish and are exported. I do not think that such a policy is to anyone's benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, through a policy of rapprochement and through the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, we are giving Albania incentives to move in the direction of respect for human rights, economic reform and stronger rule of law and democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, over recent years, despite the obstacles and difficulties, Albania has, generally speaking, moved forward. That is why we are signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in question. Nonetheless, it is also true that, at the same time, there are a great many problems in this country. My honourable friends have already referred to corruption, to problems in relation to the freedom of the press and to the way in which electoral rolls and so forth are prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for my part, wish to comment on three individual issues which I consider to be of crucial importance and I believe that, with cooperation in particular between the European Commission and Albania, they can be overcome and resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is compliance on the part of Albania with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Progress has been already been made on setting up a state minorities committee, on granting permission, for example, to set up a private Greco-Albanian school in Himara and so forth. However, other issues remain, Commissioner, such as the translation of legislation into minority languages, the signposting of local traditional names, an increase in personnel dealing with minority issues and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission must concern itself directly with these issues and to record them objectively in its annual report published in October.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the census of the population, an objective census of the population which will adequately record the size of the minorities and not give rise to doubts as to its accuracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue that I wish to emphasise is the restoration of and compensation for property because, even though the law on this issue was passed back in 2004, there is a problem of lack of transparency, abuse and procedural irregularities. In the area of Himara in particular, there is the serious issue of the property of the Greek minority.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, emphasising again that I believe in the European prospects of Albania and voting for this agreement, I believe that the time has come to move from theory to practice. It is the responsibility of the European Commission to put what is contained in the text into practice with pressure on and cooperation with the Albanian authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Mr Ilves and believe that the agreement will allow us to develop more direct political relations with Albania, with a view to achieving a free trade zone; the movement of workers, capital and services; freedom of establishment; and, in future, the lasting stabilisation of south eastern Europe as an area of peace, democracy and security.</p>
<p class="contents">With this agreement we are calling on Albania to bring its legislation more into line with that of the European Union, not only in sectors such as the internal market, but also as regards justice, security and respect for rights. It is precisely because of this agreement that Albania has made significant progress and is now, in my opinion, more likely to overcome the numerous problems that still remain in that country regarding electoral law and media freedom, as well as on the corruption and organised crime front.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, this agreement falls within a broader perspective, relating above all to the launch of a Euro-Adriatic strategy that should include the resumption of infrastructure projects such as corridor 8 and, more generally, the pursuit of the goal and historic mission of EU enlargement. In strategic terms, the project to unify the continent according to the principles of democracy, peace and development must include Albania and the Balkans as leading players in the new Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Development in Albania has followed a similar path to that in other states undergoing transformation. The structures of organised crime were established more speedily and efficiently than those of the state, and the effects of that are being felt all over Europe. Albania is a country of origin for international criminal organisations dealing in drugs, trafficking in people, laundering money and thereby funding terror, and it is also through Albania that such organisations pass; that being the case, and in view of the fact that we suffer the effects, joint engagement with Albania is in the interests of both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Having seen it for myself, I can tell the House that Mr Berisha’s government is getting stuck in by prioritising an internal security programme and making use of its cooperative arrangements with Europe, for example in police projects with PAMECA (Police Assistance Mission of the EU to Albania), in customs and justice projects at parliamentary level, and, in particular, of the support given by the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe under its special coordinator Erhard Busek. There has been tangible progress, but the problems – and the challenges – are still enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">This stabilisation and association agreement is, for Albania, a milestone as it progresses towards European standards; the message it sends out is not only political, but also signifies practical help and cooperation. It is now for Albania to put into discharge in full the obligations of this agreement. I hope that it will use this opportunity to improve its legal system, to train judges and prosecutors, to improve law enforcement and the prosecution of crime, the control of borders at sea and on land and cooperation between police forces.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that there will be enhanced cooperation between the EU and South-Eastern Europe, and I would particularly like to see Albania playing its part in developing the SECI Centre in Bucharest, which is a base for cooperation between police forces that could be the seedbed for something like a South-East European version of Europol and present an opportunity for combating organised crime. Agreements, and the implementing of agreements, represent both a major challenge and an opportunity, not only to Albania, but also to us, to the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Albania, with its population of three-and-a-half million Muslims in the centre of the European continent is an important bridge for building a future Europe based on intermingling of cultures and tolerance for different religious traditions and civilisations. The EU Agreement gives Albania the opportunity to modernise, to build a lasting democracy, and for economic reform. A direct benefit will be the creation of a free trade zone, the rule of law and a functioning market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The present stage of relations between the European Union and Albania have set the political elite and Albanian civil society new tasks and perspectives. There are three problems I would like to draw your attention to:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly there is the question of dealing with nationalism, and the strategic political attempts appealing for a Greater Albania in other countries of the Western Balkans which have been addressed to the Albanian population. Albania now needs to re-direct its national interests towards European integration and peaceful co-existence within the European community, and to reflect on its own history and its role in the modern world. It needs to travel the road that other European nations have travelled in the last fifty years.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the rule of law, combating organised crime, and increasing the level of democracy. Albania has to ensure that the rights of national, ethnic and religious minorities are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem is women’s rights. There needs to be an effective policy guaranteeing women safety and equality. There must be an end to violence against women in the family, and to eliminate the negative phenomena which Amnesty International referred to in its report of 30 March this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By means of this Agreement, Albania will be sealing its future in Europe. I am convinced that, following Albania’s ending of its political isolation years ago, this agreement will now allow it to make rapid progress, both economically and socially, and that it will do this from a European perspective. However, the journey will not be an easy one.</p>
<p class="contents">As indicated in the European partnership adopted by the Council with Albania earlier this year, Albania has several objectives to meet, both in the short-term and over a number of years. It must be clear that a global and courageous reform is required in the country, so that these objectives can be achieved; a root and branch reform, so to speak, in several sectors, in particular with regard to the administrative capacity of Albania’s public administration. Greater progress is required with regard to the civil rights of the Albanian people and in the justice sector. To change a country and a society in this way is certainly not easy, but neither is it impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, Malta, also went through a similar change. Over a period spanning almost twenty years it has undergone a phenomenal transformation. However, the difficult road we embarked upon enabled us to meet the Copenhagen criteria, thus allowing us to join the European family within the European Union, just as many other countries did. Albania should look upon this Agreement as an extremely important step which will lead it to its natural home, that is, to membership of the European Union. Today this Parliament should send a clear message to the Albanian people, the message that the European Parliament is closely following the developments affecting the Albanian people and that they can count on our support and good will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is without a doubt in the interests of the European Union that it should help countries such as Albania to achieve greater political, social and economic stability, and we must not, while doing this, overlook the fact that, since Albania borders on Greece, which is an EU Member State, any attempt to bring Albania closer to the EU is the most obvious thing in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the reforms already implemented, there are still great challenges ahead for the Albanian economy, in which agriculture and related sectors play a considerable part, still accounting for a significant share – 24% – of the gross domestic product. Many Albanians live from subsistence farming and only a few products are exported. Many farms do not produce enough to be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that it is very important that the standards for veterinary checks, pesticides, labelling and the registration of animals applicable to products intended for export should be improved and complied with. It follows that anything that can be done to help promote the development of agriculture and of rural areas is to be supported, with particular attention also needing to be given to structural change and the problems posed by people moving away from rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I regard the stabilisation and association agreement as an appropriate instrument for drawing countries such as Albania closer to the European Union and to its values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the main practical measures connected with strengthening this perspective is obviously visa flexibility, and we support the aim to have the mandates for talks on a visa flexibility agreement adopted by the Council during the last six months of this year and for these talks to be concluded with all the countries in the Western Balkans some time next year.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said often in this debate, much has been done in Albania to strengthen its European perspective, but there is still a lot to be done. It is one thing to draft legislation, but it is quite another to implement it, not to speak of cultural change, which normally takes even longer. It has to be said once again that the Council is expecting Albania to step up measures, especially with regard to promoting freedom of the media, the return of property and compensation being paid, improved administration, the protection of minorities, and ensuring that local elections are held in accordance with international norms. Change, which Albania has already experienced and will experience again, is not easy, and that means that a lot of work needs to be done. It is mainly Albania which holds the keys to the solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that more resolute and determined reform efforts must be undertaken by Albania, as well as efforts to build up properly functioning institutions and a democratic culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Ilves, that this provides Albania with a golden opportunity to reform the country in line with the rule of law and all democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Pack, I also noted the tense situation in the country over the summer and the parliamentary boycott by the opposition. I am, however, pleased that a new political agreement was reached last week, reflecting a new consensus on media and electoral reform. I take this as a sign of the increased maturity of Albania’s political culture, and this must be pursued further in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked what the Commission’s position is on the progress in electoral reform in Albania. The Commission has underlined, both to the Government and to the opposition, the need to restart discussions without delay in the Ad Hoc Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reform. We have reiterated that reform discussions should take into account the recommendations of the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, following last year’s parliamentary election.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree fully with Mr Hatzidakis that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement helps us to coach the country towards European standards as regards electoral reform.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a question about the magnetism of the European Union and what our view is of any possible application for membership from Albania. On behalf of the Commission and the Union, I have made it clear to Albania’s political leadership and to the general public of that country that a sustained track record of successful implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as a tangible track record of reforms and their implementation on the ground, must be established over time before any consideration of further formal steps towards the European Union is possible. Implementation, implementation and implementation should be the name of the game in Albania now as regards its European aspirations. This concerns especially the need to fight organised crime and corruption. The Government of Albania has demonstrated a strong will to make serious progress in that field. Efforts have to be sustained and in such a way that they do not violate democratic and fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will report on Albania’s progress in the context of this year’s enlargement package in October or November. I am very glad that the European Parliament has invested a lot of time and energy in monitoring and pursuing political dialogue with Albania. I am sure that together we can achieve positive results in terms of coaching Albania towards its European future.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the Members who have underlined the importance of visa facilitation for the countries of the Western Balkans, including Albania. The Commission made its proposals for the negotiating mandates for the Western Balkans on visa facilitation in July. I am very glad that the Finnish Presidency intends to secure the adoption of those mandates before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Albania already has a readmission agreement in place, so I sincerely hope that a visa facilitation agreement can be negotiated swiftly and then soon implemented. It would be good for civil society and business – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – and for students, researchers and all citizens. It would contribute to the Europeanisation of Albanian civil society, which is our common goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
