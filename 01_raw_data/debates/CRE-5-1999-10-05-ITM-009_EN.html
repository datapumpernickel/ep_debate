<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. </span>–<span class="italic"> (IT)</span> Madam President, less than three weeks ago, you expressed your confidence in this Commission. At that time, I took on a series of commitments and I am happy to stand before you as proof that a new era of cooperation between our institutions has begun. I can see that it does not draw large crowds, but major objectives are never straightforward. </p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission has just ended its third meeting and I would like to summarise its results. The first important topic concerns advertising A1 posts. Last week, we started to make a series of substantial changes at the highest administrative levels in the Commission, on the basis of a complete cultural change in appointment methods. I would especially like to stress that we have stipulated that, at regular intervals, low-level managers and their responsibilities will be coordinated and that the nationality of the outgoing member of staff will not be a factor in the appointment of their successor.</p>
<p class="contents">After transferring a certain number of directors-general last week, we decided today to advertise the following vacant positions: directors-general of the Directorates-General for Enterprise Policy, Agriculture and Education and Culture; vice-directors-general of the following Directorates-General: Education and Culture, Competition and Foreign Relations. These positions will be taken up in accordance with the new procedures. I insisted that these procedures must be transparent and that after the initial selection, appointments are made on merit. This fact is extremely important. This will also enable those outside the Commission to express their views. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the Commission has discussed the situation as regards the implementation of the 1999 budget and noted that there are sectors where we need a transfer before the end of the year. The specific proposals only concern the redistribution of commitment appropriations. The main aim is to take the burden off amending and supplementary budget 4/99, adopted on 16 September, by proposing the financing of more appropriations in line with the Commission’s proposal made at that time. These are: EUR 98 million for PHARE, EUR 68 million for TACIS, EUR 15 million for humanitarian aid to Turkey, EUR 21 million for Kosovo, EUR 20 million for cooperation with South Africa and EUR 10 million for the environment and tropical rainforests. These increases will be financed through the reallocation within Category 4 of EUR 155 million and the transfer from Category 3 of EUR 10 million. </p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the Commission’s programme up to the end of January. We have stressed the importance of a good work programme. In line with this commitment, the Commission has reviewed the areas where a decision of the College must take effect before the end of January 2000. In this way, we will be able to communicate our programme commitments to you and to the European Council, so that you can keep it in mind when planning your work programme for the coming months. I will present Parliament with the five-year perspectives in January 2000, as we agreed here, after which our annual programming will return to its normal rhythm. I would like to add that I will be strict with my colleagues in the way they deal with the Commission services. The Commission demands quality, well-prepared proposals and understandable texts, above all – I repeat – understandable texts. The Commission is not a secretariat which must follow specific interests. We want to renew our role as the driving force of Europe and so we want to act as a College. Our programme is the one we proposed to you and we will present it in an analytical and comprehensive way. </p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is about the report on the competitiveness of European industry. The Commission has adopted the annual report on the competitiveness of European industry which deals with structural changes. We have also examined some reports devoted to the steel and forestry industries. I must add that both myself and Commissioner Liikanen intend to work in such a way that, in future, the Commission can concentrate on the more horizontal issues in business policy, because we now leave discussions on individual industries to other decision-making bodies. </p>
<p class="contents">The fifth point concerns the new strategy for the internal market. With the help of a comprehensive report by Commissioner Bolkenstein, we have examined the priorities facing the internal market over the next five years. The action plan ended this year. The aim of the communication is to establish the potential objectives and the possible actions geared to the internal market over the next five years. We are counting on incorporating the most valuable element of the previous action plan, the so-called scoreboard framework of the internal market, and we intend to guarantee that there are sound procedures to assess, monitor and adjust the objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be glad to welcome comments and reactions before making a definitive decision at the end of November, since today’s presentation is included in a communication procedure. Therefore, there will be a debate with Parliament and various times for consultation, and only in November will we arrive at a, let us say, operative proposal. This is another chapter where cooperation with Parliament is of the utmost importance. Just in the last few minutes, Commissioner Verheugen explained how we are starting to prepare the decisions which we will make next week on enlargement. This too is just a procedural explanation but it concerns the most important issue we have to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week, we must approve all the reports on the progress of relations with the applicant countries. Commissioner Verheugen has already been in contact so that the parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs can be immediately informed about the situation. During next week, we will touch on one of the most important subjects for the whole of the Commission’s five-year term of office: we are starting the actual enlargement process. </p>
<p class="contents">These were the subjects we discussed today, as well as numerous procedural aspects that are always discussed in Commission meetings that it is not appropriate to go into in Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">And finally, I would like to ask a question regarding the budget: bearing in mind that almost all transferrals involve Category 4, that is, the external activities of the Union, and that is one of the points that produces most dissatisfaction in my group and, in general, in the Committee on Budgets.

As for the second point, I would say that today we are limited to urgent reforms on the matters which are, as we have seen, absolutely extraordinary. If we re-read the list of the measures we find Turkey, and all the urgent cases which made it essential to alter the budget. We have not in any way reanalysed the major items of expenditure in the budget. If we look at that item, then I must say, Mr Barón Crespo, that it is not only external policy expenditure which must be reallocated, but I would say that we must reallocate all items in the budget. In all honesty, the structures in the budget are more faithful to their historical origins than to the needs of the future, but I think this is one of the three or four challenges that we must face together. So I am not responding to the single item because I do not feel like it, but I accept your invitation, Mr Barón Crespo, because when I myself start to examine the large expenditure percentages, I find that past rather than future needs are dictating our path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We understand that you have discussed the progress reports which are to be published next week. Now, part of this progress towards enlargement – that concerned with cooperation on legal matters and between countries of the EU as it stands at present – is not being overseen by the Commission but by the Council of Ministers. All right, so we know this, but will any progress within this area be described in your reports? Or is there a risk of the Council not making it public? It would be very worrying if that were the case and if we in Parliament or our opposite numbers in the countries which are candidates for accession to the European Union were unable to study the progress made. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, another small question by the way, Mr President of the Commission. Have you anything against your letter to Prime Minister Lipponen about the Tampere Summit being published? It has been published in Sweden, and I imagine that you, with your policy of openness, would not object to its being published. Prime Minister Lipponen, however, refuses to let it be published in Finland. How do you view this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have the feeling that the individual Governments in the various Member States do not share your desire. I refer, for example, to the type of administration of the budget funds that we transfer to the various Member States. In our case, in Italy, they go via committees within the Ministry of Industry, for example. But it is difficult to have access to them, despite the work we do in the committees, in order to ensure that the funds, in ever greater measures, are transferred to the Member States. </p>

I would only remind you that the cultural revolution needs more time. Here we have only changed some posts which it was essential to change because we had to give an example of mobility, for countries and people. We had to show that the posts are not anyone’s fixed prerogative. So we have made these ten changes which are, however, of fundamental importance. </p>
<p class="contents">I, like you, looked at the issue of women and there have been great difficulties in dealing with this at this stage. The problem, however, is worse still, Mrs Hautala, because the situation is very difficult, even with reshuffles. Either we really change policy, in employment and career procedures, or we cannot see the matter through to its conclusion. So this is one of the themes we must talk about in the cultural revolution, and one that we must discuss with the administration. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make one more remark. The issue of the cultural revolution of the administration goes deeper than we might think. I came here from outside the institutions, observed with great curiosity the type of administrative structure in place, and I have to say that we need to discuss the basic philosophy of this administration. Every new political and administrative situation created in the world has always found new strength in its administration. Here however, the administration has grown by a process of stratification and has not looked to the future. The cultural revolution lies here, not in changing only ten directors. The major challenge goes much deeper, and calls for us to work intellectually too, in a direction that is still unknown. However, in studying all this, I have realised that there has been no effort to create an administration for the duties the Commission must perform.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I understand correctly, you are alluding to the problems of tax harmonisation. Just now, in the Commission meeting which has just finished, Commissioner Bolkenstein summarised, in a way I believe to be absolutely correct and precise, why there are some items of fiscal policy which do not need to be harmonised, which thrive on diversity, for example personal income taxes. There are other items, such as value added tax, which call for a certain amount of harmonisation, because otherwise, there would be problems with competition. There are still more items, on company taxation and taxation on financial revenue which instead must be harmonised where the lack of harmonisation leads to a distortion of competition. This is a general statement, but it is clear that within this, a thousand individual items must be created because then each of these general items splits into many specific issues that it is not appropriate to discuss here. The basic philosophy, however, seems to be this: there are some subjects which upset or violate competition and so we must have thorough harmonisation. However, I think that harmonisation would be harmful for other items, which is not the case in the current States where we even find diversity from region to region. </p>
<p class="contents">This doctrine is simple and also very clear because it is in line with decentralisation, which we believe to be a Commission doctrine that we have all accepted and share.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are dealing with a very serious and very important question of procedure.

I think that the most serious thing is for us to lay down these rules in a small committee. Certainly the President is available in all important and necessary cases, otherwise, and quite rightly, the level of debate they say, will drop. Of course, if more minor questions are asked, then we will have to lower, quite rightly, the debate to the level of the matters in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in my opinion we have three levels: the President, specific Commissioners devoted to different areas and routine, which must be conducted in the fastest and most transparent way possible – using the Internet or written communications – because it does not merit being the subject of a debate. We must preserve direct communication when there is going to be a debate.

The problem is that the Commission works at a really intensive rate and so it is impossible to say, ten days ahead of the Commission’s meeting, what the precise agenda will be. However, as regards the important subjects that we will be discussing, the ones that can be prepared in advance, we have already begun to set down the framework for our future work. This is a commitment that I just made in my address, that is, to lay out the framework of our work up to the end of the year so that we can work together on major topics. Last minute changes are made to the agenda but there is nothing secret about this. It is just difficult to communicate these changes when we ourselves only know that urgent facts have come up a few minutes before the start of the meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that this would be high on his agenda and that the need was for structural change in European industry. I would suggest to Mr Prodi that many economists believe that the most important factors for competitiveness in industry would be, first of all, a reduction in corporate and employment taxes and secondly, a reduction in the enormous and indeed intolerable burden of regulation which puts Europe at a great disadvantage in relation to other parts of the world. We have a European employment programme which is based on four pillars. None of those four pillars will make a significant impact on unemployment in the short term. The solutions for unemployment are exactly the same as the solutions for competitiveness, that is, reduced employment taxes and reduced levels of regulation. What attitude will the Commission take to these points? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with the points you made: the reduction in corporate taxes and their harmonisation are useful for European competition, as is employment tax. </p>
<p class="contents">However, if you asked me what the primary factor in Europe’s industrial problems is, I would be very frank: the human resources problem as the incentive for entrepreneurship that exists on our continent and, therefore, the whole problem of preparing the financial structures for new entrepreneurship. I therefore think that the human factor is top of the list of our problems in developing production and the fiscal factor is extremely important. We can give them equal importance if you like, but certainly the human resources issue is, in my opinion, of huge importance for our continent. If we do not take urgent measures using a very broad programme in this sector, I believe that not even reducing taxes, which would represent substantial action and can make a strong contribution, will be sufficient to bring about growth in European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would never judge the matters raised by my colleagues, but I would like to say that these talks with the Commission should perhaps keep to the Commission’s discussion and their decisions, otherwise, we risk running over into another section which will soon begin – Question Time. So I think that if we want to make this time meaningful, we must keep it as we initially wanted it to be. </p>
<p class="contents">A quick question to President Prodi on the organisation chart. In the second Wise Men’s report, there is a point which concerns national interests which have supposedly been organised to some degree in the Commission. I think that for an institution like the Commission there is nothing worse, along with fraud, than this: the thought that there is no impartiality or supranationality. Does the policy you have begun concerning directors-general also consist of examining, tackling and facing up to the issue of the Commission’s impartiality and independence? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been criticised by everyone, starting with the Italian press, not to mention the Spanish press and the French press, while the Germans have criticised me in speech as well as in writing. Therefore, either we have done everything badly or we have done everything well. All things considered, I do not know. I would like to stress, however, a very important point – why have we done this? Because there cannot be a truly European body if a specific post has been reserved for thirty years for one country or for twenty years for one person. Here the future of what we understand as Europe is at stake. So, in these cases, it is likely that mistakes will happen. It is also likely that high-level people will be sacrificed, but do you understand what is at stake? Do you understand what we are facing? We really are facing the future of a structure that must be as international as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, by making these decisions I have taken a risk, a very real risk, and this too is a sign for the future. I want to be clear that appointments must be made according to merit and sometimes they will upset or overturn certain balances between countries. But the future of Europe is at stake here, and it is already an extremely important consequence. I have seen it in people’s reactions. In fact, after discussing this with the representatives of various countries, with the people who objected, the consequence was this: we must invest more in training the young and we must put more energy into sending high-level officials to Brussels. This is what I wanted. To start a chain reaction so that this becomes the best bureaucracy in the world. It is clear that this is a challenge, along with what I said before in reply to Mr Cox’s question – to start creating a type of bureaucracy suited to the objectives we want to achieve and then choose the best people which will sometimes mean upsetting the balance between countries. However, I think that it is worth it for our future goal. </p>
