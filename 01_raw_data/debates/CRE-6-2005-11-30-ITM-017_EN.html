Some of the fallout is probably reflected in the new framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament, notably that if Parliament were to withdraw its confidence in any Member of the Commission, the President will either sack that Commissioner or come before Parliament and explain why not.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is necessary too for Parliament, as well as for the Commission, to reflect upon the outcome of the approval procedure. Parliament needs to do so from its own perspective. This report, passed by a large majority of the committee, will be the product of that review. The key to our resolve will be to secure an approval procedure that is transparent, fair and consistent; a procedure in which the Commission candidates disclose relevant information as to his or her professional capacity to do the job to which he or she will be assigned.</p>
<p class="contents">The report sets out our criteria for the assessment of candidates, including European commitment and the gender balance that is achieved across the whole team. It codifies the procedure for the approval process, the organisation of the hearings, the questions, the issues of transparency and the decision-making process of each committee. To achieve both greater clarity and coherence it is proposed that a joint meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs and the Conference of Presidents should be charged with the task of declaring the hearings closed. We assert our right to follow the same procedure should there be a casual vacancy from the Commission during its five-year mandate. Finally, we ask that the next parliamentary elections be brought forward from June to May 2009 so that we will have more chance to prepare the approval process properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, both Parliament and Commission have learned a great deal from our experience of 2004. The democratic accountability of the Union is hereby strengthened. I commend the report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to thank Mr Duff for his report, which has the – highly commendable – aim of rendering Parliament’s procedure for the hearings of Commissioners-designate transparent and coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">The hearings procedure is a political exercise used by the European Parliament to increase the democratic legitimacy of the Commission before Parliament. It is clear, therefore, that careful reflection is required when any changes to this procedure are proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">As everybody knows, in May last year the President of the European Parliament and the President of the European Commission signed an extremely important document, consisting of the framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework agreement, along with the Treaties, constitutes the essential reference point. In item 7 there is a specific provision on the appointment of the new Commission. Three principles which must be applied during the hearings are very clearly detailed there: the principle of transparency and openness, the principle of fairness and the principle of consistency. These principles were decided by common agreement and were signed last May by Parliament and the Commission, and must be applied throughout the entire procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I wish to draw the attention of the rapporteur and my fellow Members to two points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the consultation of the Commission President-designate in the context of the hearings procedure. The framework agreement explicitly provides that Parliament establish the framework agreement and arrange contact with the Commission President-designate, in good time and before the start of the approval procedure for the new Commission. It also lays down that Parliament must take account of any comments made by the President-designate, as stated also in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. For this reason, recital E of Mr Duff’s report should be interpreted in the sense that the President of the Commission has to be consulted in good time, thereby giving him the opportunity to be heard, and for any comments he has to be accorded due consideration. I therefore consider the formula set out by the rapporteur to be good.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the replacement of a member of the College. I personally am in favour of the principle, also set out in the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, according to which, in the case of a Commissioner being replaced during the College’s term of office, the relevant parliamentary committee has the right, as well as the duty, to meet and hear the new member of the Commission. This is unquestionably an important principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, however, to point out that, while the term ‘Commissioner-designate’ is used in the report, the current Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the new member of the College, in the case of a replacement, is not termed ‘Commissioner-designate’ but rather ‘full Commissioner’ right from the moment of his appointment. It is of course clearly understood that – even if a full Commissioner – the relevant parliamentary committee must meet and hear him before he can begin to carry out his term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the considerations I wish to leave for the rapporteur, as confirmation of the highly positive approach both the Commission and I myself take to the views expressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ritual is commensurate with the importance of the political act of approving the Commission, firstly, because its legitimacy is enhanced by more stringent guidelines; secondly because Parliament is increasingly involved in the process of forming the Commission, and accordingly plays a role that is far from being merely symbolic; and thirdly because it strikes a fresh balance between Europe’s political institutions, which incorporates the mechanisms of monitoring and responsibility inherent in a constitutional relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s procedure for approving the Commission now has a framework of standards establishing greater fairness in the Commissioner-designate hearings in the parliamentary committees and greater consistency in the final assessment, which is currently overseen jointly by the Conference of Presidents and the Conference of Committee Chairs. We need to ensure that democratic procedures do not have a merely formal or symbolic meaning. Rather, they are responsible for bringing the public’s values and wishes to the mechanics of the institutions, so that the Community can make an informed decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The more ambitious the European political process has become, the tighter it has also become. It therefore needs to be subject to intense scrutiny; it must lead to strong institutions and to leadership capable of taking a lead in pointing the way to the future. Europe no longer recognises itself without the increased transparency and legitimacy among its institutions, and without the requirements of integrity and responsibility demanded of everyone, but especially of political leaders, given that it is they who are responsible for the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Richard Corbett, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, one of the special features of the European Union is that its central administration does not just consist of faceless bureaucrats: it is headed by a political executive. The Commissioners are politicians who hold office thanks to the confidence they receive from the European Parliament, and only for as long as they continue to enjoy that confidence, because we can of course dismiss them in a vote of censure. That is essential to the political accountability of the system. It means that, unlike many international structures, our central administration – albeit small – is accountable. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The hearings are a very visible part of the process of the appointment of the Commission, which underlines this principle of accountability. It is something relatively new. It was not in the original Treaties. The fact that we have a vote of confidence on the Commission as a whole and that its term of office coincides with that of Parliament was brought in through the Maastricht Treaties and enhanced with the Amsterdam Treaty. The hearings are not even mentioned in the Treaties. We have built that up ourselves. It is now an accepted part of our procedure and one which is welcomed by all democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">This report essentially confirms the practice we have built up, but it brings in three small innovations. First, it limits the written questionnaire that is sent out by committees to Commissioners beforehand. These have tended to grow and grow and, frankly, seem to serve no particular purpose when we know in fact that they are answered in a rather bureaucratic way beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the report proposes that within Parliament we have a joint meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs and the Conference of Presidents of this House to make a global evaluation prior to the debate in plenary and to declare the process of hearings closed. They could, of course, declare it still to be open and ask for a further hearing with one or another designate Commissioner. That gives extra flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The third innovation is to call for the European elections to be brought forward from June to May, to give more time for this procedure. That is something we should be asking for anyway as a European Parliament, because ever since we enlarged the Union northwards it has been a bit silly to have our elections in June, which is the main holiday period in the northern countries. May would be a much better time in any case to have European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure has worked well. What happened last time showed that it worked well and we are not asking for a right of censure on individual Commissioners. What happened last time showed that there are ways and means of correcting queries about an individual Commissioner through the President of the Commission, whilst maintaining the collegiality of the Commission. It works. If it had not worked we would not have Mr Frattini here with us today to take part in this debate, and it is with pleasure that I welcome him.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome his comments. They were slightly grudging at some points. However, I noticed that he did not challenge the fact that this report is entirely compatible with the Interinstitutional Agreement. It is in that spirit that it was drafted and in which I am sure it will be adopted tomorrow by this Parliament. I thank the rapporteur and all those who helped with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was, of course, in 1994 that this House began the practice of hearings for those nominated to the Commission, and it was in 2004 at the latest that the public became aware of just how important the thorough examination of candidates for the office of Commissioner is, and above all of the fact that this House is not a governmental rubber-stamp.</p>
<p class="contents">The report provides Parliament with an important array of instruments for the future, and spells out in more precise terms what its rights are when it comes to the choice of the Commission. I particularly want to stress the fact that we will in future have clear criteria for the assessment of candidates, those being indubitable independence, knowledge of the relevant portfolio and, in particular, complete disclosure of all information on their financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in future, Parliament acts in accordance with these guidelines, it will certainly benefit the credibility of both institutions in the eyes of the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
