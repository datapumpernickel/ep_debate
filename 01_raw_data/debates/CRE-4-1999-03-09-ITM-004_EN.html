<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cabrol </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation that is before us concerns orphan medicinal products. Its purpose is to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to concentrate on the research and marketing of medicinal products which would not otherwise be marketed by the industry because they concern rare diseases affecting only a very few people, and are consequently not commercially viable. Tropical diseases, which affect so many who have no hope of paying, should also be included. That is the aim of Amendment No 2, which I support.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation raises two main issues and several secondary issues. The initial problem is that of definition. The first criterion is epidemiological, in this case diseases affecting no more than 5 per 10 000 of the population and, of course, serious, chronic and debilitating diseases. This is specified in Amendments Nos 3 and 7. Then there is a medical criterion which applies where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment for these diseases. I think that is an excellent criterion, and I reject Amendments Nos 33, 34, 35, 41, 42 and 43, which seek to limit diagnostic research to curable diseases, as if it were not important to be able to recognise a disease. That seems ridiculous, to doctors in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that of incentives. I think they will be effective, whether it be assistance in drawing up a research protocol, exemption from registration fees – supported by Amendments Nos 11, 14 and 21 – national incentives, fiscal for example, and above all market exclusivity for ten years, although with provision to reduce it to six years if certain criteria are no longer met or a clinically superior medicinal product is discovered. I shall not be supporting Amendments Nos 25, 28 and 31, which seek to remove this criterion, because I think it will be quite simple to observe in practice. In terms of obtaining excessive profit, I find the guarantee relevant. I shall therefore uphold that criterion against Amendments Nos 17, 32, 36, 37 and 39 which seek to remove it, but propose to pay the excessive profit – if there is one – to a research support fund for new orphan medicinal products. And I shall be supporting Amendment No 38, which makes it impossible to extend an authorisation to market a similar non‐orphan medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also in favour of a retroactive measure for orphan medicinal products presented before this regulation comes into force, in order to benefit the sick people concerned as early as possible. That is the aim of Amendment No 40. In accordance with the proposed regulation, the designation of these orphan medicinal products will be obtained from a special committee set up within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I support Amendment No 15, which calls for that Agency to receive a special contribution that is sufficient to cover the exemptions from registration fees and is intended to maximise the incentive to carry out research in the orphan medicinal products sector and submit these applications for authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this regulation is extremely important and useful as it will not only allow the treatment of diseases for which no diagnostic or therapeutic resources are currently available – and that includes vaccinations of course – but it will also lead to research in the pharmaceutical industry that will create employment, in particular in small and medium‐sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge you to vote for this regulation, taking into account, of course, the amendments I have mentioned.</p>

In accordance with a need felt by millions of patients, it aims to create favourable conditions at Community level for research into and the development and marketing of medicinal products to treat rare diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, the development of treatment possibilities for patients requires that the field of application of the regulation be extended as far as possible, in particular to new indications even for well‐known pharmaceutical products and forms of treatment. Since most of the applications come from small and medium‐sized enterprises, at least in the United States, it would be appropriate for the Commission to specify special conditions for the SMEs so as to step up the use of funds earmarked under the fifth framework programme and the programme of Community action on rare diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree completely with the idea of full access to the centralised procedure, without this becoming binding, and a partial or total exemption from the payment of fees to the Agency, provided that it is guaranteed an adequate supply of funds, and we would hope that this financial incentive would also be adopted by the Member States in the event of the mutual recognition procedure being applied. This should explicitly be laid down in the regulation, at least in the form of an emphatic recommendation to the Member States. Exclusivity is one of the lynchpins of any system of incentives and hence should be extended to every application, in particular to new indications for well‐known medicines, so as to encourage research in fields which otherwise would not be exploited for lack of adequate patent protection, provided that the criteria set out in Articles 3(1) and 3(2) are respected, especially in the case of well‐known drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of a ‘similar medical product" should be given a more detailed scientific definition in order to take into account current scientific developments and the characteristics of the products. Only through cooperation between the private and the public sector and the creation of favourable conditions for research into new medicines, with the help of treatment and diagnosis, can we respond to the patients" needs.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marinucci </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, Europe is finally catching up with the United States, which has for some time been encouraging the research, manufacture and marketing of medicinal products intended for the diagnosis and treatment of rare disorders which – although affecting only a small number of people – are serious, incapacitating and often fatal.</p>
<p class="contents">We note with satisfaction that the Commission has kept its word to Parliament and, after the adoption of the provisions on rare diseases, has presented to Parliament and the Council a draft regulation intended to steer the industry towards researching and manufacturing medicinal products which are unlikely to be profitable, given the narrow user base.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the European Union as an institution is meeting its commitment – laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and consolidated in the Amsterdam Treaty – to contribute to ensuring a high level of health protection for all European people; it is also, for humanity as a whole, assuming the responsibilities deriving from its economic and cultural strength. Biomedical science has made tremendous progress and yet, in the case of certain genetic diseases and rare disorders, our degree of impotence is unacceptable to patients' families, who feel abandoned and betrayed. The families have achieved a good deal by grouping together and organising themselves. Celebrities from political and artistic circles have joined them in collecting funds for research: we need only think of the growing role, year by year, of initiatives such as ‘Telethon'.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot shirk its duty, which is not to take over the role of private manufacturers in the individual Member States, but to draw all the necessary strands together. To this end, the measures provided for in this regulation will be complemented by Community funding under the fifth R&amp;D framework programme. The main incentives will be market exclusivity for ten years, awarded to the manufacturing company on certain conditions, assistance from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, exemption from paying all or part of the fees due, and the possibility of tax incentives – albeit at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Having pressed the Commission to present this proposal, the Socialist Group – to which I have the privilege of belonging – now supports it enthusiastically. We would stress that the final version of the regulation must prioritise scientific and humanitarian bodies rather than economic ones. In other words, the caution required in a field such as this must not cause difficulties in offering incentives or implementing the provisions, which must be formulated and read in such a way as to open the door wide to the research, manufacture and marketing of medicinal products to treat rare disorders.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Valverde López </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party, I should like to express our full support for the proposal for a regulation put forward by the European Commission. It responds to a social need and to long‐standing requests by patients" groups. Incidentally, I believe that those groups deserve special public commendation here and now, in the House, for their excellent support of the parliamentary work we all carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">For his part, Professor Cabrol has prepared an excellent report. We are happy to support its general approach and agree with its main conclusions. Nevertheless, we have tabled a number of amendments aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the regulation. I should also highlight the fact that there has been an excellent climate of cooperation and agreement amongst all the political groups represented in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is important to accept the amendment that allows the committee on orphan medicinal products envisaged in the Commission"s proposal to operate under the aegis of the European Agency for the Assessment of Medicines. This would lead to increased efficiency whilst the Commission"s powers would remain intact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to make adequate financial resources available in the European Union"s budget on a regular and permanent basis. Amendment No 18, which I tabled, aims to create a fund to promote innovation, Mr Bangemann. The intention here is to respond to the demands of efficiency and demands of an ethical nature. Once the period of special protection for these orphan medicinal products has elapsed, it is only reasonable that part of the income from them should be used to build up a fund which will continue to support this regulation and new orphan medicinal products. This will in fact provide better treatment and respond to what could be called society"s ethical demand for continued operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to study the operational experience gained in the United States and Japan. Our proposal must be in line with our own European identity and the restrictions imposed by Community legislation and our institutions. I believe it is workable, though it may be somewhat complicated. I hope that the Commission will welcome this idea with the high degree of efficiency we have come to expect of it and I should like to thank the Commission in advance.</p>

If we want to do more than simply fight a lot of very common diseases but also help those who suffer from one of the 5 000 identified rare diseases, then we have to give the necessary incentives to the industry. And we should not forget that today"s rare condition may become tomorrow"s far commoner disease. So we must encourage research into these rare diseases by assuring investors of a measure of exclusivity and allowing them advantageous tax treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation is certainly a step in the right direction, but I think the Commission needs to rethink its definition of ‘orphan medicinal products". A number of other Members as well as myself have tabled amendments on this. Perhaps a compromise amongst the various suggestions can produce a better definition.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with Mrs Dybkjær, I have also tabled an amendment which provides for the industry to be given an extra incentive in the case of a disease which has around three thousand sufferers in Europe. We suggest that the pharmaceutical industry should receive six months" additional patent protection for another medicinal product which it places on the market, if it develops a remedy to treat an extremely rare disease. I hope a majority of the House will back this amendment, and I would welcome Mr Bangemann"s opinion on it.</p>

Secondly, I want to say that I am particularly pleased about the creation of a Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. However, questions may arise as to the composition of this committee, the way it operates, and the real weight it will carry, in other words, at the end of the day, what resources will effectively be made available to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other point I need to mention. There has been an attempt to float the idea of unreasonable profits. I am no fanatical defender of profits for pharmaceutical industry multinationals. All the same, I find this idea utterly arbitrary. As regards the planned ten‐year period, if there is a review at the end of the fifth year – which seems appropriate – then rather than assess the profits it should check that the therapeutic indications have not been extended and that the prevalence has not changed. If these two factors are taken into account our group will vote for this resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">As the United States is now at the forefront of clinical and pharmacological research, it has become a model of contemporary society in several respects. That country has had extremely successful legislation on orphan medicinal products since 1983. The EU is now hoping to follow suit, through Professor Cabrol's report.</p>
<p class="contents">No fewer than 837 drugs have been designated ‘orphan medicinal products' in the US over the past decade. Research and experimentation on these products – which we are discussing today – has been facilitated in various ways, contributing to the identification and knowledge of previously unknown etiologies and hence their treatments.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is what incentives to offer the industry; the main one offered by the US authorities seems to me to be tax relief, which covers almost 50 % of clinical research.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, rare diseases are in fact well‐known diseases, although their low incidence of morbidity on the population places them in a limbo of unanswered questions. We support Professor Cabrol's attempt to get things moving and put the uncertainties behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, on the threshold of the third millennium, it is distressing to think of patients being prevented by the market from obtaining appropriate treatments. If this society of ours cannot express proper solidarity under such circumstances, then goodbye Europe!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Needle </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, first of all, and most importantly, I should like to add my strong support for both the Commission proposal and particularly Mr Cabrol's excellent report which is well drafted and pertinent, as his reports always are. As my colleague Mrs Marinucci has set out, we, on this side, will maintain our approach taken in committee. Providing meaningful incentives to ensure development of products to tackle some of the most debilitating and upsetting conditions in the world is clearly a job for a new kind of innovative, public/private partnership. To succeed, progress must be based on epidemiological and economic criteria which have been worked out in the rather difficult passage of these proposals to this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has rightly made provisions for unreasonable profit‐taking to be avoided. Although some within the pharmaceutical sector protest at the very thought that there might be any risk of that, it seems reasonable to myself and many others that the use of public resources and legal support should be absolutely transparent. Therefore I hope that Parliament and the Council will vote to maintain the concept as part of the partnership with research and development sectors and will include the practical means for the programme decision‐makers to reach fair, just and accurate conclusions which also bear in mind the generic development industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important development in the context of the many exciting advances being made in genetic identification, treatment and, best of all, prevention of diseases. Some of this work I saw for myself just last week in my own region. Together with the forthcoming programme on rare diseases, plus what I hope will prove an effective new framework for public health policy over the next five years, this initiative offers realistic new hope to those who suffer pain and misery.</p>
<p class="contents">Credit is therefore due to all those who have worked so hard to bring this proposal before us today. Now it is up to all of us to take responsibility for ensuring its future success on behalf of those patients who suffer.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liese </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present proposal for a regulation is certainly to be welcomed. The hopes of many patients suffering from rare diseases rely on our obtaining a regulation on orphan drugs in Europe too as soon as possible. We should be guided by the experiences of the USA and Japan. We should also learn from experience. In that sense, Mr Cabrol"s report proposes a series of improvements to the Commission proposal, although I do have problems with some of the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is most important that we also include tropical diseases in Amendments Nos 1 and 2. It is important for Europe to look further than the end of its own nose and also to consider people suffering from tropical diseases. That is not necessarily the case under this regulation, but we must create an instrument to do so very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have problems with the amendments that impose additional obstacles on industry in regard to obtaining orphan drug status for a particular medicine. This applies, for instance, to Amendment No 18, on which I would be interested to hear the Commission"s view. My impression is that if we siphon off the revenue obtained by industry after the ten‐year period, that will in turn reduce the incentive to invest in the first place and I would be interested to know whether things really work in the USA in the way suggested in that amendment. Personally I doubt it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to raise the question of diagnosis, which we have already had occasion to consider in committee. I believe I can say from my own experience that particularly in the case of genetically‐related diseases – which after all means most of the rare diseases – the patients are waiting for prevention and treatment while we, if we only have diagnosis but no corresponding prevention or treatment, sometimes actually produce problems. That is why I personally am in favour of giving priority to treatment and only supporting diagnosis if treatment or prevention are also available. For the rest, however, we should certainly support Mr Cabrol"s report and the proposal for a regulation and should not jeopardise the entire project by quarrelling about details.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tannert </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a German proverb that fits the bill in the EU as regards orphan drugs. It goes as follows: if you go on long enough, it will be alright in the end. It took the Commission long enough to present a proposal for a European orphan drug act. What I expect of this regulation is that it will provide a strong incentive for the development of these medicines and therefore for research into molecular biology. Unfortunately, the Commission felt it was unable to follow the US model in regard to providing additional tax relief, tax relief at least in the sense of definite recommendations for action on the part of the Member States. I would certainly be interested to know whether the Commission sees any possibility of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">But experiences in the USA show that tax advantages offer the most effective stimulus for investment in orphan drug development. In general terms, the reasons for EU‐wide tax harmonisation are accumulating by the day and the orphan drug regulation is another reason. It would also be a good idea to set up a special fund for additional support for the development of these medicines. There are no bounds to what we could imagine here, even if a certain amount of state dirigisme is required to achieve our aims.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, we are very happy about the very positive response to our proposal. The rapporteur has done much towards achieving this, thanks to his very careful work. Since we are now at first reading, I will not go into all the amendments tabled. Instead, I will take up the most important ones that were raised during the discussion and explain why the Commission does not regard some of them as very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, everyone realises – and this became clear during the discussion – that we need this proposal because market mechanisms alone cannot produce useful results in the cases we are dealing with here, the so‐called orphan drugs. And that is perfectly understandable. The fact is that research in particular is becoming increasingly expensive and if by definition this expenditure cannot be recouped at all, then of course nobody working in the private sector can be expected to take it on board.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, we have been trying for many years to control and counter this situation. It is not the case that nothing has been done in past years. We have made quite substantial funds available for research in these areas in the research programmes, in the third and fourth framework programmes of research. The fact that we are only now proposing this regulation – I believe the American legislation has existed since 1983 – does not mean that we have done nothing since then. But it is clear that with the experience we have gained from America we can perhaps present an improved proposal now.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is easy to describe. Since there are no economic incentives, we have to compensate for this. Of course we can do so directly through support for research, and we shall continue to do so in future. Even more emphasis has been put on this kind of research in the fifth framework programme. In that respect the situation there has not changed, and if it has, only for the good.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also want to create a range of additional incentives, for instance through the ten‐year market exclusivity right. This kind of market exclusivity right does of course offer an additional opportunity to make profits, but since this market is by definition very small, nobody can in fact count on making enormous profits. On the contrary, the opportunities to do so will be fairly restricted. Nevertheless, these ten years are a key element and cornerstone of our system of incentives for research and development in the area of orphan drugs, which indeed are also found in a very similar form in the other existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot propose any tax relief, at least not at this stage, because it is not up to us to decide this. The Member States would have to do so. At this point we want to wait and see what the effects are of these experiences. Tax relief is always a very convenient way of creating incentives. Here we have a whole range of options that are at least equally effective. Access to the centralised procedure, in particular reduction of the fees – and here I agree with Mrs Heinisch – is of crucial importance to small and medium‐sized enterprises, who often complain of these fees. The fees can be waived in part or in whole. The Agency in London can also be of assistance in developing a protocol for trials and we believe this can certainly lead to useful support.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that some Members also spoke in favour of a special committee, during the debate. We believe that this is such a specialised problem that we need this kind of committee and cannot and should not use the committees normally available.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed two kinds of criteria. Of course you can always try to formulate others. But then you must remember the aim of our proposal. We want to support research. We want to make it more attractive, which is why we believe that the right criteria are epidemiological criteria, because they are objective and in particular because they can easily be applied at an early stage of product development.</p>
<p class="contents">There are problems with economic criteria. Forecasts and projections can hardly be made before the expiry of the ten‐year period. Of course we would have to call for considerable transparency on the part of the undertakings, which they are not always prepared to agree to, in order to be able to make these forecasts and projections.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, we are at first reading. Let me begin by telling you which amendments we can accept. There is a whole series of them: Nos 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 29, 32, 38 and 9 in part. Then I want to make a few comments on the amendments we cannot accept, beginning with No 6, which sets out an additional economic criterion. I already said that it is not very attractive, it makes the whole trial procedure more difficult and after all we have learned from the American experience. The USA had a similar criterion, which did not prove successful. It did not work. That is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult. That is why we do not want to accept that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now look at the second group, concerning diagnosis, namely Amendments Nos 33, 34, 35, 41 and 42. They all aim to exclude medicines for diagnostic purposes where no procedure exists for the treatment or prevention of the disease to be diagnosed. That could mean that we were preventing access to diagnosis, with the result that no appropriate treatment could be developed. We believe that is a risk we should not necessarily take on.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to the question of the fund, which has also been raised during the debate. It concerns Amendment No 18. In our view, the idea of a special fund that could be set up from the proceeds from the sale of orphan drugs following the expiry of the ten‐year period of market exclusivity could reduce the potential interest of undertakings, which would mean that we would still not have enough resources available in the fund, because the proceeds would not be enormous. For by definition an orphan drug is precisely a drug that offers very limited prospects of making a profit.</p>
<p class="contents">I will turn now to the measures for tropical diseases, which have also been mentioned. Of course we support the view that specific measures to support research in developing countries are useful. But we do not take the view that including a corresponding reference to this in a recital can produce that result. It would mean that, as unfortunately happens so often when we submit a detailed proposal, its scope is broadened because people want to take the opportunity to include a whole lot of other problems. But that is not a very logical way to make legislation. That is why we hope we can come back to this question of tropical diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest we can say that research into and consideration of tropical diseases is traditionally in the very best hands in the European Union. It is not the case that we have not lived up to our obligations here to date. But if Parliament so wishes, we can of course take another look at the question of how we can further improve this specific area of research into pharmaceutical products.</p>

This asks for a pharmaceutical company to be given an additional or extended period of six months" protection on a patent if it develops an orphan medicinal product – in other words, a further six months" protection for another product already introduced or marketed.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> I did not go into this matter directly. As I already said, this is the first reading. That is why I did not want to go into all the amendments. That is more or less the same argument I put forward in regard to tax relief and against the fund in general. I have already spoken against the fund. If additional patent protection is to be introduced, for instance in the event of the development of treatments or of the returns flowing back into a special fund, we would virtually be precluding competition from generic drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, that is what always happens. Once a medicinal product has been developed, researched and authorised, the ten‐year market exclusivity, which can in addition become a patent protection period, applies in all cases and the result is that during that period of protection no generic drugs can come onto the market. But if this period were further extended, that would have adverse effects. For generic drugs at the end of a patent or other protection period are of course useful. They may have additional effects, but at any rate they tend to be a little cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we do not regard this amendment as useful, because it would preclude the supply of generic drugs once the protection period has expired. In our view that cannot be the purpose of the proposal.</p>
