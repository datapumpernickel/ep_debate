<p class="contents">Those of us who have followed the process of postal liberalisation will be aware of what a long drawn-out affair it has been. Right from the outset in the late 1980s, this Parliament was keen to ensure that any liberalisation process should not adversely affect working conditions and should guarantee a universal postal service to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Modern technology has radically changed the way people communicate with each other, but at the end of the day citizens still like to see, on a daily basis, the postmen and postwomen who deliver our mail.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the starting point has to be that our postal services are not just about economic bottom lines, but they are also a social service that needs to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">It is from this basic starting point that we must judge Directive 2008/6/EC, which will complete the internal market in postal services by 31 December this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this oral question from the Committee on Transport and Tourism is to remind the Commission forcibly of the safeguards put in place by Parliament in this directive in the areas of social protection and the delivery and financing of a universal service, and to remind the Member States that the obligation is on them to protect both of these areas and not, as they have done with railway liberalisation, just to ignore the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Therein lies the dilemma faced by this Parliament. Firstly, there is a suspicion that the Commission will not enforce these important aspects of Directive 2008/6/EC but will act with great zeal in enforcing the economic liberalisation side of the directive and, secondly, that Member States will move at a snail’s pace, will do nothing to protect postal workers and postal services and will fail to finance adequately the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, there are four clear questions requiring four clear, unambiguous answers from the Commission. Those questions are the ones contained in this oral question.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not require technical Commission-speak answers or even quotes from the various treaties, etc. My committee is well-versed in the treaties. We require guarantees that what was agreed in Directive 2008/6/EC will be implemented, including the safeguarding of postal workers in all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We require the guarantee of a universal service. We want to see the studies demanded in the directive on the cost of delivering that universal service or at least a date for their completion. We want the Commission to carry out a full impact assessment on the liberalisation of the postal market and on the effects that it will have across the sector, and not just in terms of the economic aspects of that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, one could ask why this oral question is being placed before Parliament at this time. Sadly, the answer lies in a suspicion – even a mistrust – that having got, after many years, full liberalisation of this sector, Member States will ignore the social and service provision articles that are contained in the directive and that the Commission will allow them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">That simply cannot be allowed to happen. We as a Parliament are not prepared to have the same debacle afflict postal services that has been prevalent in the railway sector. Member States must abide by all the provisions of Directive 2008/6/EC and the Commission must be vigilant in ensuring that they do.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure to do this would, in our opinion, be a dereliction of duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have often heard me state, including in this very Chamber, during my hearing on 13 January, the personal commitment that I have always made and will continue to make to the preservation and protection of public services and to the reconciliation of the internal market – for which I am one of the people responsible – with the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I will have the opportunity to repeat this when the Single Market Act is presented in October. It is within this context that we – that you – want to develop and forge ahead with this internal market. It is an opportunity for employment, since real importance is attached to its human and social dimension and, as far as I am concerned, to the protection of public services and services of general interest. That is why I welcome the question you are asking on behalf of your colleagues, Mr Simpson.</p>
<p class="contents">This very important project to reform postal services has been under way for more than just a few months. Work began on it a long time ago. The market will be fully opened up on 1 January 2011 in 16 Member States, which account for 95% of the EU’s postal volume. I repeat: this is a reform project that has been carefully thought out. It is a gradual reform that was announced in 1992 with the Green Paper. Moreover, this will to reform has been enshrined in no fewer than three directives, and validated by many successive democratic processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the third and most recent directive, which you know well, Mr Simpson, for many reasons, was adopted in 2008, with the support of the European Parliament and of a huge majority within the Council of Ministers. Twenty-five Member States voted for this reform, which has been carried out, therefore, in a fairly transparent way. It has not been carried out secretly, or randomly; it has been carried out because it meets a need, that of enabling this sector, which is very important in every respect – to quote some figures, it generates EUR 95 billion in turnover, and directly or indirectly affects 5 million employees – to evolve, to innovate, to move with the times and to better meet the expectations of users – of citizens and businesses alike. The completion of this internal market, provided it is structured and supported, is in my view a guarantee of innovation, of adaptation to change, and, therefore, of economic growth and of better services that are designed to meet citizens’ needs more fully.</p>
<p class="contents">Operators face obvious challenges due to our evolving social and economic practices, but we in the Union are fortunate in that we have long been preparing for the development of this postal sector by undertaking what is, I believe, a consistent, considered and gradual reform. This sector is developing fast. New technologies are radically changing the ways in which we communicate. The electronic substitution phenomenon is gaining ground and is quite simply the result of new behaviour patterns on the part of Europeans themselves. In addition to that, there are the effects of the various economic and financial crises we are experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, quite frankly, who could actually think that a sudden, abrupt postponement of this process that we have carefully overseen is a desirable solution? Not the Commission, for at least three reasons. Firstly, achieving the 1992 Green Paper objectives is one important way for the European Union to come out of the crisis affecting the sector: we need efficient operators that rank among the best in the world, high-quality postal services and a sound, effective regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with these directives we have established a robust regulatory framework that relies on the involvement of competent national regulatory authorities, which are going to work together regularly and in a much more productive way. Liberalisation is taking place, therefore, in a controlled manner. In particular, these national regulators will have the task of ensuring, Mr Simpson, that the universal service obligations, to which I am very committed, are actually fulfilled properly and funded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, any hesitation at this very advanced stage of the reform would create widespread legal uncertainty, which would benefit no one. It would harm not only newcomers to these postal markets, but all other operators in the sector, too. Suspending this process would, in our view, plunge the sector into a situation where it has to simply wait and see what happens, without being able to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand all the concerns expressed on the subject of employment and working conditions. I know how important the postal service is in the context of European employment, ladies and gentlemen. May I remind you that the third directive, which offers the Member States considerable scope to reconcile liberalisation and social requirements, states that – and this is my only reference to the text, Mr Simpson – social considerations must be duly taken into account in the preparations for liberalising the postal markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, Mr Simpson, that we have a duty to ensure that all these requirements and all these conditions are fully met. In 2013, when all the EU Member States have implemented this reform, the Commission will present an official evaluation report to Parliament and to the Council. Other studies will be published before then. Moreover, in order to show how important your concerns are to me personally as Commissioner, and to President Barroso, I wish to inform you that, although I am under no obligation to do so, I intend to create a users’ dialogue group in 2011. The group of regulators is being established. In addition to and alongside that group I want to create a users’ group, so that businesses, citizen-users, trade unions, which have a very important role to play, and then Parliament, of course, can come around the same table and discuss what is happening on the ground, hear the report by the evaluators’ committee and regularly – just how regularly is still to be decided – carry out evaluations and hold dialogues in order to check that these various postal sector reforms are being implemented correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the guarantee I am giving you, and I shall personally ensure, Mr Simpson, ladies and gentlemen, that this users’ dialogue group functions properly and transparently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have managed to significantly improve the quality of postal services throughout Europe. I can still remember that, two parliamentary terms ago, I said in this Chamber that it was usual for holidaymakers to arrive home before the postcards they had sent home to their loved ones. That situation has now changed. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of cross-border postal services. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of postal services within the Member States. With the obligation for a universal service that is uniform throughout Europe, we have also managed to significantly improve the availability of postal services, or in areas where it was already good, we were able to maintain this level. That is also important, and it was mentioned by both the Commissioner and our committee chair.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in implementing the third directive, which for the majority of Member States specifies 1 January 2011 as the date for complete liberalisation, it is now important to safeguard this universal service on a permanent basis. I would like to emphasise what is stated in the question regarding the simultaneous requirement – and that was the <span class="italic">Conditio sine qua non</span> for the third directive – that it should not result in a deterioration in working conditions, but that existing social standards and protection mechanisms should continue to apply in the Member States beyond 1 January 2011. We will, of course, ensure that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not only have the oral question today, but the Commission also has obligations to provide us with reports. We will read these reports very carefully, Commissioner, and if necessary we will also formulate the appropriate conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, thank you for your answer and for seeking to establish a dialogue among users. However, our group thinks that more is needed. As I am sure you know, we have always been critical of the Postal Directive. Improving the efficiency and dynamism of the sector would seem a laudable objective, but there are two essential elements that are not, to my mind, sufficiently developed or sufficiently guaranteed. These are the social aspect – working conditions – and the financing of universal service, which must be continued, at least according to the Directive. These two aspects are closely related.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the social aspect, we note that the ball has been placed in the Member States’ court but that hardly any use is being made of the opportunities for creating a level playing field between former monopolies and new players in this sphere. That is a big mistake, as competition is not taking place on the basis of innovation and innovative concepts but rather on the basis of cost cutting in the sector, where labour costs account for approximately 70% of production costs. In practice, we are seeing postmen and postwomen being replaced by people who have precarious contracts, lower wages and less security. That is not the Europe we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Universal service – the obligation to guarantee a home delivery every working day, including in sparsely populated areas – has up to now been financed by the monopoly. In other words, large customers have been contributing towards the service to ordinary citizens. In practice, this will now have to be replaced by State aid, and what is more in a very difficult budgetary context in the next few years, and there is reason to fear this coming under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Commissioner, I should like to ask you the following questions. Do you agree with me that one of the most important objectives of the Directive, namely bringing about greater social and territorial cohesion, will be hard to achieve in this context? Secondly, you refer to a 2013 report, but could you not undertake in the shorter term a detailed analysis of Member States’ transposition of the Directive, addressing in particular the two aspects I cited: the social aspect and universal service? Finally, in addition, how does the Commission intend to strengthen the social dialogue in the sector at European level and take initiatives to arrive at a level playing field in the social sphere for all the workers in the sector? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know very well, we are experiencing demographic change in Europe. In future, there will be fewer people living in many areas than there are now. Nevertheless, we want all citizens to be provided with the services that they require and that they need in order to be able to have their say. This includes – very importantly – the postal service, which is to be guaranteed by means of a universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the question of how we can ensure the provision of the service in remote rural areas with little money in the coffer, and at affordable prices. We also need people to deliver this post who are paid a reasonable wage for doing so. That is not a simple task for the Member States. However, we have decided that that is what we want and you, Commissioner, have indicated that a large majority of the Member States have also agreed to it. We now also need to make it possible for users to complain. I can see a problem with this. It has not yet been mentioned. However, the directive states that if something goes wrong, citizens should have a body they can complain to. It is not so easy, either, to maintain the appropriate infrastructure in this regard, particularly where there are not many people.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier, you said that you are still new to this office and that you will at least take everything into account. I believe you. However, you have to understand that we are extremely sceptical, particularly in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Mr Simpson said that the same thing happened in the case of the railway package – the previous Commission was responsible for monitoring its implementation – practically nothing was implemented and nothing happened. In other areas, too, things have not always proceeded in the way we would have liked them to. I know that, because I was also previously in politics in Germany. Decisions are made which are extremely good and which everyone is agreed on, and then no one thinks to check to see whether it is implemented and whether it is implemented quickly in the interests of the people of Europe and in the interests of workers. That is what we want from you. Therefore, show us that we can trust you. We will be very pleased if that turns out to be justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor do I dispute the fact that it is important to monitor their application. However, I do think that it is just as democratic and transparent to actually evaluate, at some point, the effects of a directive and the effects of its application. I do think there are probably slight differences between the Member States, but I do not believe we can talk about improving the postal service or making it more accessible to European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about a reasoned and supportive attitude. I think it is reasonable to state that we are witnessing a concentration of private operators and hence a kind of private oligopoly rather than the dismantling of a public monopoly and the introduction of competition, as had been planned. I am not sure this was the intended outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">You talked about supporting a process. What regulatory practices are being applied? I am pleased that there is a group of regulators, but I would like to have a clear understanding of what constitutes good regulatory practice, since there are many flaws in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of European employment, I would join my fellow Member, Mr El Khadraoui, in stressing that the new jobs that are being created are very much insecure jobs, and that job losses are, instead, the rule.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that you are setting up a round table so that all the parties involved can engage in dialogue. If we want, as you do, to reconcile the internal market with the citizens, then opening up the postal service is really a textbook exercise in order to demonstrate that this is possible. However, this requires, firstly, a case-by-case evaluation of the results and the effects seen on the ground today. These are not the objectives that you set – or that others set. It is about time we evaluated the situation before we forge ahead and actually create an even bigger gap between European citizens and their postal services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Barnier, as you mentioned a moment ago, you stated when you assumed office that you would give the internal market a more social dimension. In his report, Professor Monti also put strong emphasis on this, and that is to be welcomed. What is the situation in reality, though? Yesterday, during the demonstration by hundreds of postmen and postwomen outside this building, a Dutch postwoman told me that she was already 55 years old, had been working for the postal service for only 20 years and was therefore assuming that she would be one of the first to be laid off by TNT Post next year. She is not alone. TNT Post in the Netherlands is laying off all its postmen and postwomen, purely and simply because it is now having to contend with competitors – from its own subsidiary, mark you – employing temporary ‘flexible’ workers to deliver the post for much lower pay. We are talking about 15 000 redundancies of professional postmen and postwomen who are reliable and can be trusted with our post and who, in many cases, have been doing the job for decades. Commissioner, why have you never had a study carried out into the social impact of the liberalisation of the postal market; or, rather, why are you keeping from the European Parliament the study that you have already financed, which can be found on the Internet at pique.at? The liberalisation will have dramatic consequences for everyone sending or receiving post. In the Netherlands, we are seeing several companies delivering post a couple of times a day or in the middle of the night and on other days not at all, the closure of post offices, more or less all of them, and the latest idea to be developed within your services, among that group of regulators that you mentioned but did not consult Parliament on, namely to introduce extra-high tariffs for people living on islands or in mountainous regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, can you send us a full study of all the consequences of the liberalisation for postmen and postwomen and for the service as such at long last, and can you present a proposal without delay to postpone the date for commencement of the liberalisation – a moratorium, that is – until we are in possession of these data? That would give the internal market a social dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a sovereign nation, our post offices were run by the Royal Mail and linked with national savings, licensing, welfare and pension collection, to name a few.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1975, we had 25 000 post offices. Now there are fewer than 12 000 despite a population boom. After being forced to sell off their profit-making arm, post offices could not stay open without government support. Thousands shut, stripping communities of access to vital services.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU postal reform says that good quality postal services should be available throughout the Union. That is exactly what we had in Britain. As a consolidated enterprise, the service was efficient, prices were managed and everyone had access to it. Now the sector has been broken up, along with people’s faith in it. It is a disgrace to strip Britain of an efficient public service merely to satisfy competition law. Do you wish to privatise our NHS as well next? The UK must be allowed to fully opt out of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This liberalisation process is yet to show that it can fulfil the objectives of better availability and better quality at affordable prices. In the past, traditional postal undertakings also provided good quality at good prices. However, we also have to recognise the fact that traditional postal service providers have undergone modernisation, which, through major restructuring, has enabled them to increase their efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is extremely important for various points to be taken into account. It is vital, for example, that labour law continues to be respected, in other words working conditions and wages. This can only be controlled by means of collective agreements. That is the only way to prevent social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">The universal service has been mentioned many times already: the delivery of letters and packages throughout the whole of Europe. I also expect the Commission to carry out a study on the universal service. Furthermore, every country must fulfil its obligation to set up an independent regulatory authority. In addition to the regulatory requirements, this authority must also monitor the working conditions of the staff and deal with customer complaints. In order to make this possible, such an authority must be provided with the necessary staff.</p>
<p class="contents">As electronic mail and purchasing and selling via the Internet are becoming more and more widespread and banks, insurance and advertising are all making use of the postal infrastructure, this must be strengthened in the short term. I expect the Commission to provide an impact assessment that also takes account of social aspects. I also congratulate the Commission on the establishment of the users’ dialogue group for trade unions, clients and operators, which was announced by Mr Barnier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, it is vital in the postal services sector that Member States ensure the collection, sorting, transport and delivery of mail to all European citizens, regardless of where they live, once a day, at least five days a week, at the same price across the whole Member State, in keeping with the obligation to provide a universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight the need, even during this crisis period, for Member States to continue to keep postal networks operating efficiently, with a sufficient number of access points, including in rural and sparsely populated areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the completion of the internal market of Community postal services stipulates the obligation for Member States to define their own methods for funding the universal service, providing them with sufficient flexibility. This funding determines the quality of the postal service, the provision of decent working conditions for postal service workers and guarantees concerning jobs and employees’ training and incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is absolutely essential for the Commission to present to us by the end of this year a study on the impact of postal services liberalisation in states which have completely opened up to competition in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to point out the need for postal operators to diversify their activities through providing services appropriate for the information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many people living in rural areas – many of whom I represent – and many employed in the services in Ireland and in Europe have real, genuine concerns. Postmen and postwomen play a vital role in Irish life. I should like to take this opportunity to thank them and pay tribute to them for the role they play, often going beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p class="contents">The postal service, as we all know, is more than an economic sector. It is an integral part of our social fabric in rural areas, particularly in my own country, as 40% of our population live in those rural areas. Postal workers are a great source of social contact for many elderly people and those living in isolated communities. It is therefore vitally important that the Commission ensures that the universal service obligation contained in this legislation is fully respected. I take note of the comment by the Commissioner in relation to the obligation of national regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must guarantee that mail will be collected from and delivered to customers everywhere throughout the Union, including the most rural areas, five days a week in accordance with the legislation. I am pleased to hear the comment from the Commissioner on the users’ dialogue group which of course will involve the citizens, businesses, the unions and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a visit here from a delegation of European postal workers some time ago. I believe that we have an obligation to represent them and, more importantly, to represent the citizens and ensure that they have the universal service which they had many years ago, long before the economic developments in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, the feedback that we MEPs receive indicates a worsening of the situation. We are already seeing a thinning-out of the postal services in rural areas. Access to postal services in rural areas is no longer guaranteed, particularly in areas of human settlement that are difficult to get to.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have additional jobs, they are not full-time jobs. It is not possible to earn a living wage from them, and they can at best merely constitute an additional income for a family. However, if the only user of postal services we consider is the advertising industry then, of course, success has already been recorded, because there is no doubt that this industry has improved its business foundation. The universal service that is in fact intended to guarantee a basic service, is now to be paid for by the Member States, which on the other hand are under enormous pressure because there is no more budgetary leeway to be able to guarantee the provision of this service in rural areas by means of subsidies. Commissioner, in this case the indirect consequences in this area have been given far too little consideration in the impact assessment and this will lead to a deterioration of the situation for consumers and for postal service workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My question to you, Commissioner Barnier, is when will this study be made available to Parliament at long last?</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we heard from numerous postal workers from several EU Member States that entire workforces are already being dismissed by the new postal companies and re-employed under poorer conditions. Competition and competition policy must not be played out at the expense of the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission and Parliament really want to do something to combat poverty and exclusion in the EU, the third phase of the postal service liberalisation must now be discontinued.

The directive on the completion of the internal market in postal services is such a decision. We must make every effort for the directive to be implemented correctly and in time in all Member States. Mr Barnier’s answer shows clearly that he is going to work on this in close cooperation with the Member States. I very much welcome the Commission’s decision to appoint a European Regulators Group for Postal Services, which will be composed of the national regulatory authorities in the field. I am sure this will help consolidate postal services. Opening the postal markets of Member States to independent operators is another extremely important topic, and I note with optimism all the Commission’s specific measures, about which we have also heard, here. These measures are intended to enable independent operators to operate freely in each Member State. I am very pleased with the plans concerning permanent monitoring of implementation of the directive. There is one other matter: a European identity requires distinct symbols. These symbols are the common currency, flag and anthem, but, similarly, another symbol of European identity would be zero-rated roaming in the European Union and a common postage stamp. Would it not be worthwhile to consider such measures? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For example, in a large but sparsely populated country like Finland, there is a danger that competition will only be of interest in the most densely populated urban areas, where they can derive an economic benefit. On the other hand, the costs of delivering the mail in the unprofitable sparsely populated areas will have to be met by society.</p>
<p class="contents">Delivery costs in sparsely populated areas are on average four times higher than in built­up areas. In extreme cases the difference might be anything up to 10 times more. Even so, in Finland too some postal services have now been opened up to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive attempts to safeguard the standard of services by means of obligations imposed on the holder of a universal service obligation. I would like to hear the Commissioner’s view regarding how competition can be genuine and on an equal footing if the demands concerning the quality and standard of service placed on the holder of the USO are significantly more stringent than those placed on the competition. How are the costs incurred in the provision of the universal service to be met?</p>
<p class="contents">The directive proposes funding options, of which the simplest is to finance losses out of taxes. This, however, will probably not be seen as a sensible move, given the current state of public finances. The situation in Finland threatens to become nothing less than absurd. The holder of the USO there is a profitable state­owned company, whose annual profits of roughly EUR 100 million would be converted into state budgetary expenditure representing more or less the same amount, so that a few companies would be able to make a profit from the lucrative markets in the cities and towns. This could be very difficult to explain away to the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether it will be possible within the framework of this directive to legislate nationally on, for example, the charge on delivering a postal service, payable by all operators in the sector in order to guarantee services impartially and in unprofitable areas too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They play an important role in competitiveness and in the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion. Therefore, it is not acceptable that those who live in rural areas should not have access to services of the same quality that other people have. The most disadvantaged or isolated populations have the right to quality postal services. There has been a decrease in service access points in rural areas, and a decrease in the quality of service in Portugal and in other Member States. The quality of these services must be improved or maintained, but it should never diminish.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also prevent the application of European legislation from leading to negative impacts on the working conditions and salaries of postal workers. We cannot accept that those competing for service providers intend to eat only meat, leaving just the bones for everyone else. By way of explanation, I refer, for example, to those who only intend to provide services in locations where distribution is profitable, meaning in areas with larger population density.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary for the Commission to find solutions to prevent the problems I have just mentioned, further striving to ensure that the legislation regarding this matter be complied with and, if necessary, improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From this point of view, the opening-up of the postal market represents a real challenge for this sector, at a time when technological developments and the economic crisis have weakened those companies that have historically transported postal items.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many of my fellow Members, I am very attached to economic and social cohesion, and to territorial cohesion, of which these postal services ultimately form part. As Vice-Chair of the postal services intergroup, I am conscious of the fears that exist with regard to the future of services of general economic interest: indeed, around 100 postal workers demonstrated yesterday in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is crucial to ensure that the postal market is not opened up at the expense of working conditions and quality of service. The aim of the 2008 directive is to guarantee a quality service at competitive prices and to create jobs. To achieve this aim, the law must be scrupulously applied, in particular with regard to universal service obligations. Furthermore, postal service providers must evolve by diversifying their activities and, at the same time, their sources of income.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are counting on the European Commission to be vigilant and to closely monitor developments in this economic sector.

Europe has been innovating in this sector since 1992, with the most recent directive being in 2008. I consider it a very important step in view of the powerful monopolistic organisation of the national postal markets in most Member States, which results in ever-rising prices for postal services and a negative impact on consumers in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the liberalisation and privatisation of the European postal market and the breaking up of state monopolies, which will lead not only to lower prices, but also to better quality postal services for the ordinary consumer, and what I hope will be the least possible impact on employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I urge the Commission once again to analyse not only the electricity market, as it did at the start of 2010, but also postal services, in order to determine the extent to which consumers really benefit from a free market in terms of choice, price and quality. I would also urge it to analyse job quality within postal services. I ask this because the time for making fine statements about the benefits of liberalisation has passed. It is time, now, to make judgments on the basis of actual evidence before any further steps are taken, so that the mistakes made in the other liberalised sectors are not repeated in the postal services sector.</p>

<p class="contents">I have heard the Commissioner’s response and, in some respects, I am gratified at what I have heard, but there is deep concern in this Parliament that, with the liberalisation of the postal services, social conditions and workers’ conditions, as well as the service conditions that are contained in the universal service, will be diluted on the altar of liberalisation and privatisation on some issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it is relevant that we make that point to him and I hope he will come back on that in his response.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to raise is in response to the spokesman from the EFD Group with regard to the United Kingdom and the fact that he was blaming the closure of sub-post offices in the United Kingdom on this liberalisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to nail that lie very strongly. The closure of sub-post offices in the United Kingdom was a decision of the United Kingdom. It was a decision that came about because the UK Government reduced its subsidy to sub-post offices and it changed its payments of benefits into a direct payments method. That was one of the major reasons why, along with Royal Mail cutbacks, sub-post offices closed in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the idea of a UK opt-out is one of the most hilarious things I have ever heard in my life as far as postal services are concerned. Why? The most Hezbollah, pro-liberal, ‘let’s get on with it quicker than any other government’ government in Europe on liberalisation was the United Kingdom’s own government, from Thatcher to Major to Blair...</p>

<p class="contents">I wish to make two or three points before responding in slightly more depth.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as I said earlier and as everyone ought objectively to recognise, this reform, this controlled liberalisation of postal services, has not been carried out in a secretive, hurried or random fashion; it has been carried out in accordance with legitimate democratic processes and with the support of all the governments. Many of you have played a very important part in this: Mr Simpson, you are one of those people, Mr Ferber is another, and I could mention many other names besides.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where we are today. This is a gradual reform. As my services pointed out to me, there have been around 20 sectoral studies. Mr de Jong, there has been no hastiness or secretiveness. Mr Tarabella, there has been no rushing ahead regardless, either. Things are being done gradually and in stages. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I know what is written in the Treaties and in the texts. Mrs Auconie mentioned a very important term: territorial cohesion. I fought as one of the authors of the old constitution and of the new Treaty of Lisbon – at that time I was European Commissioner for Institutional Reform – to have the words ‘territorial cohesion’ included in the treaty. It was not easy. These are words that mean something, just as, in the Treaty of Lisbon, there are new words on security and the protection of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">These are words to which I attach importance, over and above my personal beliefs, which I would like to outline in one sentence: I do not believe that Europe can be summed up as a large free trade area. Europe is not just the internal market. It is a common area of economic, social and human life. Indeed, I returned to the European Commission with that firm belief. It will underpin the work that I do throughout the five years in which I have the honour of being in this role. That is what is in the treaty. I have not forgotten it, and, if need be, I will remind all those who have forgotten it.</p>
<p class="contents">And then there are the texts of these directives, ladies and gentlemen. Frankly, I do not believe – I have said this to Mrs Wils and to others – that a moratorium or a sudden suspension of this process would help matters. From my point of view, it would create uncertainty, which would harm businesses and users, and, all things considered, it would be irresponsible. Yet, having said that, having thus confirmed that the process will get under way, we have a duty to check that it gets under way properly and in accordance with what is written in the texts of the directives and in the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bach and Mrs Auconie mentioned the universal postal service; there are some important words in the texts that are designed to strengthen the provision of the universal service. There are many mechanisms that safeguard this service provision, and we must verify that they are used; this applies to the compensation fund, to designations in the field of public contracts and to other instruments besides. These are words that I have not forgotten, either.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of working conditions is also laid down as an essential requirement that must be taken into account when authorising or approving postal operators. As regards social protection – Mr de Jong, Mrs Durant and Mrs Serracchiani raised this issue – it is clearly stated in the third Postal Directive that the Member States have access to instruments in labour law to prevent any possible social dumping, and it is the responsibility of those Member States to respect the principle of subsidiarity and find the best way of guaranteeing this correct level of employment and social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I could cite countless other examples of phrases and words that are all requirements for the Member States, for businesses and for the Commission, under the supervision of your Parliament and of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word about an issue that affects me personally, because for 20 years I was the elected representative of a rural, and indeed very mountainous, region, and we know how important public services are for the most isolated and the weakest people who live in such regions. Mr Gallagher raised this issue, as did Mr Fernandes, Mrs Auconie and Mrs Harkin just now. On the subject of rural areas, I would point out that, where the Member States fail to meet certain minimum requirements, the Commission will use all the instruments at its disposal to ensure that they provide these basic postal services, particularly in rural areas, in pursuance of this territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that we need to make progress, without rushing ahead regardless, but we do have to make sure that the provisions in the texts, in the treaty, are respected. That is why, Mr President, the evaluation, study, report and, where necessary, correction, stages must be put to good use. Mr El Khadraoui, Mrs Ticău and Mrs Wils mentioned the first studies. I can confirm that we are going to undertake a first study this year – at the end of this year, Mr El Khadraoui – which will provide all the parties involved with an analysis of the recent developments in the postal markets and which will also cover the most recent employment trends.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not stop there: there is the official report that we are due to present to Parliament and to the Council in 2013, when the entire directive will be implemented by all the Member States. Then, there is this users’ dialogue group, in which you will participate, along with trade unions, businesses and users themselves. The group will hear the group of regulators and examine the impact assessments provided by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude – and here I am addressing Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein, Mrs Durant and others – I am as committed as you are to ensuring that these directives are implemented correctly, without citizens and users being penalised. I will be as committed as you are to ensuring that the impact assessments are objective, accurate and honest. Moreover, since I am talking about sincerity, I shall repeat what Mr Simpson said: ‘We have to be fair with Europe.’ That is why these studies and the publicity that we will generate in their regard, the debates that we will create around these studies – especially within this users’ dialogue group – are important. I shall undertake to ensure that we are fair with the European Union and with the decisions that we have taken together.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about jobs in the postal services, when we talk about the quality of distribution, when we talk about territorial cohesion, when we talk about social protection, what impact do European decisions have? What impact do the decisions taken by businesses have? What impact do the policy decisions of governments have? We must say who is responsible for what and not hold the European Union responsible for everything that happens on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also why I want to see this debate and evaluation work through to the end, and it is why, Mrs Durant, ladies and gentlemen, I personally will oversee the creation of the users’ dialogue group. I will do so in order to demonstrate the Commission’s sincerity and sense of purpose in this sphere, which is at the heart of this internal market, as an area of common economic and social life, to which I am committed and for which I am one of the people responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However much this Directive will create additional competition in towns and cities, there is no doubt that it will seriously degrade the service provided in rural areas. 40% of the people of Ireland are rural dwellers and it is essential that a postal service is provided for those of them living in remote areas. Postal services in such areas are often unprofitable.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission ensure that essential services for small, remote communities are not discontinued and that mail will continue to be collected and delivered in remote areas, in accordance with the universal service obligation? Given that business to business deliveries and postal services in towns and cities are the most profitable, what can be done to ensure that new bodies do not neglect customers and services in remote or non-profitable areas? This Directive could have a significant social impact on certain communities and postal workers. These issues must be addressed before the Directive is implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is the world’s leading region, which has now been acting according to defined principles for over 50 years. We are strong, because we have been united and we have shown solidarity. The larger Member States of the Union have respected the interests of the smaller states, and the economically more powerful states have supported the economically weaker states. Nor must we resile from these principles going forward. France’s intention to sell Mistral warships to the Russian Federation, which two years ago attacked Georgia, a partner state of the European State and of NATO, has aroused indignation among the population of several Member States. I do not wish to question France’s right to do such a deal. Nevertheless, I call upon France to abide by those EU and NATO principles that it has observed in the past, and, I am convinced, will also observe in the future. This deal is causing concern to France’s NATO and EU partners, which have always observed the principles of mutual solidarity. In the short term, this deal may well be financially advantageous, but in the long term it could reduce European security and worsen relations between Member States, thereby making us weaker. A partner’s point of view must not be ignored, especially on so important a question as the military security of EU Member States. We must not allow other countries to weaken our unity with deals of this sort. Let us not forget that our closest friends and allies are not to be found in the East, but within the Union. Let us continue to abide by the principles by which we have abided to date. If we remain united, we shall remain strong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I draw attention to this situation because we have been given, in this way, the ability to refine certain solutions and mechanisms which are in use in the other Member States. It should be pointed out that letters up to 50 grams in weight – and a great many such letters are sent by post – will be completely deregulated, although they are often letters of an official or judicial nature, which are sent as part of responsibilities entrusted to the state. The question arises, therefore, as to how the Commission intends to prevail upon Member States so that as part of the liberalisation they make it possible for services which are so important to be offered by different operators while at the same time maintaining stability and security for the state and its citizens. Considerable fears are also aroused by the very mention of the matter of adequate social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Enterprises which operate postal services are usually huge firms with considerable human resources. Will, therefore, an aggressive pricing policy and the cost-cutting policy that will go with it not result in a definite reduction in staff numbers? Meanwhile, from the point of view just of the quality of the services, the question arises as to whether the price factor will not bring about a reduction in standards. The way postal services are operated also depends on the places where mail can be sent and collected, how many there are of these facilities and their accessibility. In the case of large metropolitan areas, I am not worried. However, small towns, and rural areas in particular, may be almost completely deprived of access to postal services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition must not be played out at the expense of workers, in other words on the basis of pay and working conditions. We must retain high quality jobs in the European postal service, because that is the only way that we will be able to guarantee the universal service for everyone. Postal services must be equally accessible to everyone, wherever they live – it must be a basic right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission’s job to protect the citizens of the European Union from social dumping and to maintain labour standards. So far, however, nothing has been done. The opening up of European markets must not go hand in hand with the abolition of social protection rights. We reject the competition between the social systems of the Member States. I call for a moratorium until the social impact has been investigated, social conditions are secure throughout the postal market, the financing of the universal services is ensured and a way is found for competition to be based on quality and innovation in the market. Member States must provide legislative guarantees of the full accessibility of postal services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
