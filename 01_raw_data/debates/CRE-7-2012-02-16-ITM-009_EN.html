While what the scheme hopes to achieve is clearly desirable for all Member States, it is my view that the measures which have been proposed to reach these aims are neither suitable nor workable in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Group, we do not consider it wise to demand that all Member States impose such a high level of pre-funding, especially when our banks are trying to increase capital levels while minimising the withdrawal of credit to consumers. We believe that, rather than imposing a blanket scheme for all Member States, it will be preferable for guarantee schemes and pre-funding levels to be tailored to the needs of the individual Member States, according to their own circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the one-size-fits-all proposals that the rapporteur puts forward are actually geared much more towards the banking system of his own country, Germany, than they are towards the EU as a whole. It is this factor, coupled with the insistence on a high level of pre-funding – to be built up over a short period – which led us as a Group, the ECR, to oppose this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sums are off the scale. In the United Kingdom, we spent GBP 1 trillion. We know where the money came from. We do not know where it is now; we do not know who has got it. What happened in the panicky days in the intermediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehmans was a total loss of nerve. In their turmoil, politicians the world over turned for advice to the one lot of people who could not give them disinterested counsel, namely bankers. Of course bankers suggested that the banks be bailed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you know what, if we had asked the bakers whether we should bail out the bakeries, I suspect we would have got the same answer, and the bakers might have almost believed it – saying foodstuffs are an absolutely essential commodity, they are not like anything else, and so forth. But that is why we do not ask them; that is why we have representative government.</p>
<p class="contents">There has now been this explosion of anger, which has taken the form of the occupying movements. I would just say to anyone protesting in those movements: the one thing you are not complaining about is capitalism. In a capitalist system, bad banks would have been allowed to fail; their profitable operations would have been bought by more successful competitors, shareholders and bondholders would have lost, and taxpayers would not have contributed a penny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The single most frequent question I am asked by my constituents is: Why is the EP not taking seriously the issue of austerity in the way that Member States are having to? The joke is, of course, that some of the Members here think they are. They need to go and have a look at what is happening in places like Greece and see exactly what needs to be done. We need to take a very big slash to our budgets. This place is not an alternative source of funding for pet projects in Member States that are not funded by Member State governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty states: the seat of the European Parliament is in Strasbourg. We could implement all the savings ourselves without having to consult with the Council. We could abolish the mini-part-sessions in Brussels, leading to substantial savings. We could move our administration from Brussels to here, leading to more substantial savings. We could sell our expensive buildings in Brussels and invest much more economically here, leading to yet more substantial savings.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, however, that no one who supported Amendment 2 wants to do that. This shows that the issue at stake here is not cost cutting.

<p class="contents">In my opinion, however, the European Parliament has become an arena for the internal battles being fought out in Hungary between left and right. I do not wish to judge – for that is not my role – whether Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is right in everything he does. He probably is not, for he is no saint, but our Parliament should certainly not be engaged in the internal political games being played out in individual countries. Such games are always going on, and individual democracies obviously have a right to them, but the role of the European Parliament should not be devalued by using it in such disputes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should not happen. If this happened today with Hungary, then we can ask ourselves when it will happen to other countries. Why is this happening? It is because the right-wing conservative government of Prime Minister Orbán decided to introduce into the constitution a reference to the values that are contrary to the political correctness in force in Europe today: a reference to Christian values, a reference to the institution of matrimony as a union between a woman and a man, and a reference to the principle that human life is protected from the moment of conception.</p>
<p class="contents">The double standards and hypocrisy of the Socialists who are attacking Hungary today is shown by the fact that when I sent a letter on behalf of a group of Members of Parliament and voters from Poland to President Schulz, then President of the Socialist Group, and now President of the European Parliament, referring to the mass ejection from the Polish media of right-wing journalists with right-wing views, there was no response.

See-through ballot boxes and cameras in polling stations do not address systematic problems. President Medvedev himself has recognised that the rules need to be changed, but after the Presidential elections. This time, candidates throughout the country each had to collect 2 million signatures within a very short period – over four weeks (two of which were over Christmas). Such requirements constitute a formal basis for restricting voters’ opportunities to choose candidates from a broad political spectrum. Observer status is only granted to representatives of registered candidates and this limits the opportunities for public observation and monitoring of elections. There are worrying reports of barriers faced by several non-governmental organisations, above all, the <span class="italic">Golos</span> association.</p>

Russia is an important partner for the European Union. It borders the continent of Europe. It is also Poland’s neighbour. It is hardly surprising that more and more people in this House, regardless of political divisions, view with growing concern what is happening on our eastern border.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt about the fact that the upcoming presidential election in Russia will not be a fair election. In fact, measures against the opposition are intensifying. It is not a simple matter for candidates who do not fall in with the authorities to get registered. Added to this is Russia’s position in international politics, which has de-masked the Putin regime somewhat. I have in mind here Russia’s veto of the UN resolution on Syria. The Russian stance on this question shows what they really are – supporters of the ruthless murderers of the Syrian regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a prelude to the mobilisations that will follow the re-election of Putin. It is increasingly a movement that is fed up and disgusted with the whole political elite and with the thieves, the oligarchs that have enriched themselves at the expense of Russian workers, Russian pensioners and Russian youth. The movement is a demonstration of massive people-power in action, but the current leadership – a combination of failed neoliberal politicians and right-wing nationalist demagogues – does not offer any way forward in the struggle for democratic rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, when corrupt politicians dominate the electoral arena, my sister party in Russia does not recognise the legitimacy of the presidential elections.

A smooth and impartial process of election monitoring is also important for the development of Russian society.

The governments of these countries have essentially placed human rights on the altar of trade relations with Moscow. It seems to me that it would be good if by speaking out loudly today – and rightly so – in defence of human rights in Russia, in defence of free elections and in defence of free media, the representatives of many groups in this Parliament were to beat their breasts over their own government, for example, the German Government, as well as others.

If such a system is to function, elections need to be fair and free. The other parliamentary elections in Russia reflected the distorted reality in which the country currently finds itself. They were neither wholly free, nor wholly fair. They may have shown that citizens are allowed to express their will in elections, but that will is ultimately not respected. The EU must consistently draw Russia's attention to these matters, and it must establish the consequences in terms of further development of relations. I therefore support the resolution we have adopted today and the provisions for the EU to put pressure on Russia to conduct a thorough investigation of all irregularities that accompanied these elections, in order to draw the consequences from this.

The resolution quite rightly stresses the importance of finding common ground at the forthcoming meeting of the UN Human Rights Council. Speaking with one voice has been the stumbling block to political cooperation on the part of the European Union, especially in foreign policy. Speaking with one voice would promote visibility and the power of influence of the EU as a global actor.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention what I believe to be important issues in today’s international situation. The mainstreaming of human rights must have a role in building a country’s institutions. In particular, the new democracies emerging from the Arab Spring must receive support while they are building a genuinely democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Syria is worrying and affects Europeans. It is extremely regrettable that a crisis that has already claimed 7 000 lives cannot be brought to an end. The UN needs to reach agreement on joint measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that the EU should ensure that the universality, inseparability and interdependence of human rights should not be called into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this is one of the ways in which we can extend the hitherto very restricted access of the visually impaired to publications. I therefore support a targeted exception to copyright, which should be part of an international treaty drawn up at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).

As the closure of several banks has fully demonstrated, the stability of deposit and credit systems is essential to the success of the European economy. Member States’ citizens had to be compensated practically from public funds because of the failure of banking institutions responsible for managing their deposits. In these circumstances, the establishment of a European deposit guarantee scheme contributes significantly to the effective and real time protection of the European citizens’ savings. A further concrete advantage of the proposal is the establishment of protection measures enabling the prevention of banking institution failures, warning the national and European authorities in real terms about the existing systemic risks. I support the adoption of this measure by the European Parliament, which complements the directive adopted previously by the Council and the European Parliament on the increase of the deposit ceiling guaranteed by public authorities and on reducing the time for compensating the depositors. At the same time, I believe that by adopting this proposal, a decisive step is made towards achieving a genuine single market in banking services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nothing justifies my commitment better than that the adoption of this report will enable us to prevent the kind of banking panic that caused great upheaval in Hungary recently, as many people had terminated their domestic deposits and placed their funds with the banks of other countries. It is especially welcome that the directive clearly determines the coverage level for the same depositor, and that the incomes resulting from all transactions under this protection are indicated specifically by name, and that the incomes of local governments are also given sufficient coverage. This common safety net offers a high level of protection to depositors in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It introduces concrete measures relating to common requirements for comprehensive protection of depositors and equal stability of DGSs within the EU; flexibility in terms of prevention and support measures that ensure stability; realistic time limits for payments, in the interests of depositors; and European DGSs and the promotion of European cooperation.

This proposal aims to modify and replace older directives with one introducing uniform standards for bank deposit guarantee and protection.

Existing national deposit guarantee schemes in the EU must reimburse depositors in the event of failure of a credit institution up to a certain ceiling. In truth, during the financial and economic crisis, the coverage level was increased to as much as EUR 100 000 per depositor and the time limit for paying depositors was reduced to a maximum of 30 working days. The increased level of protection improves depositors’ confidence and thus helps to prevent simultaneous withdrawals by many depositors prompted by a fear of losing their money. These steps to strengthen the confidence of depositors are very welcome but more can and must be done. That is precisely why we are considering laying down a binding requirement throughout the EU that deposit guarantee schemes in all EU Member States and all credit institutions should comply with common requirements. This would avoid any distortion of competition, protect depositors equally in all Member States and prevent destabilising displacements of deposits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the exacerbation of the global crisis, other banks have collapsed and their depositors have not always recovered their savings. This situation has caused the public to have a certain amount of mistrust in financial institutions, which needs to be won back. This report, drafted by Mr Simon, concerns the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, at first reading, on deposit guarantee schemes. I welcome this proposal for a directive intended to create a fund for guaranteeing deposits, since it cannot be the taxpayer that pays for the banks’ financial problems. On the contrary, the public should have guarantees that, if a bank fails, their deposits will not be under threat and they will be reimbursed within a reasonable timeframe. I voted for this report, since the new regulations will benefit the European public and society through guarantees and harmonisation, thereby contributing to the construction of a single market in financial services at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Banks are therefore exposed to the risk of a mass withdrawal of deposits if savers believe that their deposits are not safe. That can have a serious impact on the entire economy. At present, there are almost 40 deposit guarantee schemes in the EU protecting different groups of savers and deposits at different levels of cover, and imposing different financial obligations on banks, which limits the advantages of the single market both for banks and savers. With the aim of facilitating the start-up and operation of credit institutions, it is necessary to eliminate differences in Member State laws concerning the rules on deposit guarantee schemes that apply to these institutions. The directive in question is a fundamental instrument for the creation of a single market in the area of credit institution activities from the perspective of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide financial services, while increasing the stability of the banking system and protection of savers. It should create equal conditions for credit institutions, enable savers easily to understand the details of the deposit guarantee schemes, and facilitate rapid payment to savers from healthy and reliable deposit guarantee schemes in the interests of financial stability.

While maintaining the same coverage and target levels and abiding by the stipulated time limits for reimbursements and terms relating to the use of funds, Member States will thus have the opportunity to adapt their deposit guarantee schemes to national features of financial markets. By means of this approach, effective protection of depositors will be achieved and the stability of the financial system ensured. A higher coverage level is not sufficient to credibly protect depositors. In order to counteract the danger of bank runs and prevent a possible destabilisation of financial markets, deposit guarantee schemes must also be adequately financed. During the financial and economic crisis, however, it has become apparent that individual national deposit guarantee schemes in Europe were inadequately financed, so that the State and, ultimately, the taxpayer had to bear the consequences of the failure of a credit institution. In order for deposit guarantee schemes to have a stabilising effect at times of financial stress, it is therefore also necessary throughout the EU to finance deposit guarantee schemes adequately in advance (<span class="italic">ex ante</span>). Depositors must be better informed than has hitherto been the case about how deposit guarantee schemes operate and must be reimbursed rapidly if the occasion arises. Bringing the measures together will increase depositors’ confidence, promote the stability of the European financial system and help to build the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, banking establishments are confronted with the ‘bank run’ phenomenon, where depositors believe that their deposits are not safe and try to withdraw them at the same time. National deposit guarantee schemes in the European Union are particularly important for our citizens and offer additional confidence for creating bank deposits. The European guarantee schemes compensate depositors in the event of payment defaults up to a certain coverage level. The ceiling level was raised, first, from EUR 20 000 to EUR 50 000, and, as from 2011, to EUR 100 000 per depositor.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive applies to absolutely all credit institutions and membership in a deposit guarantee scheme becomes mandatory. In this way, we will ensure that depositors can always make a claim and that all systems are sufficiently funded. A higher level of protection increases depositors’ confidence and leads to the avoidance of simultaneous withdrawals of funds by many depositors for fear of losing their money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the financial and economic crisis, the coverage level was increased, pursuant to Directive 2009/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, initially from EUR 20 000 to EUR 50 000 and, as of 1 January 2011, finally, to EUR 100 000 per depositor. At the same time, the time limit for paying depositors was reduced to a maximum of 30 working days. The increased level of protection improves depositors’ confidence and thus helps to prevent simultaneous withdrawals by many depositors, known as bank runs. However, a higher coverage level alone is not sufficient to protect depositors credibly. In order to counteract the danger of bank runs and prevent a possible destabilisation of financial markets, DGSs must also be adequately financed. Bringing the measures together in this directive will increase depositors’ confidence, promote the stability of the European financial system and help to build the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The anticipated threshold of EUR 100 000 seems to be sufficient, as is the need for a short time limit for any potential payouts.

The longer maturity of bank assets makes the repayment of deposits difficult in the event of an unexpected and simultaneous withdrawal request from depositors. A ‘run on the bank’ could spread to other banks and compromise the stability not only of the banking system but also of the entire economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent this risk, a growing number of countries have introduced a system of deposit guarantees, following the example set by the United States. Deposit insurance has been shown to be effective in preventing bank panic, but it undermines market discipline in respect of management and shareholders and creates moral hazard problems. In fact, it lessens the incentive for depositors to monitor how the bank is being managed; a lack of attention from depositors may encourage the bank to employ riskier methods, given that they will reap any profits whilst any losses will be burdened by the deposit guarantee fund and, if this proves insufficient, by taxpayers.</p>

I am voting for this report because I believe there is a need to ensure effective coverage for deposits of up to EUR 100 000 in any currency, whether made by private individuals or businesses. There will also be a need to reduce the associated bureaucracy, speed up payments and go ahead with a wide range of measures enabling responsible and long-term finance for the 95% of deposits that are within the protected limit. I believe that Europeans will not only have better protection for their savings, but will also be able to choose the best savings product in any European country. Banks will already benefit from the scheme, since they will be able to offer competitive products throughout Europe without being limited by these differences. I also consider it crucial that measures intended to prevent future claims against DGSs be adopted, as it is advisable to predict and oversee banking activity regularly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some ways, the rapporteur’s proposal increases the level of protection for depositors: it establishes the legal right to a maximum reimbursement of EUR 100 000 and a shorter time limit for repayment. However, some aspects of this directive are cause for concern. For one thing, this directive is another step towards full implementation of the EU internal market. It leaves the way open for merging the DGSs of various Member States and for creating separate cross-border schemes on a voluntary basis. Another problem is that it fails to specify which institutions are responsible for financing DGSs. It cannot be the state, otherwise known as the taxpayer, that suffers the consequences of credit institutions’ failure when DGSs have not worked well enough.

This is how I could briefly sum up the essence of the ‘yes’ vote I cast for the report on the guidelines for the 2013 budgetary procedure. Through the European Parliament, the European Union has once again demonstrated its amazing ability and skill to implement an enlargement of great strategic importance such as the accession of Croatia in such a way as to not burden the multiannual financial framework adopted earlier. Additionally, I noted with satisfaction the emergence of a marked need to set up a working group for the independent evaluation of the EP budget, as well as those measures that are intended to keep the budget within the bounds of rationality and economy. There is no doubt that the institutional systems of the European Union, including the European Parliament itself, must take the lead in respect of the restrictive economic policy they promote and expect the domestic budgets of the individual Member States to meet.

The Vaughan report quite rightly advocates freezing the European Parliament’s budget for 2013. That is necessary, as we all know, for we must take appropriate action. However, we should not forget that the accession of Croatia runs the risk of increasing EU spending. We will need to be even more proactive than we are currently being, and anticipate budgetary adjustments as an imperative for future spending. As a way of showing solidarity with the citizens of Europe, it is only to be expected that we should freeze spending related to travel and our individual allowances until 2014. Alongside the measures linked to our individual allowances, the report advocates identifying long-term saving opportunities in order to maintain spending within the budgetary limits that we have set ourselves. It is vital to identify overlaps and inefficiencies across budgetary lines. As a result, in solidarity with the difficulties being experienced by many Member States, we are calling, through this report, for an independent evaluation of Parliament’s budget in order to make an objective analysis of the adjustments that need to be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I actively support the Single Seat campaign led by a group of MEPs who are committed to finding a solution to this issue. At a time of economic crisis, it is astonishing that the EU continues to spend millions of euro every year maintaining two seats. Apart from the financial aspect, it would also be hugely beneficial for the environment if we had one common seat and we avoided the regular transporting of people and materials between Brussels and Strasbourg. If we do not find a solution soon, there is a risk that this will undermine confidence in the European Parliament as an institution.

This should be done in a manner that is both effective and tangible, so as to be credible as regards the sacrifices that we are asking our fellow citizens to make day after day. Making savings, strengthening interinstitutional cooperation, sharing best practices between institutions and modernising policies on human resources, technology and environmental policy can, and must, become strategic objectives for the European Union institutions. This vote allows us to stress once again and with greater clout the fact that we must counter the need for drastic cuts in unproductive spending by multiplying our efforts to free up and make as many more resources available as possible so that we can get the global economy back on track as soon as possible and return hope to those who now easily succumb to the sirens of populist, anti-European sentiment. Citizens’ opinions of the institutions that govern them depend on the institutions’ ability to come across as sensitive to their needs and to the current difficulties, and, most importantly, the ability to put together suitable policies in order to ensure that we recover from this crisis as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More specifically, I would like to mention that I voted against Amendment 2 in favour of having a single seat for the European Parliament, because this is yet another attack against the seat in Strasbourg. I am, however, firmly in favour of maintaining the Strasbourg seat, not only for historical and symbolic reasons, but also in the name of the European Union’s principle of diversity. This is primarily a political matter affecting Parliament’s independence.

This budget would not have posed any major problems were it not for the tabling of an amendment requesting that the European Parliament should have only a single seat. To my great regret, that amendment was adopted, thereby paving the way for an internal battle between supporters and opponents of the Strasbourg seat. For the sake of convenience, some work is carried out in Brussels, but we should not forget that Strasbourg is the only official seat of the European Parliament; it is the symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, and the symbol of European unity that the founding fathers wished for. Today, MEPs have declared open war on Strasbourg. However, a report written by the European Association of Young Entrepreneurs, presented on 14 February, overturns the financial, institutional and environmental arguments put forward by critics.

Two days earlier, a report was presented making major corrections to the erroneous yet often-reported figures that set the annual cost of the Strasbourg seat at between EUR 169 million and EUR 203 million. The reality is quite different. According to the Parliament’s General Secretariat, the total specific cost for Strasbourg is EUR 51.5 million, that is, EUR 0.10 per inhabitant per year. Similarly, the carbon footprint estimate of 19 000 tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2</span> is four times higher than the real figure, which is actually 4 199 tonnes. I see that my colleagues will not give up their fight for the Strasbourg seat, and that this issue is actually more about politics than about the budget or the environment.

There is no doubt that we can achieve further savings by improving collaboration between the institutions and by cooperating more effectively in areas such as human resources, organisation and building management. However, despite all the need for savings, a number of areas exist where caution is advised.

We believe that guidelines to reduce the EU institutions’ spending are positive in general.

This equilibrium can, of course, only be determined in possession of accurate biological information. This issue is of special importance, primarily to coastal regions; however, by laying down precise rules and target numbers for this species, we are also facilitating the extension of regulations to other species of fish.

It falls to the European Union to use instruments such as the proposed multiannual plan to seek a fair balance between these interests and to find the best way to guide a fisheries policy that, in addition to renewing fish reserves, does not neglect those particularly involved in this sector. I hope that it will be possible to overcome the present interinstitutional deadlock on the proposed plan and that all the institutions will be able to contribute positively to increasing the capacity of Europe’s fisheries and to defending fisheries resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The planet’s resources are not unlimited and their exploitation should take this reality into account. Like many other fish species, the horse mackerel is very important for the European Union; we need a sustainable exploitation strategy, since the western horse mackerel stocks are the most important in EU waters. As such, multiannual plans based on scientific studies are enormously important in maintaining stocks, so they should be central to concerns in relation to the common fisheries policy. I voted for this motion for a resolution since it will contribute to maintaining the biomass of western horse mackerel stocks which, exploited sustainably, will, in turn, ensure a high long-term yield for fishers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution acknowledges exactly that. In the case of stocks of western horse mackerel, which is the most commercially important in European waters, the purpose of the multiannual report is to maintain the biomass of these stocks at a level that ensures their sustainable exploitation, and to provide the highest long-term yield. This objective is compromised by the institutional deadlock that has been preventing the adoption and effective implementation of the plan. This is a war between Parliament and the Council, in which Parliament wants to assert its power of codecision, since it believes the Council cannot keep the power to unilaterally change the parameters set out in the proposal for establishing total allowable catches, as these constitute core components of the proposed long-term plan. The adopted resolution stresses that the existing interinstitutional deadlock must be resolved for the sake of sustainable fish stocks and in order to enable fishing operators to better plan their activities in advance; this position seems correct to us. As such, it calls for dialogue between the three institutions, so as to overcome the impasse, in this case and in future ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Economically speaking, the western stocks are the most important stocks of horse mackerel in Union waters. Biological information on these stocks is insufficient for an overall assessment allowing fish mortality targets to be set for fishing related to the maximum sustainable yield, which could back up the total allowable catch with scientific forecasts in this area. According to the preventive scientific recommendations, the annual catch of western horse mackerel was supposed to be kept below 150 000 tonnes for several years from 2003, on the assumption that stocks would remain sustainable at this level of exploitation, even without an exceptionally large supplementation of stocks in the future.</p>

However, the target species of industrial fishing are generally those not destined for human consumption, that therefore have a reduced commercial value. These are small-sized species, often sandeels, Norway pout, sprat and blue whiting, but medium-sized species are also caught, such as the Atlantic horse mackerel, which we are discussing today in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial fishing is a fishing operation whose output is used for things other than food for humans. Incidentally, the European Union is concerned about adopting measures that reduce the by-catches of species such as haddock and whiting for human consumption. The most significant stage of production is an industrial process that, after the product has been ground, cooked and pressed, separates solid from liquid matter: the solid matter is crushed and made into meal, whilst the liquid matter is treated so that fish oil can be extracted.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Atlantic horse mackerel constitutes the main fish stock for this use throughout the European Union, I believe it to be advisable that, for a sustainable exploitation of and the highest long-term yield from the stock, once again in Parliament we look to support a sector that is of strategic importance for many European regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider it important that CFP reform considers the fact that destructive fishing practices are caused by neighbouring Member States in the regional hydrographic basins of other Member States, which cannot be separated from the problem of regional self-management for hydrographic basins. I consider it even more serious that the European Commission has refused to allow local fishing communities to reserve adequate protected areas around the coastline for their exclusive exploitation, which is currently destroying the sector in regions highly dependent on the traditional and small-scale fishing sectors, like the Azores. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament proposes various measures to achieve this objective, including positive discrimination, i.e. providing that those companies carrying out environmentally friendly fishing should enjoy improved access to the European Funds. Such a practice is already being used successfully in the common agricultural policy. The European Parliament also draws attention to the fact that fisheries is a particularly important sector of EU industry, providing citizens with high-quality food and creating economic and social added value. It is therefore particularly important to preserve fish stocks at a healthy level, so that fishing activities can continue in their traditional areas and communities in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In terms of food, which is the aspect most immediately comprehensible by consumers, the existence of this product makes an important contribution to the richness and variety of our diet. However, this is just one aspect of the many economic, environmental, cultural, scientific, recreational and tourism factors that are affected by this activity and that should be borne particularly in mind when setting out and implementing a common fisheries policy for the European Union. Without this cross-cutting and multidisciplinary approach, we will risk intervening in fishing in a way that reduces its impact and potency. As a citizen of the European country with the largest maritime area, I not only do not want that, but also consider it a strategic error.

That is why we have retained the resolution of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left and abstained in the vote on the joint resolution.

This is one of the reasons why we must make an effort to protect and maintain fish populations. The role of fisheries as a supplier of food for human beings is both long term and widely acknowledged. The fisheries sector, including wild and farmed fish, is an activity that contributes to the production of irreplaceable common goods through the three main strands of fishing, processing and marketing. The fisheries sector provides European citizens with high-quality food and creates economic and social added value for the EU. The reformed common fisheries policy (CFP) therefore needs to guarantee the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources and the preservation of fish stocks at a healthy level, in such a way that fishing activities can continue in their traditional areas and communities in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries sector is one of the most important pillars of food security in the European Union and, as such, its sustainability and stability must be guaranteed by the CFP reform, so that, in the future, it can provide fisheries products of sufficient quality and in sufficient quantity to satisfy the demand from more than half a billion EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A dynamic, well-managed fisheries sector could make an increasing contribution to European society and the European economy and thus play a significant role in the Europe 2020 strategy. The fisheries sector is an important EU industry which provides EU citizens with high-quality food and creates economic and social added value for the European Union. Therefore, the reformed CFP needs to guarantee the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources and the preservation of fish stocks at a healthy level, so that fishing activities can continue in their traditional areas and communities in the long term. Fishing activities, when all their dimensions are considered, including sustainable aquaculture, their direct and indirect impact, and the common goods produced by means of fishing activities, guarantee social and territorial cohesion and promote vocational training and social and economic dynamism, in line with the EU 2020 strategy for promoting inclusive growth. When drawing up its future policy proposals and decisions, the Commission must ensure that the CFP contributes to the implementation of overarching policy aims. The crucial process of CFP reform must recognise the CFP as a source of development in the context of the European Growth Project and it is therefore essential to create the conditions which enable it to develop its full potential. The Commission must take the specific characteristics of fisheries and coastal regions into account when developing and implementing these policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, fishing can only be understood through reference to something else with which it is interlinked: the sea. There are, therefore, cultural, recreational, scientific, energy, environmental and educational dimensions that should not be neglected. When consideration is given, for example, to traditional fishing, it is clear that it is more than a mere economic activity: it is a lifestyle and an ethnography; it is the history and world view of various coastal populations. Therefore, the CFP should adopt a holistic approach that systematically takes into account these varied factors: a hybrid model that compromises between economic and environmental sustainability, that coordinates traditional types of fishing and cutting-edge scientific research, and that balances the sea as a place of work and a place for recreation.

There is an official dialogue taking place between Hungary and the European Commission, and the European Parliament should wait until the Commission has delivered its analysis. Hungary is open to this dialogue. I find it unacceptable that the European Commission has come under political pressure. The current Hungarian Government is labouring to maintain a country that, in 2010, was indebted, vulnerable and barely able to withstand the negative impact of global economic changes as a functioning EU Member State. I reject the double standard demonstrated by left-wing parties and the international press who did not raise their voices against the former socialist government after the events of 2006, whereas now they seek to defame my home country with their uninformed and unfounded accusations. The country is even now facing financial problems and the government is trying to conclude a credit agreement. The financial world seems to have appeared as a new branch of power in European decision making, as the application of Article 7 of the Treaty of Lisbon would entail the suspension of the payment of EU support to Hungary. Anyone who proposes such a measure does not strengthen but, in fact, weakens European cohesion. All in all, I must stress that this is no longer about the acceptance of European values but about the political power and spreading influence of money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in the current European political debate, everything is mixed up: economic issues and, in particular, the independence of the Hungarian Central Bank are mixed up with the issue of the independence of the judiciary and the problematic points of the new constitution as regards its compliance with the constituent values of the Union. As far as I am concerned, the central bank is not the main focus. Civil liberties and full respect for democracy are much more important. We now need to reflect on the most appropriate way to counter the Hungarian regime’s drift towards authoritarianism. Could that be Article 7, which is mentioned so often? In my view, we instead need to support the democrats in Hungary at all costs, both citizens and politicians, who are committed to democracy and its values.

A motion for a resolution was tabled and debated in July 2011 – but was ultimately not voted on – that admonished Hungary for the lack of guarantees in its compliance with the EU principles and values. On 18 January 2012, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, was here to explain the Hungarian Government’s policy choices and the Fundamental Law of his country, which has fully incorporated the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Parliament cannot intervene in the adoption of the constitution of a Member State, which would be considered interference in a country’s sovereignty and is something that should be judged by the citizens of that country. It is incumbent on the Commission to engage in dialogue with the Hungarian Government in order to overcome any lack of compliance with the EU Treaties. The new Hungarian constitution has been agreed by a majority in the democratically elected Hungarian Parliament and has replaced the communist constitution of 1949. However, since the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, I believe it should act to ensure strict adherence thereto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way forward is not a choice between two versions of social regression: that of the Hungarian Government and that of the EU. It is telling that the Commission and certain elements of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are not concerned about the new Hungarian Labour Code and the setback in workers’ rights that this entails, about the attack on social rights, or about the intervention by the IMF; in short, about the cruel demands of social regression which the so-called austerity measures are imposing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since December 2010, the Orbán government has introduced worrying legislation: the media laws that significantly restrict freedom of the press; the cardinal laws which limit Hungary’s central bank and data protection agency; and a new constitution which imposes conservative ideology on the citizens by explicitly touching on the issue of abortions and same-sex marriage. While Prime Minister Viktor Orbán uses nice words to calm down our concerns, his words are void if not backed by consolidating actions. Having expressed our concerns about the situation in Hungary, it is our turn to transform our words into concrete actions. With the following resolution, the European Parliament requests an investigation into the compliance of Hungary’s recent legislation with the EU’s Treaties. We also instruct the European Commission to make use of legal measures, including Article 7 of the EU Treaty, in case Hungary fails to meet the legal obligations deriving from its EU membership.

Our resolution expresses serious concern at the situation in Hungary in relation to ‘the exercise of democracy, the rule of law, the respect and protection of human and social rights, the system of checks and balances’ and ‘equality and non-discrimination’. This was a major victory for Parliament. Our resolution explicitly mentions (this was the subject of paragraph 7, which I of course supported) Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which makes provision for a mechanism by which measures can be taken against a Member State when serious violations of the European principles have been proven. Up to now, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the two main political families of the European Parliament – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – were opposed on this issue. The European Parliament has therefore decided to call on that committee, on which I sit, which will be instructed to write a report verifying Hungary’s compliance with European laws and principles in the area of media freedom and as regards judicial reforms and the issue of the Hungarian Central Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is astonishing how much effort the EP can spend on putting one of the EU Member States in the pillory in the middle of an economic crisis. Where is European solidarity and justice when even the European Commission, which is theoretically supposed to form its opinions based on objective and thorough investigations, takes a biased stance towards an EU Member State? It would seem that individual thought does indeed have no place within the EU, and that efforts to resolve real problems have been replaced by superficial claptrap. I do not believe that after the closure of the infringement procedure initiated against Hungary – just one among hundreds of others – those politicians who are now inciting hate and speaking in unacceptable tones about a democratically elected and formed government will have a different attitude towards the Hungarian situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is shameful that there are so many Members who assist them in this, from both new and old Member States. The European Parliament has become the stage for irresponsible political squabbles, where it is far easier to deliver sonorous speeches and feign concern for a Member State than to fulfil the political duties promised to EU citizens. I deeply condemn the resolution, some points of which severely violate Hungary’s sovereignty, and which is politically motivated and completely removed from reality. The Socialist, Liberal and Green authors of the resolution have crossed a line, which is completely unacceptable in a place where they continuously preach about democracy and solidarity.

Some seem to trivialise what is happening in Hungary by simplifying it. However, it is not insignificant. What is happening in Hungary is dramatic for the very idea of the European project, which embodies humanism, openness, solidarity, progress, justice and equality – in short, universality. The European project is a rejection of intolerance, nationalism and isolationism. My criticism of the measures taken lies in the fact that they commit the ‘sin’ of being biased. This is an attempt to establish a biased State, a State in the service of a political force. These measures, which are to become legislative and/or constitutional acts, are causing a European country to swing from a democratic regime to an authoritarian one. People are now afraid to speak out, complain or express an independent opinion. This transformation from a democratic regime into an authoritarian regime in a European country is extremely serious for the very idea of the European project. It goes beyond the limits of what is tolerable. We cannot accept what I call ‘the majority tyranny’.

We now hear arguments that fundamental freedoms are under threat and that the EU is therefore concerned about the position of the Hungarian people. Of course, breaches of basic rights cannot be permitted in any EU Member State. The high level of fundamental rights and freedoms must be maintained and upheld. Nonetheless, in relation to the criticism of Hungary, the question arises whether everyone’s motivations are entirely pure. Hungary has elected a government of the ‘right’, which is obviously a thorn in sides of the ‘left-leaning’ governments in other Member States and those politically correct Members of this House. Thus, some fairly flimsy arguments have been brought forward and we have heard criticism of things that are tolerated in other Member States.

Not all Member States of the Union have the same high standards when it comes to protecting human rights, which is, of course, regrettable.

The new Hungarian constitution, apart from providing a good advertisement for the Apple company (since part of it was reportedly written on Apple’s top-selling tablet), has also caused many protests in the country and a wave of displeasure in Brussels. The contentious laws in the new Hungarian constitution relate, for example, to Hungarian central bank independence, the retirement of judges, data protection office independence and the controversial media law. The developments in Hungary are, unfortunately, highly disappointing. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán shuttles between Budapest and Brussels, where he says something different every time. This irresponsible conduct on the part of the Hungarian Government resulted in the Commission’s monthly ultimatum to amend the disputed laws. The response to the criticism was quick, taking the form of an absurd allegation of some sort of social-liberal democratic plot. It seems that Viktor Orbán does not want to acknowledge that he is mostly harming his own citizens through his efforts to concentrate as much power as possible in the hands of the prime minister. Our main task is to defend the interests of EU citizens – and that includes the citizens of Hungary.

With this vote, we stress that there is no threat to democracy in Hungary. Each Member State, in fact, has the sovereign power to draft its own constitution and this principle corresponds to the sovereignty of its people from the perspective of self-determination through democracy. It is to be hoped that the Hungarian Government will work closely with the European Commission to ensure that new national legislation conforms with EU law and, if necessary, to introduce changes. Despite this, there is no threat to democracy in Hungary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 19 January 2012, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, came before Parliament to clarify his position, assuring this House that the more controversial laws strengthening political control over several of his country’s institutions would be amended. In a letter sent to the Hungarian Government, the Commission expressed its strong concern, in particular, with regard to the independence of the central bank, the data protection authority and the judiciary. However, many NGOs in the country are accusing the Hungarian authorities of abuses of freedom of expression, religion and sexual orientation. Moreover, the Hungarian Government has adopted several retroactive laws that violate one of the basic principles of EU law. As Hungary is governed by the rule of law and is an EU Member State, I believe that it is vital that laws jeopardising the principles of democracy and freedom be reviewed in conjunction with the Commission. We cannot invoke particular principles and values in our foreign policy if there are Member States in breach of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only recently, France passed a law imposing a new official and unassailable historical ‘truth’, this time about the Armenian genocide.

In a number of mass demonstrations since the Duma elections of 4 December 2011, the Russian people have expressed their desire for more democracy, including free and fair elections and a comprehensive reform of the electoral system. We, Members of the European Parliament, call on the Russian authorities to uphold fully freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in compliance with the constitution of the Russian Federation, and to introduce a package of legislative proposals aimed at developing a truly democratic political system. Moreover, Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s continuing incarceration raises serious questions about Russia’s commitment to the rule of law, judicial independence and human rights. Observers attending his second trial condemned it as failing to meet acceptable standards of due process and independence. The EU must insist on Russia meeting its obligations under international law with regard to civil, political and human rights. The Kremlin should also act on the recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights, which has been highly critical of the conduct of the Khodorkovsky trial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The results that the political and economic relationship between the EU and Russia have yielded so far are undeniable, but the recent public mood and the investigations and reports, as well as the attitude taken in respect of Syria (the UN veto and arms sales) provide grounds for grave conclusions. All this is no doubt due in part to the upcoming Russian presidential elections and the preceding campaign, but the EU must not disregard the facts which indicate a shift towards the endangering of political pluralism and the fairness of the elections, the prospect of resorting to intimidation, the restriction of the freedom to express sexual orientation or sexual identity, and other anti-democratic measures which seriously violate the achievements that have been made and put into practice in the field of human rights so far.

There is the risk that pluralism may be compromised through the seemingly arbitrary and completely unjustified barring of several candidates from standing. The reforms of the political and party systems announced by the outgoing President, Mr Medvedev, constitute a step forward in terms of transparency, but further action is needed to complete the country’s democratic transformation. The European Union has a duty to monitor and support Russia’s efforts in this undertaking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, there is an irony in the EU lecturing Russia about the fundamentals of democracy and the need for utmost integrity in the electoral process. Ask the people of Greece, or of Italy, if their democratic voice has been respected by the EU and the answer will be a resounding ‘no’. Both countries today have leaders and decisions of Brussels’ liking, not of their own.

The fact is that there does not seem to be a genuine European interest in Russia, or only an interest in terms of reacting to it or comparing the country to our own standards. Despite the importance of such standards, they should not make us forget the geostrategic importance of the largest country in the world. Russia is at a crossroads between liberal democracy and state capitalism, and has recently shown signs of leaning towards the latter model, as seen in its recent veto in relation to Syria in the United National Security Council. Reports on the freedom and fairness of the electoral process lead us to fear that the next presidential elections may also breach international standards. Russia would benefit if it adopted Western standards of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and the West would benefit if, in its turn, it became more interested in the real Russia, in order to better understand and influence it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation will also continue to be of key significance in terms of intensifying cooperation between the two partners. However, concerns persist over developments in the Russian Federation regarding the observance and protection of human rights and adherence to commonly agreed democratic principles, election rules and procedures. The Russian Federation, as a full member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), has an obligation to defend the principles of democracy and human rights. According to the final observer’s report of the OSCE/Office for Democratic Rights and Institutions, the elections to the Duma on 4 December 2011 did not fully comply with the principles of free and fair elections, and were marked by interference from the state and the government party, including a lack of independence of election authorities, media bias and state interference at various levels. Russian citizens have, in a number of mass demonstrations, expressed their desire for greater democracy and a comprehensive reform of the electoral system. In my opinion, it would be right and proper to see the recent demonstrations in this light – as an opportunity to respond to the call of the Russian people for more democracy, electoral law reform and compliance with the standards of the Council of Europe and the OSCE in cooperation with the Venice Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is still concern about developments in the Russian Federation with regard to respect for, and the protection of, human rights, and to compliance with commonly agreed democratic principles, electoral rules and procedures. The Russian Federation is a full member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and has therefore committed itself to upholding the principles of democracy and human rights. On 12 April 2011, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the cumbersome registration procedures for political parties in Russia, which do not meet the electoral standards set by the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and ruled that the limitations on the registration of political parties and candidates restricts political competition and pluralism in Russia.

It is complaining about familiar irregularities in the hope of possibly influencing the forthcoming ballot. The Union is angry because Russia has twice voted against intervention in Syria in the United Nations Security Council, which is why the EU is taking a rather superior tone here, while omitting to start by cleaning up its own act first. It is unfortunately the case that the broad fundamental freedoms enjoyed in some EU States are not common to all Member States. However, the EU should seek to improve the lot of its own citizens before seeking to interfere in other countries. The fact is that the principle of freedom of expression is only partially honoured in some States, or is increasingly restricted as a result of new laws, as in the new catch-all anti-persecution law in Austria, for example. The recitals in relation to the resolution state that greater cooperation and improved relations with Russia will bring greater stability, prosperity and security. This motion for a resolution achieves the exact opposite. Russia is an independent country and this fact must be afforded greater respect. Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of this motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European organisations have repeatedly expressed the hope that general elections in Russia will comply with legal standards, and on each occasion after the elections, they have expressed regret that democratic standards have not been observed.

However, the recent demonstrations in Russia following the rigged parliamentary elections in December show that ordinary Russians are losing patience with their authoritarian government. Putin will inevitably return to the Presidency in March but he will hopefully take account of the demands of the opposition, one of which is the immediate release of political prisoners such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky. At the very least, Putin should act on the findings of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights, which was highly critical of the conduct of Khodorkovsky’s second trial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The abuses of the electoral process reported by various NGOs and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe should not be repeated in the next presidential elections on 4 March, as stated by the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, who believes that Russia needs to have democracy and combat the corruption found in all areas of society. I consider it vital for the upcoming elections to be monitored closely by the EU and international institutions, from the preparations to the actual election, in order to prevent the array of irregularities seen during the previous elections. However, there is a need to ensure that the electoral observers are not subject to any pressure or obstacles by the local authorities. The Russian people have already shown that they want an open society in which values such as political pluralism, freedom of expression, assembly and the press, and the rule of law are guaranteed as fundamental rights. Once again, I would reiterate that I am hoping that the Russian political system will become democratic so that it can have a voice and build its future, giving expression to the capabilities of a country like Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thousands more have left their homeland for the UK as business exiles. Since Vladimir Putin became President of Russia in 1999, no elections in the country have been recognised by Western observers as free and democratic. At the most recent Duma elections in December, the OSCE witnessed blatant fraud, including the unashamed stuffing of ballot boxes. Corruption in Russia is endemic, with bribes accounting for 20% of the country’s GDP. I am also increasingly concerned about abuses of human rights and restrictions on the freedom of expression, including the unexplained deaths of journalists. Things must change in Russia. Russia must strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure that fundamental rights are respected. The country must also become a more responsible actor on the international stage.

We should take into particular consideration the wish expressed by many Russian people for real improvements to be made to the Russian electoral system, eliminating the practice adopted hitherto of ensuring the total domination of one ‘essential’ party in the Russian State Duma by unfair means, and creating a real opportunity for alternative candidates to Vladimir Putin or Dmitri Medvedev to stand in the presidential election and be successful. The resolution rightly states that a strategic partnership between the EU and Russia can only be built on shared common values. For Latvia, as a country neighbouring Russia, it is important for a transition finally to be made in Russia to true democracy, which would not only promote closer economic relations between our two countries but, possibly, would also clear the way to the development of a common understanding about historical events. A democratic Russia is the only opportunity for looking forward to the development of a new foreign policy approach in our neighbour, one that is not based on empire building ambitions and dreams of keeping hold and increasing power and influence in Russia’s neighbouring states. I must, however, express my regret that in the final wording of the resolution, the reference to the need to diversify the supply of energy to the EU, included in the original draft resolution by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, has disappeared. Another point that has disappeared is the call to the EU not to apply double standards in its relations with Russia, such as exemption from some of the conditions included in the third legislative package on energy directed towards ensuring free access to energy supply and distribution networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, these positive decisions were quickly blocked and overshadowed by the brutal suppression of protests and harassment of the opposition. It should be noted that this is an opposition that remains outside the parliament. We have no tools to directly support it, but we can invite its representatives to Parliament and promote its activities in Russia. Especially now, during the pre-election period, we have a great opportunity for international criticism of the actions of Russian authorities and support for the opposition to bring two-fold results. Not only does it force the authorities to explain themselves, but it also legitimises and grants international recognition to the pro-democratic opposition movements.

Furthermore, there is no safeguard against the exploitation of workers on large farms. On the other hand, the document does not answer the concerns expressed by the representatives of European producers in the fruit and vegetable sectors. They have repeatedly demanded the inclusion of clauses that would protect them against unfair competition from the Moroccan producers. At the same time, it is important that all imported goods comply with the EU’s phytosanitary rules.

It is worth noting that trade in agricultural and fishery products constitutes approximately 18% of Morocco’s exports, while people in rural areas working in the agricultural sector represent as much as 75% of the entire workforce, and this demonstrates that the stability and development of this sector is crucial for the political stability of the country.

The fact is that the text presented to the European Parliament is imbalanced. In terms of content, this agreement risks making the fruit and vegetable sector more fragile, when it has already been bled dry, without providing sufficient guarantees to limit distortions of competition between producers on the two sides of the Mediterranean. That is why it is vital for the EU to commit to real structural reforms in order to maintain an active Euro-Mediterranean agricultural sector, particularly in the framework of the future common agricultural policy (CAP). As regards the form, it is deplorable that Parliament can only declare itself for or against. The Commission should change this method by allowing Parliament to participate upstream in the discussions. Furthermore, the Commission should have undertaken an impact assessment on the economic, social and environmental consequences before concluding this agreement, not after. However, apart from those aspects relating to economics and trade, this agreement has a political and strategic dimension for the EU and Morocco. It provides support for the stability of a partner that has succeeded in making considerable political reforms and continuing the process of modernisation in a troubled regional environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following Parliament’s regrettable rejection of the protocol between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco, establishing the fisheries opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco, I believe it is time to keep the door open to the possibility of coming to an understanding with one of the Muslim countries that has recently shown most signs of moderation and capacity for reform. I am not unaware of the reservations that such liberalisation elicits, in particular, amongst European agricultural and industrial producers. I hope that the practical implementation of this decision will be monitored closely and that it will provide for clauses safeguarding these producers in cases of particular need. Nevertheless, I believe that a significant opening up of these markets could lead to more opportunities for investment and employment in Europe, and greater consumer access to products produced in the southern Mediterranean which strictly meet the same health and safety requirements as are imposed in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are tired arguments that have been repeated under many different circumstances over the years, and which reality stubbornly resists. These arguments have even been made within the EU itself, where the opening up and capitalist integration of market economies with very different levels of development has led to increased inequality. Moreover, it does not refrain from using the rhetoric of the Arab Spring, forgetting the Moroccan regime’s continued repression of the Sahrawi people. It forgets the illegal occupation of the territory of Western Sahara. If forgets that even other countries which have signed similar trade agreements with Morocco, such as the US, explicitly provide for the exclusion of products originating in Western Sahara; something that the EU does not do. It is significant that Portuguese, Spanish and Italian Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), representing countries whose farmers will be most affected, have voted against this agreement, even though they have, on other occasions, extolled the wonders of free trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In December 2010, the EU Council signed a document which, after ratification by the European Parliament, made it possible to proceed to the second phase of trade liberalisation with agricultural products and fishery products between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco. In respect of agriculture and fisheries, this new agreement gives mutual precedence to strengthening capital intensive industrial agriculture at the expense of family and small-scale agriculture. Increasing quotas with reduced rates for a broad range of fruit and vegetables will lead to a situation where European producers find it difficult to compete, without even strengthening the balanced development of agriculture in Morocco. We must not forget the EU’s commitments in relation to the Arab Spring regarding assistance for the southern Mediterranean countries in the transition to democracy by means of commercial and business instruments in order to secure a greater level of freedom and more economic opportunities. In this context, the agreement in question looks like a positive step, leading to support for political stabilisation and mutual, sustainable economic development. Liberalisation of trade between the EU and Morocco can lead to mutual benefits, greater economic growth, prosperity, job creation and the elimination of poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must consider that Moroccan farmers not only have production and labour costs which are far lower than those borne in the EU, but they are also not even required to respect the same production standards regarding the environment and food safety. It would therefore be appropriate, first and foremost, to carry out an impact study on the possible economic and social consequences of this liberalisation before it is applied.</p>

What is more, the agreement still fails to address an issue that is crucial in any trade relationship: products’ social and democratic quality, the exploitative conditions endured by Moroccan farmers, and the social dumping that accompanies market liberalisation, that is, making European and Moroccan agricultural products compete on the basis of price. Morocco continues to be excused of any requirement to fulfil and guarantee minimum standards in the area of social relations, employment or plant protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to do this, it was important to ensure that, following long negotiations, the agreement on reciprocal agricultural liberalisation was not rejected. However, this agreement, such as it has been presented to us, raises a number of questions. Unfortunately, Parliament could only choose between accepting and rejecting this agreement, without having the option to amend it. This resolution was therefore a necessary one, and, although I would have liked it to go even further – I am thinking primarily of producers in the south-west – I supported it. In this report, we firstly stress the importance of small farmers benefiting from the agreement. Secondly, we call on the Commission to carry out an impact assessment of the agreement on European producers, something which should have been done beforehand. I supported the amendment highlighting the need to compensate any negative impact that they might experience, but it was unfortunately rejected. Thirdly, we ask the Commission to promote equivalent measures and controls between Morocco and the European Union on environment and food safety standards. Finally, we call on Morocco to improve its water management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Contrary to the requests of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which had been instructed to draw up an opinion for the Committee on International Trade, which is the competent committee in this area, on 26 January, Parliament’s Committee on International Trade approved the conclusion of the trade liberalisation agreement between the EU and Morocco.</p>

<p class="contents">Were this agreement to be concluded, there would be a considerable increase in products originating from Morocco, with the introduction of import quotas much higher than under the previous agreement, specifically for six products: tomatoes, courgettes, cucumbers, garlic, citrus fruits and strawberries.

Moreover, there is the dispute in the United Nations over the region of Western Sahara, which should not be included in this agreement, since it is not Moroccan territory.

Increasing numbers of products will enter Europe originating from Morocco, where they are produced and cultivated at very low costs without any respect for social standards and often using child labour. Products will enter our markets which do not respect the same quality and safety standards for consumers that European producers are required to respect. Finally, the agreement will not even result in any improvements for Moroccan counterparts, because it will only be a few major agricultural and food groups that benefit from the situation, and certainly not small and medium-sized producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement also sets seasonal quotas with a view to combating distortions on the EU market and recalls that Moroccan imports should meet European hygiene standards.

The rapporteur, José Bové, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are fundamentally opposed to its adoption. In view of the events in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria, it should be emphasised that the agreements on liberalisation introduced so far have failed to achieve the stated objectives, and we cannot therefore continue with a policy which favours the economic interests of powerful entities without assessing the social impacts on the population and the damage caused to the environment and the climate. The report has particularly drastic negative consequences for European and North African agriculture and fishing because it strengthens industrial agriculture at the expense of sustainable agriculture. It confronts European producers with unfair competition in the form of dumping based on child labour and jobs with no social standards whatsoever. For North Africa, the submitted report is harmful for the environment in particular. Powerful agricultural interests draw underground freshwater for their own agricultural profit in such a way that its surface is falling by 1.5 metres a year on average. For example, in Morocco, it takes 100 litres of water to grow one kilogramme of tomatoes, compared to 10 litres of water in France or Germany.

There are at least two strong reasons to reject this agreement. Firstly, it will harm European producers, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises of typically Mediterranean crops, particularly in the area of fruit and vegetables, since this agreement increases the pressure being felt today from low base prices and the difficulties experienced by many producers in distributing their products. Portuguese farmers will be hit particularly hard by this. Secondly, family farming will be another loser, as it is starting to face competition from intensive production and export-oriented models. Such models threaten environmental sustainability, the viability of regional and local markets, and food sovereignty, while also reducing food quality and safety. For these reasons, consumers and populations also lose out. Those who benefit most are large European companies and multinational distributors, who will thus be able to win new markets and access cheap labour, as well as have a better chance of circumventing social, employment and environmental standards in force in European countries. Finally, we cannot accept that the Commission is still ignoring the issue of Western Sahara, which is being illegally occupied by Morocco, with a total lack of respect for international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In December 2010, the EU Council signed a document which, after ratification by the European Parliament, made it possible to proceed to the second phase of trade liberalisation with agricultural products and fishery products between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco. In respect of agriculture and fisheries, this new agreement gives mutual precedence to strengthening capital intensive industrial agriculture at the expense of family and small-scale agriculture. Increasing quotas with reduced rates for a broad range of fruit and vegetables will lead to a situation where European producers find it difficult to compete, without even strengthening the balanced development of agriculture in Morocco. We must not forget the EU’s commitments in relation to the Arab Spring regarding assistance for the southern Mediterranean countries in the transition to democracy by means of commercial and business instruments in order to secure a greater level of freedom and more economic opportunities. In this context, the agreement in question looks like a positive step, leading to support for political stabilisation and mutual, sustainable economic development. Liberalisation of trade between the EU and Morocco can lead to mutual benefits, greater economic growth, prosperity, job creation and the elimination of poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, by immediately liberalising 55% of European imports from Morocco, many typical fruit and vegetable producers in Italy would be threatened by the entry on to the European market of products obtained on more competitive terms. We must consider that Moroccan farmers not only have production and labour costs which are far lower than those borne in the EU, but they are also not even required to respect the same production standards regarding the environment and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be appropriate, first and foremost, to carry out an impact study on the possible economic and social consequences of this liberalisation before it is applied. I therefore hope that there is a desire to review the proposed agreement to safeguard the principle of reciprocity and the possibility for our farmers to compete within a competitive context which, if not equal, is at least sustainable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to reassure them that there are guarantees. Given the sensitive nature of this sector and the offensive capability of Morocco, mechanisms for preserving this area have been implemented. In particular, this involves maintaining quotas for the most sensitive products (tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, clementines and so on) which will be subject to monthly management, maintaining entry prices for fruit and vegetables, and a safeguard clause. Specific provisions have also been provided for tomatoes, which are in a very challenging position. The liberalisation that Morocco has agreed to will also contribute to strengthening the position of European exporters on the Moroccan market with an immediate and almost total liberalisation of certain sectors. Finally, this agreement enshrines a commitment made in 2008 when Morocco obtained ‘advanced status’.

The circumventing of the system for import entry prices is considered by a large number of producer organisations to be a matter of deep concern for the sector, particularly with regard to fresh tomatoes. Operators profit from problems with the system, making improper use of current provisions on the customs valuation to cut the import duties due on fruit and vegetables. FEPEX (the Spanish Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Producers and Exporters) has even filed a complaint with Parliament’s Committee on Petitions regarding this very problem. Before opening up the markets any further to additional quotas, there must be effective tariff protection and verification of imported values. Turning to the environment, the outlook here is also negative and calls into question the European Union’s principle of protecting the environment and minimising likely climate change. So far, the social, environmental and economic impacts of this agreement have not always been assessed by the Commission, which has concentrated on tariff matters.

However, the required certification and labelling do not protect them sufficiently or encourage consumers to give preference to their products over those produced to lower standards and at lower cost. The liberalisation of 55% of exports from Morocco to the European Union and the increase in concessions in the fruit and vegetable sectors represents a severe blow to producers in southern Europe, particularly Portugal, but also Spain, Italy, Greece and France; all Member States experiencing difficulties that must rely on their productive sectors and not, once again, see their agriculture sacrificed to other interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political and strategic considerations, the need for development of neighbourly cooperation and the economic and democratisation reforms implemented in the country show a need for further rapprochement and development of cooperation. The proposed trade agreement is indeed more favourable to Morocco; however, the country has only just set out on the road to development. The rapporteur believes that the agreement is more harmful to Moroccan farmers than to European farmers, that liberalisation will benefit mainly the large corporations with European capital, including French companies that control trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission argues that trade will be closely monitored, that the increase in imports of tomatoes will be negligible, and that imported fruit and vegetables will meet quality and production standards. Questions remain as to the social conditions offered to those employed in their production, including children, and other standards in the production process. It is also true that other countries are also interested in the Moroccan market, and it would be hard for the neighbouring European Union to remain inactive.

I believe that trade liberalisation and progressive integration into the EU’s internal market will help to alleviate the widespread poverty and unemployment in the region, trade and investment being proven engines for growth. It is our hope that such an agreement would also help to bring people together and to secure ties between nations. It is worth pointing out that whereas only 5% of EU citizens are employed in agriculture, 38% of the Moroccan workforce is employed by the sector. This agreement does not just bring benefits to Morocco, but also creates significant advantages for the EU. It will provide significant opportunities for the EU’s agricultural industry, particularly in processed foods, and it is estimated that, eventually, up to EUR 100 million will be saved in customs duties once Moroccan import tariffs for 70% of agricultural and fisheries product lines have been removed.</p>

Under this agreement, Morocco will automatically liberalise its agricultural sector to cover approximately 45% of the imports from the EU, to reach 70% in 10 years. In its turn, the EU will liberalise approximately 55% of its imports from Morocco under the agreement. Although Morocco will open up further in the long term, there are several points which put the EU at a disadvantage. Firstly, I would like to emphasise that we should impose the same phytosanitary measures and take account of the fact that the cost of labour is substantially lower in Morocco than in the EU. These two elements alone make agricultural products originating in the EU much more expensive. Secondly, there is the issue of the region of Western Sahara, which is included in the agreement, while, according to the United Nations, it should not be, as it is a disputed territory. Finally, I would like to stress that this agreement will bring benefits only for large-scale farms, with no benefit for 90% of Moroccan farmers. I believe that Morocco is engaged in a real process of democratisation.

This agreement goes against the interests of farmers and small producers on both sides of the Mediterranean and will only benefit big business and the King of Morocco himself, who owns more than 12 000 hectares of land. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) has worked with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and José Bové, who has led the fight over this issue, to put forward an alternative resolution. Our resolution observes that following the Arab Spring, the European Union should no longer dare to dictate unequal relationships, guided solely by the desire to impose its liberal model (the harmfulness of which grows clearer every day) to the detriment of fundamental principles such as food sovereignty. Within this resolution, we also took the opportunity to remark that this agreement should not apply to the Western Sahara. The European Commission responded that ‘the United Nations considers the Western Sahara to be a non-autonomous territory and deems Morocco to be its <span class="italic">de facto</span> administrative power’.

What measures does she intend to adopt in order to prevent innocent children from being subject to further torture and sexual violence and to put an end to violations of human rights, respect for human dignity and the integrity of freedom? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The violent acts against civilians that have been taking place in Syria since March 2011 violate every aspect of humanity. UN estimates indicate that by now, the number of victims has reached 6 000, and this number is growing day by day. With all these horrors, one of the most tragic facts to me is that according to UNICEF reports, there are, at this point, 400 children and young people counted among the victims. It is deeply condemnable that almost 380 additional young people can be confirmed to have fallen victim to arbitrary imprisonment, torture and sexual abuse. These crimes violate all aspects of human rights and children’s rights to the fullest extent and it has therefore become imperative that the European Union takes action in this matter as quickly and as firmly as possible. I find it a positive development in respect of overcoming the situation in Syria that the Arab League has unanimously condemned the events that are taking place in the country, and Europe must therefore continue to act in unison when taking its measures to curb further aggression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European commitment was demonstrated by restrictive measures that came into force on 18 January 2012, and additional sanctions adopted by the European Council of 23 January 2012. In particular, the additional restrictions on the transfer of funds and the provision of financial services are likely to affect the Syrian’s regime’s ability to purchase new equipment that could be used for repressive purposes. International pressure must be intensified to persuade the Syrian regime to stop violence and open the way to a peaceful democratic transition.</p>

In these circumstances, the European Commission’s decision of January on providing humanitarian assistance is welcomed. It is, however, necessary to reinforce the capacities of the EU Mission in Damascus in humanitarian matters.

In addition to thousands of deaths and the destruction of important infrastructure, they have cleared political space for those countries’ most reactionary and retrograde forces. With this resolution, the majority in Parliament are impeding the peaceful solution that is needed. They are backing disrespect for the sovereignty of the Syrian people, and refusing to support national dialogue and diplomatic efforts within the UN to prevent the internal situation from escalating. They are on the side of the NATO powers, and of the region’s obscurantist and reactionary monarchies in funding and supplying arms for the groups that have been attacking civilian populations and public buildings, and abducting and killing innocent civilians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Towns and villages throughout Syria are surrounded and bombarded, access to food and basic needs is extremely difficult, and many Syrians are facing a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation due to displacement. Despite widespread international condemnation of the violence and human rights violations, which include torture and sexual violence, the crimes against humanity are continuing, targeting peaceful civilians, including children. There is a risk that the polarised situation in Syria will even lead to civil war. President Bashar al-Assad’s numerous promises of reforms and promises to grant amnesties were never implemented, and the regime has thus lost all credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there are growing calls for the President to step down.

The EU and the world have to finally rise up to the level of the standards to which they have committed themselves and put an end to the continuing exercise of violence by the Syrian regime against its own people. The continued ignoring by the Syrian Government of the appeals of the international community is bound to have a devastating effect on the human rights situation all over the world. The immediate goal is to stop immediately wide-scale human rights violations including mass arrests, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill treatment of detainees. The EU has to put more pressure on Russia and China to join the joint UN Security Council resolution without further delay. Any proliferation of arms to Syria from third countries has to be eliminated. It is a disgrace that Russia proclaims its support for a negotiated settlement but, at the same time, keeps delivering weapons to Syria.

Even though there are bloody conflicts in several locations worldwide, the conflict in Syria is attracting the most attention, not only because of the propaganda campaign but also because it presents the most dangerous threat of escalation. Our stance on the civil war in Syria must be based on the tragic historical experience of our own part of the world, and on the European humanist tradition. It must be based on the need to defend peace and human life. In my opinion, the greatest obstacle to achieving this goal is the unwillingness of certain armed groups to come to the negotiating table. This unwillingness stems from a conviction of inevitable victory over the government by means of violence, as a result of the expected support of NATO. It is highly likely that someone from abroad is supporting these armed groups in their rejection of negotiation. This fact is also reflected in the arming of, and media support for, the uprising. I am not coming forward in any way as a defender of the current regime in Damascus. I simply have a firm belief that, even after the events in Libya, the only path to peace is through compromise and reform. I consider the attempts at violent regime change from abroad in selected states as wholly unacceptable. I would like to make the elementary point that the UN Charter is based on the principle of sovereignty of individual states. Any other approach will only increase chaos in an already unstable world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In such situations, it is always preferable to find a political solution to the situation: therefore, the veto exercised on 4 February by Russia and China in relation to the draft resolution of the United Nations Security Council, which was moving in the right direction with the necessary cooperation of the Arab League, must be condemned. The Middle East has always been a very critical area, and the instability of a country may cause negative repercussions throughout the region. It is therefore necessary to take action as quickly as possible in an attempt to resolve the situation. I believe that the European Parliament has done the right thing today in expressing this position and, for this reason, I support the joint motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe this position gives credits in internal politics; the citizens of Russia must be wondering whether tolerance to the deeds of the al-Assad regime means such measures against opposition are also an option internally. The EU must utilise its dialogues with both China and Russia to persuade them to stand on the side of universal values (especially since the EU-Russia strategic and extensive partnership is declared to be built upon common values). The EU High Representative should bring a clear mandate and a united EU position to the meeting of Friends of Syria.

The situation in Syria, however, is not as straightforward as it may seem, and it is closely linked with the events unfolding throughout the region. This is not just another part of the Arab revolution; it is also a struggle for influence between the West and the Russo-Iranian tandem. Without the consent of those states, therefore, President Assad cannot be removed from power. The most recent meeting of the UN Security Council was a prime example. We should also remember that the situation in Syria is not as unambiguous as some sources report. The President still enjoys considerable support, in particular, in large cities, and the Alawites and the Christian community which support him represent over 30% of society.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these years, the authorities in Damascus have eased religious conflicts, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> by banning the Muslim Brotherhood. Today, in districts of Homs and Idlib which have been abandoned by the army, there are ongoing clashes between the Alawites and the Sunnis. We thus have to assume that after the fall of Assad, there will be an escalation in sectarian strife. There is no close tie between the Syrian National Council residing in Istanbul and the demonstrators dying in the streets of Homs. Nevertheless, the European Union should strongly condemn the killing of unarmed civilians, including children, who account for over 10% of the victims of this conflict. We should put pressure on Assad to organise humanitarian corridors and allow the civilian population to leave the besieged cities, which would greatly reduce the losses caused by the fighting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, Members of the European Parliament, welcome the designation of Burma/Myanmar, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Syria, Libya and Iran as key issues, as those issues are also priorities of the EU. We also reiterate once more the call to EU Member States to actively oppose any attempt to undermine the concept of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights. We also condemn in the strongest terms the widespread brutal repression and systematic violations of human rights by the Syrian regime against its population, including children, and call on the Syrian authorities to bring an immediate end to violence and to comply with their obligations under international human rights law in order to allow a peaceful and democratic transition. In this regard, the decision to establish the mandate of special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Syria is highly welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union promotes respect for fundamental rights and democracy throughout the world, and is legally bound to respect them by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Consequently, it must take action in order to ensure that the protection of these rights is a priority within the activities of the United Nations and accordingly provide its full support to actions carried out within that context. I am pleased with the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council and hope that its next meeting will be concluded with further progress on this score. I hope, above all, that the obstacle created within the Security Council regarding the situation in Syria will quickly be overcome. Unacceptable violations of human rights are ongoing and the international community cannot remain silent.

I note with regret that the High Representative will not be attending its next session.

I hope that the Union will live up to its history at the 19th session of the UN Human Rights Council, and will contribute to asserting these rights on the global agenda.

At these internal sessions, it is a case of asserting the fundamental reading of the EU on the stage of international politics, particularly as regards the protection of human rights.

In the field of human rights, the adoption of binding standards is key to rapid progress and concrete improvement on the ground.

It is therefore imperative that the European Union and its Member States work together in favour of a specialised intergovernmental platform: the United Nations Human Rights Council.

The reputation of Europe has been severely dented and will soon be beyond repair. This may be felt not only within Europe, but among other members of the UN Human Rights Council. The Human Rights Watch Annual Report, published last month, issued a reminder that the EU and its Member States must bring to an end the era of double standards. The report describes in detail how EU states, including Lithuania, have demonstrated an unwillingness to tackle human rights abuses within their own countries. I quote: ‘The sad truth is that EU governments too often set aside rights at home when they prove inconvenient, especially those of vulnerable minorities, and brush aside criticism of abuse’. This can be said of Lithuania which, in the Democracy Index published in January, was described as a ‘flawed democracy’.

Moreover, there is much to say about these violations in and/or by the EU. They hypocritically pronounce themselves in favour of the ‘indivisibility’ and ‘universality’ of human rights, but they have been supporting the cruel demands on the peoples of countries like Portugal or Greece by the EU, the IMF and their national governments, who have imposed restrictions on the right to work and the rights of workers, and on the right to health care, education and housing, and have compromised peoples’ right to sovereignty and development. Also hypocritical are the lack of clear references – and of any reference, in some cases – to the systematic human rights violations by the United States at the illegal base of Guantánamo in Cuba, to the massacres of thousands of civilians by NATO in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Libya, to the occupation of Western Sahara and the violation of its people’s rights, or to the upholding of the blockade on Gaza. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European blind societies are not satisfied with this proposal. There is, at present, no legal standard for an exception to copyright for cross-border distribution of formats adapted for print-disabled persons.

I called on the European Commission and the Council to adopt a binding Books Without Borders treaty, which would enable the blind and visually impaired to share books published in special formats worldwide.

At present, due to the restrictions imposed to safeguard intellectual property, only 5% of publications may be used in Braille format, large print or audio or electronic format. Blind people, the visually impaired and those with reading difficulties are unable to access a great number of works, and are therefore discriminated against compared to other citizens. I believe that culture is a value that cannot be relegated to the background; in the same way, I firmly believe that reading is a right of all citizens, and that this activity which enriches each of us and our society cannot be precluded for those citizens who are unable to read in the traditional manner. All the more so, I consider that nowadays, technological development and the possibilities which new technologies offer must be made available for the benefit of citizens; it is not possible to invoke arguments of an economic nature or regarding the defence of intellectual property in order to run counter to the fundamental rights of citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be able to lift the latest novel or political biography is something many of us take for granted. Yet, at present, over 95% of published books are not available in accessible formats for visually impaired and print-disabled persons in Europe. In the rest of the world, over 99% of reading material is unavailable for tens of millions visually disabled persons. Despite the vast improvements in print technology in recent years, little progress has been made towards increasing access to books for the visually impaired. A major obstacle to this is the rigid copyright laws that apply to so many titles. Therefore, I would wholeheartedly support an international Treaty at the World Intellectual Property Organisation to establish an international exception and limitation to copyright to facilitate the cross-border movement of reading material formatted for the blind and visually impaired. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is considering an international treaty to improve access to books for blind and visually impaired people. EU representatives have consistently opposed a legally binding text, giving priority to non-binding recommendations. In its report on ‘Unlocking the potential of the cultural and creative industries’, the European Parliament called on the EU to draw up a binding WIPO treaty. The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, in particular, Articles 21 and 30, and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights establish the principles applicable to the prohibition of discrimination against persons with disabilities.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) evaluated the surveys carried out in these countries. These figures indicated that the number of those suffering visual impairment in these countries has risen by 80%. It is assumed that the figures for the remaining EU Member States will be in line with this trend. The reason given for this is the ageing population. This makes it all the more important to afford people with visual impairment greater unrestricted access to literature, for example. To date, only 5% of published printed works are available in Braille, large print or audio formats.

Due to the inflexible rules on the protection of intellectual property rights, people with such a disability have somewhat limited access to culture, education and an active public life. The publication of books for readers with specific needs basically depends on the goodwill of the copyright holder. In Lithuania alone, there are about 7 000 people with severe visual impairment. The goal of the European disability strategy 2010-2020 is for people with disabilities to be able to participate in all areas of daily life throughout the EU, and for an inclusive and high-quality education policy to be developed. It is essential, therefore, to remedy the situation and to ensure that we provide for appropriate relaxations in the requirements regarding intellectual property rights and exceptions that would not only facilitate, but encourage the publishing of books for people who are blind, visually impaired and dyslexic. I believe that the EU, which has set itself some ambitious goals in the strategy, should not satisfy itself with merely recommendatory decisions, but should go that extra step and ensure the adoption of an agreement within the framework of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which is binding throughout the EU and beyond its borders. I therefore voted in favour of this resolution inviting the Council and the Commission to favour a binding treaty within the framework of the WIPO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of titles available in an adapted format remains woefully inadequate, because 95% of all published works are never converted into ‘accessible formats’ – audio books, large print or Braille – largely for reasons relating to copyright. However, restriction of free access to publications has important consequences, both cultural and social. It also lessens the likelihood of empowerment and independence for the visually impaired. Since non-binding recommendations were not enough (while individual national exceptions may exist, these stop at the borders), it is time to consider exceptions or limitations to copyright rules for cross-border distribution of formats adapted for print-disabled persons. With this in mind, we must urge the Council and the Commission to vote in favour of a legally binding WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation) treaty to approve access to adapted products.

Approximately 15 000 blind people live in Lithuania. The majority of them are isolated, cannot find work or even go shopping without the help of others. The situation for deafblind people is even more complex. They represent one of the most socially isolated groups in Lithuania and Europe. There are at least 150 000 deafblind people in the EU. The exact number of such people in Lithuania is not known because this disability is not officially recognised in my country. Likewise, there is no programme to give deafblind people the best possible assistance. In addition, there is no training for professional people to assess the needs of deafblind people, or for interpreters to help them. Deafblind people in Lithuania do not have the right to the assistance they need for work, or to receive daily specialist social care. It is important for deafblindness to be recognised as a separate form of disability because services that are adapted for people who are deaf or blind are not suitable for deafblind people. I also believe that deafblind children should have the right to an education either in a primary or a special school, depending on the needs of the individual. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has always sought to encourage trade integration on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, since international trade could foster economic growth and reduce poverty. Following the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, this integration is even more important and is an essential factor in consolidating the emerging democracies in these countries. It will also enable a series of around 100 trade agreements to be brought together and will facilitate North-South trade. It will also prevent imports originating from the Israeli settlements occupying Palestinian territory, which cannot benefit from preferential rules.

The first step towards achieving this target was the association agreements between the EU and its Mediterranean partners. The new agreement on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin unites the different rules on the origin of goods that are traded within the framework of the relevant trade agreements concluded between the following states: the EU and the countries participating in the Barcelona Process (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority), the EFTA countries (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein), the Faroe Islands and the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Kosovo, under UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99). The adoption of a single simplified instrument will facilitate a pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin.

This document replaces regulations that have been in force until now, particularly in more than 100 bilateral agreements. While the convention represents an incentive for trade between these countries and reduces the obstacles to the system of international trade, it is also true that its broad scope means that it could run into several problems of international law: given, for example, that Israel is a state party to the new convention, there is a need to set out Palestine’s status in the context of this agreement.

One of the items that I consider key in this motion for a resolution is the need to establish clear criteria regarding preferential rules of origin, so that no product originating in the illegally occupied Palestinian territories will benefit from this rule. I agree with the Commission proposal to create a list of settlements to be sent to all the customs authorities in the Member States, so that each can take the necessary measures, thus ensuring that no product originating from the settlements will benefit from preferential cumulative measures.

I welcome this step towards greater Euro-Mediterranean integration and I hope that it will be possible, in future, for it to include initiatives of a social and cultural nature, as well as those in the economic sphere, which are so important and necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a convention that will not only facilitate pan-Euro-Mediterranean trade rules, but will also be a catalyst for the creation of a common market between the Member States of the European Union and the countries of the southern Mediterranean. The EU has always sought to encourage trade integration on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, since international trade could foster economic growth and reduce poverty. Following the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, this integration is even more important and is an essential factor in consolidating the emerging democracies in these countries. It will also enable a series of around 100 trade agreements to be brought together and will facilitate North-South trade. It will also prevent imports originating from the Israeli settlements illegally occupying Palestinian territory, which cannot benefit from preferential rules. I voted for this proposal because, as the Commissioner said, in addition to constituting the first response to the Arab Spring, this convention will enable the integration of the pan-Mediterranean area with EU trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development of effective cooperation between the EU and the Mediterranean area requires stimulation of access to funds through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI).

There are frequent disputes in this region relating to the actual country of origin of goods. As the agreement is currently undergoing an overhaul, it would be a positive thing if the EU were to pay closer attention to this problem and sought to add new provisions in relation to the pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin that would efficiently prevent abuses, so that this provision does not run contrary to the EU’s support for the Gaza strip.

However, I believe the text does not go far enough to ensure the equal treatment of all partners. Discrimination persists against Palestine, so it is concluded that the agreements should simply be frozen. Such discrimination is unacceptable for a European Union which claims to give lessons to the whole world in matters of democracy and human rights. I would venture to add that even from a purely liberal point of view, this does not work, because according to their core principles, commercial equality should be the rule. They do not even respect the basis of their own ideology, or rather, they are determining the rules according to the interests at stake, as always. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Failure to guarantee adequate or long-term and stable financing would mean even greater costs over time, citizens would not have equal opportunities to receive appropriate information, the programme would be suspended or even halted, and its data provision would cease. This could ultimately mean that the investments made to date have been fruitless, and Europe will lose its independence and technological advancement in this space infrastructure.

GMES is one of the Union’s two flagship space initiatives and plays a key role from a political, strategic and technological viewpoint for monitoring climate change, preventing environmental disasters, managing emergencies and organising mobility and energy trading. The Commission’s decision to exclude GMES from the multiannual financial framework and the proposal to fund it through intergovernmental agreements is therefore somewhat perplexing. Despite the fact that several governments within the Council have already voted in favour of maintaining the programme, we cannot completely rule out the risk that the opposition of some countries may scupper it, wasting all the efforts and investments made up to date. Furthermore, the exclusion of Parliament from the decision-making process and, therefore, the absence of democratic participation, would be very disappointing. I hope that the Commission will reconsider its position and decide to listen to Parliament’s call to reintroduce GMES into the multiannual financial framework. Personally, I believe that this could be achieved by making use of a public-private partnership in order to maximise the investment of the Community budget, as was done for the SESAR project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The GMES programme was implemented to observe the planet Earth; that is, to monitor developments in terms of climate change and deforestation, of measuring greenhouse gas emissions, of environmental sustainability, of civil protection and security, and of economic opportunities that could result from research, development and innovation. I admit to fearing intergovernmental funding for the GMES post-2013, as advocated by the Commission. This is not just doubtful in terms of the EU’s genuine interest in the programme, but could also potentially be a step backwards towards a programme that will need to be more European in scale and which will have shortcomings with regard to transparency, and to full, open and equal access for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree that there is a need to call on the Commission to table a legislative proposal that counters all the aforementioned problems; that is, to announce management and funding supported by the multiannual financial framework and a road map to the GMES being operational, thereby ensuring that it is safely and adequately implemented and that it is fully operational from 2014. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an instrument that, in addition to enabling the observation of the planet Earth, is also key to combating climate change, to civil protection and security, to crisis management, and to sustainable economic development. However, the present budgetary restrictions have led the European Commission to withdraw its funding from the multiannual financial framework (MFF) from 2013: it now comes under the heading of intergovernmental funding. This new funding system does not fully guarantee the programme’s continuity, preventing it from being operational or making it less so. I therefore voted for this proposal so that the Commission will table a legislative proposal to secure its long-term funding, specifically within the MFF, so that the GMES will remain fully operational and that the roles for which it was created will be carried out from 2014. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This an unbelievable proposal which jeopardises the future of a promising sector. Parliament has not failed to point this out, in resolutions of 19 January and 16 February, as have many Member States including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. GMES is a major future-oriented programme but the Commission believes the Union lacks the means to support programmes of this size. However, GMES is highly symbolic. It embodies the commitment of Member States to jointly invest in a European project. What impact would it have on employment and competition if this project were excluded from the Community budget? What impact would it have on the launch of Sentinel satellites planned from 2013 onwards? What impact would it have on our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which could not invest without the certainty of having access to GMES data? What impact would it have on the EU’s international standing? All these issues call for ambitious actions, not half measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, it provides a powerful framework to stimulate innovation.

In September 2011, some of us warned the Commission of the dangers of such a decision. Our main arguments have been reproduced in this resolution: the risk of making financial aid unstable, the loss of its European dimension and the investments already made, the creation of disparities of access to the information and benefits of this programme, etc. Therefore, I signed this resolution to demand the reintegration of GMES into the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 because it is unacceptable to jeopardise in this way such an important programme, already considered to be one of the European Union’s two flagship space initiatives, along with Galileo, and even more so once it starts to bear fruit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EP regrets the fact that on 30 November 2011, the Commission published only a communication and did not come forward with a legislative proposal on GMES, given that the current Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 covers only initial operations and will expire by the end of 2013; it also disagrees with the direction that the Commission indicated in its communication as regards the future financing and government of GMES, the aim being intergovernmental funding of the project; and it is concerned that this direction will be hugely detrimental to the future development of the programme, causing it to lose its European dimension, contradict the principles of transparency and full, open and equal access for all, and be seen as a sign of disengagement by the EU from this flagship initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been discussing the funding of this rather controversial programme for some time in the Committee on Budgets.

The services resulting from this programme are of enormous economic, social and technological importance. It is therefore regrettable that the Commission is not tabling a strategic plan that includes funding and upcoming actions, so as to not allow a project of this value to collapse. This motion for a resolution, for which I voted, calls for the creation of an EU-level institutional framework for the GMES post-2013. The proposal for intergovernmental funding could jeopardise its development and implementation. I therefore consider it relevant that the GMES should be included in the multiannual financial framework, since there is a need to demonstrate that this programme and its services are commercially viable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this regard, we urge the Commission to table a legislative proposal for the management, financing and long term operation of the GMES programme, financed under the MFF, in order to ensure proper implementation of the programme and to achieve its objective of being fully functional as of 2014. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
