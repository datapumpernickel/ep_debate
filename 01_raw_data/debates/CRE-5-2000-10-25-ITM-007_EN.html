<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cushnahan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, Hong Kong went to the polls in September, for the second time since the former British colony was returned to Chinese rule. Analysis of the results reveals disturbing trends which demonstrate that all is not well. Voter turn-out dropped to 43% compared to 53% in 1998 and support for the region's pro-Beijing parties increased in marked contrast to the decline in support for the pro-democracy parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are a number of reasons why Hong Kong voters have opted for apathy instead of exercising their newly established right to vote. The main problem is that while the election procedure itself is free and transparent it can hardly be described as truly democratic. Twenty-four of the 60 seats are directly elected on the basis of universal suffrage, where three million Hong Kong citizens have the right to vote. The remaining 36 seats are returned by a mere 179 000 electors drawn from Hong Kong's powerful business and professional interests as well as pro-Beijing groups. Furthermore the legislature has little real power. The real power rests with the Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa and his government which, in effect, is appointed by Beijing. The executive is totally separate from the legislature, which is left to operate more like a watchdog rather than a real decision-making body. The legislature's lack of real power has made voters unenthusiastic about participating in elections which, in their view, are not truly democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Basic Law – which is Hong Kong's mini-constitution – lays down specific criteria for the holding of the 2004 election, it does nonetheless provide for the possible introduction of universal suffrage for the election of all 60 seats for the 2008 election. However, such a step is resisted by some who clearly wish to protect the power of big business. Even if universal suffrage were to be introduced – preferably sooner rather than later – it would not solve all the current problems. It would need to be accompanied by a reform to the Special Administrative Region's political institutions. The executive has no party base in the legislature, which means that these two institutions are effectively completely separate from one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, because the executive is not really accountable to the elected representatives and because the latter lack real power, they are also not held accountable for their own political pronouncements and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration must be given to changing the respective rules of the executive and the legislature to ensure an operational inter-relationship. Other matters need to be examined. They could include the method of appointment of principal officials: should they be political appointments or civil servants, and how they should be held accountable by elected representatives?</p>
<p class="contents">As well as problems in this area there is also growing concern regarding increasing Chinese interference in Hong Kong's affairs. The rule of law is the cornerstone of the "one country, two systems" policy. Three recent, controversial legal cases have far-reaching implications for the integrity of the rule of law and ultimately for the autonomy of Hong Kong itself. Two of these resulted in the execution of individuals for crimes they had committed in Hong Kong, where capital punishment is banned. The third case related to a judgment handed down by Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal on a controversial immigration law concerning residency rights in Hong Kong for children of Chinese parents who themselves had resident status in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Government was displeased with the liberal judgment and invited the Chinese authorities to reinterpret the Basic Law. Many observers consider that this has created a worrying precedent, which appears to enable China to issue interpretations of the Basic Law whenever local courts make decisions of which either the Hong Kong Government or mainland politicians disapprove.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation was further compounded by mainland officials trying to interfere in press freedom and Hong Kong's trading relationship with Taiwan, following the recent Taiwanese election.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards my comments on the dominance of the Li Ka-shing family – which was the subject of much media interest in Hong Kong today – in some sectors of Hong Kong's economy, I should like to point out that the reason I have raised this matter is that it has been raised with me by leading figures in Hong Kong and indeed was the subject of major media debate during a recent visit there by myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to raise the question of visa-free access. I am very unhappy that this has been blocked by some governments. If we really believe in the "one country, two systems" approach then this is the one way of underpinning it. Visa-free access should be given to Hong Kong's passport-holders without any preconditions.</p>
<p class="contents">So far I have concentrated on the negative aspects. While these events give cause for concern I would not be unduly pessimistic regarding Hong Kong's future. The "one country, two systems" remains reasonably intact, but, the real problem is that if the "one country, two systems" is seen to fail then the China-Taiwan problem will be even more difficult to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should like to thank all those who were involved in the deliberations on this report: my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and members of the Foreign Affairs Secretariat, especially Mrs Opacic, and the Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Back in 1997, Hong Kong was ranked eighth in the list of major world trading powers and tenth in the list of European Union trading partners. Since then, and despite the Asian financial crisis, trade relations between the European Union and Hong Kong have gone from strength to strength.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as relations between Hong Kong and its international trading partners are concerned, more specifically the World Trade Organisation, the EU and Hong Kong share a number of common goals and the two work very closely together, which is useful in the light of the forthcoming trade round.</p>
<p class="contents">In my recommendation, I referred to the important role which Hong Kong could play when China joined the World Trade Organisation. Hong Kong could show China how an open, fully integrated market can play a leading role in the region and can in this way achieve economic development and sustained growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, since Hong Kong constitutes a major sales market for China, Hong Kong can exercise influence on economic reform in China. For these reasons, we must stress the importance of closer cooperation between the European Union and Hong Kong in financial terms and in terms of trade and direct foreign investments.</p>
<p class="contents">Hong Kong has concluded many bilateral agreements over the past few years. We should bear in mind that in the framework of the EU-China agreement with regard to the possible accession of China to the World Trade Organisation, these bilateral agreements will need to be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, economically speaking, we are right to term the relationship with Hong Kong a success, I should highlight a number of drawbacks, including the fact that the protection of intellectual property rights remains a huge problem. Our companies are still being faced with violations of copyright and the manufacture and sale of counterfeit products.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have concerns in the social field. After all, working conditions reportedly leave a great deal to be desired, especially vis-à-vis immigrant workers. As far as the inquiry is concerned, we must call for both Hong Kong and the European Union to play a valuable role in the many projects which are in the pipeline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted to see that Commissioner Patten, for whose attitude and efficiency as governor of Hong Kong I have a great deal of respect, is here with us today. I should like to dwell for a moment on two points which I believe are important, as of course are so many others. The first is purely legal. We must, I think, all agree that if, with measures such as those quoted in the Cushnahan report, we touch on the principle of the rule of law which should inform the legal and constitutional framework of Hong Kong, then we question the wider principle of "one country, two systems" on which developments in Hong Kong have been based. And the second point which I wish to raise concerns the risks threatening the freedom of the press. It is of paramount importance to the proper development of the principle of "one country, two systems", which constituted a revolution, as it were, in international relations because it introduced a new doctrine, to have, to protect and to respect freedom of the press. Why? Because it is through freedom of the press that observations and proposals are made which aim to keep things within the democratic framework on which we are all agreed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Cushnahan on his report. I should like to thank him for once again being so adaptable in writing that report and being prepared to involve his colleagues so that there is no need for us to go through a lengthy amendment procedure because we reached consensus when the report was being drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again we see the handover of power in Hong Kong has generally gone very well and has defeated some of the more pessimistic forecasts. Clearly, demonstrations still take place on a weekly basis in Hong Kong, movements are permitted in Hong Kong which are not permitted in China, the economy has survived a difficult period and continues to thrive and, as Mr De Clercq has said, the WTO membership for China should actually be an opportunity for Hong Kong, given its tremendous power in financial services in particular, and given that much of Hong Kong manufacturing has already moved to China.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as Mr Cushnahan has pointed out, there are areas of concern and they are set out well in his report so I do not need to go through them. But I may quote one or two examples. The Chinese news agency telling Mrs Anson Chan and the civil servants they had to better support the Chief Executive seems to me like interference in the affairs of another country. The various reports of businessmen being put under pressure not to trade with Taiwan is also cause for concern. The recent sacking or movement of one of the directors of Radio Television Hong Kong appears to have been as a result of pressure from the mainland.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these things in themselves may not add up to a great deal because they are part of a normal power struggle that you would see, provided, that is, that what Hong Kong was based on was a thriving, democratic system that could resist those sorts of pressures. But we have to be concerned that in Hong Kong democracy is not going the way that we would have liked. We have already heard of the unfair nature of the election system.</p>
<p class="contents">We will note, as was pointed out recently in the <span class="italic">Financial Times </span>by an adviser to the former Governor, the extent to which the rules were pushed back in 1997. But when you see someone like Christine Loh resigning because there is no point in being in the legislative any more that, to me, is a significant signal that things are not going well. And when someone who works for the Chief Executive is accused of interfering in opinion polls, that also bodes ill for the future. It is not just a question of point scoring, a lot of modernisation is needed in Hong Kong. That will only come about if there is a consensus and the top-down government in Hong Kong at the moment is ill-equipped to build consensus within Hong Kong. While we recognise there has been a smooth transition, there remain areas we have to watch. I would hope that we can continue with these annual reports and these Parliament reports so that we can monitor very closely the situation in Hong Kong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I envy him the opportunity of having been able to draw it up</p>
<p class="contents">If I take issue with anything in this report, it is purely on a matter of balance and perspective. It is a question of whether one regards the glass as being half full, or as being half empty. Mr Cushnahan rightly points to the question of the three legal cases which have caused concern. He rightly points to the lack of progress on the introduction of universal suffrage for the elections of the Chief Executive, to discrimination against companies with trading links with Taiwan and to the decline in confidence of the political system. These are all indeed serious challenges and if we must be grateful that things have gone as well as they have, we must nonetheless be concerned that greater progress has not been made.</p>
<p class="contents">If we believe, as I do, that the biggest challenge of the 21st century is the democratisation of China, then of course Hong Kong is a fascinating experiment. I should be interested if the Commissioner would report to us something of the summit that Mr Prodi had with the Chinese last weekend and whether Hong Kong came up in those discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy and the rule of law will not be achieved and sustained unless the West is determined to make its voice heard. I believe that the record of the European Union falls far behind that of the United States of America in this area. I am aware that our Member States have concerns about standing up against the Chinese on issues of human rights because they fear trade sanctions in retaliation. But if there is one area where western Europe could stand four-square behind the European banner, it is surely in this area. We must have a record on human rights which is as good as that of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The ASEM summit last week managed to agree a statement which included as a goal of Asia-Europe cooperation the promotion of human rights. That is progress but we must look to the Commission for much more active involvement in this area; the fruits of such an approach will be enjoyed nowhere more than in Hong Kong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, our group has read the report by Mr Cushnahan with approval and due appreciation. In addition to overall satisfaction with regard to the functioning of the ‘one country, two systems’ policy, we too call for permanent vigilance which is in order following the worrying incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We are the first to express our anxiety with regard to the Hong Kong government’s decision to apply for an interpretation of the 1990 Basic Law from the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. The veto right which China could obtain as a result of this with regard to court rulings in Hong Kong puts a question mark over the legal autonomy of the Special Administrative Region.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more worrying because the Hong Kong Government is not based on a democratically elected majority. The elections for the Legislative Council a month ago were once again proof of the democratic deficit. The electorate displayed their contempt for the system, in which only 24 of the 60 seats were filled by directly elected members. This partly explains the disappointing turn-out of 43.6%. The fact that an electoral college of 800 members subsequently decided on the occupation of six seats and the fact that only 175 000 businesspeople were entitled to elect the other half of parliament turned the elections into a complete farce. In this way, not only is the chasm between rich and poor sustained, it is also widened. We therefore opted for the swift introduction of direct elections by no later than 2008, at which time there will no longer be any legal restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would call for permanent vigilance with regard to the freedom of press, the need for laws with regard to fair competition and the possibility of an open trade relationship with Hong Kong and Taiwan. On that basis, we would recommend a stimulating trade policy vis-à-vis Hong Kong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I am delighted to be able to comment on this report and to commend the excellent work done by my honourable friend, John Cushnahan. He and I are old friends and, more importantly, old friends of Hong Kong. Both of us speak with – what I could describe with an understatement as – a degree of knowledge of that remarkable community.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a short debate, but we have heard some excellent and well-informed speeches. I was grateful for the kind things that the honourable gentleman, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, said about my time in Hong Kong. I agree with him about the importance of the freedom of speech and a vigorous media and, judging by my experiences last week, the media does remain – at least the written media – extremely vigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable gentleman, Mr Watson, referred to the fact that we should not feel inhibited in what we say about Hong Kong or about other issues by our trading relationship with China. I am always surprised when people put the contrary point of view, not least because on the most recent figures, China had a EUR 30 billion trade surplus with the European Union. In the first six months of this year, the surplus was EUR 20 billion and looks like becoming EUR 40 billion for the whole year, so one needs to keep questions of trade in perspective, to put it very gently.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a happy coincidence that the debate is taking place today, since I was in Hong Kong last week. It was my third visit since I relinquished the post of governor and my first full working visit as a Commissioner. I can report first hand to the House that while, as several honourable gentlemen have pointed out, some problems exist, Hong Kong nevertheless remains a free society, undoubtedly one of the freest societies in Asia as both the Commission and Parliament's annual reports make clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The secret of Hong Kong's great success has always been its fusion of Hong Kong-Chinese entrepreneurial culture with the attributes of a free and open society founded on the rule of law. The concept of one country, two systems enshrined in the joint declaration is designed to maintain that special mix – a mix between independent judiciary, clean civil service, zero tolerance of corruption, free press on the one hand and market economics on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As both our reports make clear, so far, on the whole, it is managing to maintain the mix and I share the view in the honourable gentleman's report that the fundamentals of the arrangement remain reasonably intact.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that Hong Kong has been through a momentous few years. Not only has it had to endure the transfer of sovereignty, no sooner did the flags change than Hong Kong – like the rest of Asia – was hit by the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a considerable tribute to the strength and resilience of people in Hong Kong that they have taken these tumultuous events in their stride. It does not surprise me entirely, they are many of them former refugees or the sons and daughters of refugees and they are used to handling and overcoming adversity. I am delighted that the Hong Kong economy is now bouncing back very strongly after a difficult couple of years. Part of the reason for that is thanks to the excellent stewardship by Hong Kong's superb civil service, not least its chief secretary and financial secretary who served Tung Chee Hwa with the same skill and dedication with which they served me. Hong Kong has an outstanding civil service and it would have been nice if that had been the thrust of the Xinhwa report which the honourable gentleman referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">For the most part, things have gone well but naturally there have been areas which have given rise to concern on the part of Hong Kong's many friends. Both reports address these directly. In particular, both reports mention the judgments in the right of abode case earlier this year. That was an important matter. We have emphasised and will continue to stress that the way in which this matter was handled, in particular the involvement of Beijing should remain wholly exceptional.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been other issues too, including the recent controversy involving academic freedom and the even more recent one involving the Public Order Ordinance, where the provisional legislature replaced the more liberal arrangement that my administration bequeathed with something rather less liberal. I make no comment on that but I find it reassuring that Hong Kong public opinion continues to make clear that it takes its freedoms and rights very seriously. That goes for the media as well, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The long-term success of one country, two systems was always going to depend on the willingness of Hong Kong people to stand up for their rights and liberties; so far they have shown every sign of being determined to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">There are one or two specific issues in our bilateral relationship to which both reports refer. One is visa-free access to the European Union for Hong Kong SAR passport holders and the same issues apply equally for Macao. Both the Commission and the honourable gentleman's report support visa-free access. It was an issue that came up several times in my visit last week. I made clear then – as I make clear today – that I strongly support visa-free access. There are concerns on the part of some Member States. These concerns are profoundly misplaced. They stem from worries about illegal immigration from mainland China, not from the special administrative regions of Hong Kong or Macao. We remain wholly satisfied with the integrity of the border controls in place and with the integrity of SAR passport issuing procedures. The Council's visa working group which inspected the system was, I believe, impressed. I hope that we will be willing to grant visa-free access.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope too that we will be able to reinforce a flourishing economic relationship with Hong Kong, with strengthened cooperation in other areas, such as education and the environment. We will aim to promote the use of the European Communities' existing instruments in Hong Kong, such as participation in the Fifth Framework Programme on research, as the honourable gentleman's report recommends. There are a number of further recommendations in the report which my officials will be studying closely.</p>
<p class="contents">If I can just say one word about intellectual piracy, to which the honourable gentleman, Mr De Clercq, referred; it has been a problem for years. My administration took much more vigorous measures to deal with it. The present administration is taking particularly vigorous measures to deal with it, under the new director of the customs service whom I happen to know rather well because he was my private secretary for a number of years. Everybody has been impressed by the leadership that he has shown in tackling what is undoubtedly a serious problem for industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, we strongly endorse the view in the Parliament that this monitoring – your monitoring and our monitoring – is valuable and that it should continue. We do not seek to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs, but the international community and the European Union in particular have a considerable stake in Hong Kong and its continuing rights and freedoms are embodied in a treaty lodged at the United Nations. We will continue to maintain our interest in Hong Kong. It is a community which inspired admiration the world over for its achievements and which, much to the satisfaction of its last governor, continues to do so.</p>
