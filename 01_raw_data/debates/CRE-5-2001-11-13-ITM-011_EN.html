<p class="contents">According to the latest annual report of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, opium production in Afghanistan has fallen strikingly as a result of the Taliban's prohibition policy. From being the world's leading exporter, the country now accounts for only 10% of world trade in opium. The events of 11 September have also contributed to the disruption of farming, including the cultivation of opium.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this situation and the desperate plight of the population, what practical initiatives can the Commission take, particularly through its participation in the UN anti-drug programme, to provide relief and aid to the communities affected, and to dissuade producers from reverting to opium growing or selling the stocks that they still have? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The significant assistance which the Community had been giving to the Afghan population has increased recently.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community finances actions in the following areas: emergency aid, aid to displaced persons, aid for food safety, human rights and landmines. The assistance is implemented speedily through a wide network of non-governmental organisations. In this way, we contribute to reducing the dependence on poppy cultivation of the people who receive this aid. The food safety programme is of particular importance, since it provides seeds, tools and all the necessary elements for alternative crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, no donor has been able to offer assistance in the field of compliance with the law in order to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan, owing to the government of that country. However, the Commission has supported programmes in this sector, in countries which play an essential role in the heroin trafficking routes towards the European Union, such as the States of Central Asia: Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, the Ukraine, Moldavia, Belarus, Bulgaria and Rumania.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still unknown whether, given the current changing situation, the significant reduction in poppy cultivation observed by the UNIDCP 2000/2001 will continue and, furthermore, according to the United Nations, the trafficking in refined heroin from Afghanistan does not appear to be diminishing. According to the estimates of this United Nations body, the stocks accumulated before the crisis would keep the European market supplied for the next three to four years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because it is clear that the aid, which has been interrupted since 11 September for obvious reasons, is going to be renewed as soon as possible. And I hope that on this occasion it is not restricted solely to funding and supported activity in the rural field, in the alternative crop sector, but that it also allows us to cooperate and maintain greater supervision of the real effectiveness of the authorities in their fight against this type of crop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, it is clear that the best way to reduce the threat posed to nuclear installations, or any other installation, by the possibility of terrorists deliberately crashing an aircraft into them, is to make it impossible, or extremely improbable, that they may hijack a large commercial aircraft in the first place.</p>

We all know that nuclear power plants were not designed to withstand collisions with large aircraft, particularly jumbo jets. You say that it is not that easy to hi-jack an airplane. Only yesterday there was another terrible accident in New York. I hope it was an accident and not an act of terror: at this point in time it is not entirely clear. Let us all pray that it was merely an accident and not something that was designed to kill all the people on board. I am sure we all sympathise with the families.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very serious matter. All I am asking is, will the Commission prepare an analysis? Surely you can say "yes" to that and not just pass it off as the responsibility of the Member States. You have powers under Articles 34 and 35 of the Euratom Treaty. According to a recent European Parliament study you are not exercising your powers under those articles. Could you please comment on that aspect of my question. Have you looked at that study?

<p class="contents">I would like to say that nuclear power stations are not designed to endure the impact of a large commercial aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that not all the nuclear power stations in the European Union are the same; those which have a second layer of protection and, specifically, the most recent ones built in Germany, perhaps have a greater capacity for resistance and better security in the face of this type of situation than others.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would insist that security, in both its forms – security against terrorist attacks, external agents or sabotage and security against possible accidents – is a national responsibility. Having said all this, the honourable Member is right and we are concerned about these issues, especially in view of enlargement and the achievement of security levels in the nuclear power stations in the countries which are going to join the European Union in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are studying how far we can go within the Euratom Treaty, in order to incorporate and seek equivalent levels of security within the nuclear installations in the current Member States, but, I would insist, within the margins laid down in the Treaties. Like you, I believe it is necessary to guarantee the greatest possible level of security.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not only talk about nuclear power stations. The great petro-chemical plants, the great chemical industries, the great dams, are other installations which are at considerable risk and unfortunately may cause significant disasters in the case of a certain type of attack or sabotage. Various countries are working on this, not just those of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, at the moment the WENRA, where all the regulators of the different Member States of the European Union meet, is working to find equivalent security standards which, in my opinion (which is shared by the services, although it is not an official position of the Commission, and I am therefore speaking personally), are necessary and beneficial for all: for the States which have chosen the non-nuclear option, but also for everyone else, since I believe, like you, that if there is an accident in a nuclear power station, the repercussions will transcend administrative borders and the problem is pan-European or even global. We must therefore support the Vienna Commission, which depends on the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">These equivalent security standards should therefore be established, with a degree of obligation which is similar to that demanded in the Community, which would offer greater safeguards for the whole world.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Serious unwanted side effects following the consumption of energy drinks in the European Union</span></p>
<p class="contents">In several Member States of the European Union (including Ireland and Sweden) a number of serious cases have been recorded in which the consumption of energy drinks such as Red Bull has led to unwanted side effects and, in a number of cases, proved fatal. These drinks, when consumed in combination with alcohol or coffee or after vigorous physical exercise, cause complications chiefly manifested in the central nervous system. Moreover, such beverages are freely available in places such as schools, gymnasiums and discotheques.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will be taken following the deliberations of the 84th meeting of the Standing Committee on Food at which the Member State representatives expressed deep concern? Is it acceptable to treat as a normal beverage a product whose consumption is restricted in respect of so many sectors of the population (including children, pregnant women, mothers who are breast feeding, the elderly and those suffering from high blood pressure) and which is subject to general restrictions to the effect that it should not be mixed with alcohol or coffee or taken after intense physical exercise? What procedures are followed for the approval of such products? Does the Commission not consider that the above factors are sufficient to justify withdrawal of this product from the market as a precautionary measure until it has been proven that it is not harmful to health? </p>

<p class="contents">As noted, two Member States have reported deaths in their countries associated with the consumption of those products. In neither case, however, was there any evidence that the consumption of energy drinks was the cause of death. Both Member States have commissioned their own research, investigating the available data on the effect of these drinks on health. Recently another Member State produced a list of incidents linked to the consumption of such products, but without any substantiating evidence. None of the Member States concerned took any steps to restrict or prohibit energy drinks in their own territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Standing Committee noted a need for further information on the potential effects on health of ingredients in the products and the Scientific Committee for Food is examining data submitted by a manufacturer of such products regarding the safety of one of the products in question.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information, further studies are nearing completion. At the above mentioned meeting of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, the Commission repeated its request to Member States to submit information on the safety of products on their markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands the concerns that have been expressed and it therefore intends to work with Member States to look at the issue in depth and identify the appropriate course of action to ensure a high level of protection for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">So-called energy drinks are not covered by any specific legislation and are not subject to an approval procedure at Community level.

<p class="contents">My first task concerns the application of the decisions made by the ‘Television without frontiers’ directive. For example, Article 16 restricts advertising aimed at children, as minors must be protected. Obviously, we cannot do just anything in programmes intended for children. However, I would like Parliament to help me out a bit, for example with regard to this point. Can we make just any old film for children? What sometimes shocks me just as much as certain adverts is the violence in films specifically intended for children. We are analysing all that in order to find, together, the most effective way of making progress in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of digital television, which will enable hundreds of programmes, including children’s programmes, to be broadcast, I would like us, in Europe, to have a high enough budget, sufficient investments to produce good children’s programmes. This is my second task: ensuring that, in future, we have enough children’s films suitable for that age, films that are positive and are both educational and imaginative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Television, therefore, is often subject to far more stringent regulations than those applicable to the other media, which are not always subject to specific rules concerning minors.

<p class="contents">Many differences may be noted at Member State level as well, ranging from the age limits set, which differ significantly from one country to another, to the specific provisions governing certain sectors, such as financial activities and drinks advertising.

This is a perfectly worthy city, which also offers many advantages. It must be said that, amongst the candidate cities, there were also perfectly worthy European cities that also offered numerous advantages for hosting the headquarters of this agency. What happened was that the European countries did not show sufficient coordination and the fact that so many European cities were put forward certainly favoured the choice of Montreal. I wish to make it quite clear that the Belgian presidency cannot be held responsible for this failure. It did make considerable efforts to overcome the problems, unfortunately, however, without success. Europe put forward several candidates, whereas other countries put forward only one, and it was this approach that won the day over the plethora of European candidates. I must repeat the fact that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Community, but rather within that of the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">We must now apply to the future the lessons we have learned from the Tallinn meeting. The first lesson should be that of the European Union’s cohesion. Furthermore, yesterday, the Fifteen’s Ministers for Sport met in Brussels for an informal Council, and cohesion was one of the main items discussed there. The ministers agreed to join forces and adopt the same approach to combat the scourge that is doping, firstly at world level, in other words, to step up their action within the World Anti-Doping Agency and, secondly, at European level, where there are good grounds for putting a concerted anti-doping programme into action. There are good grounds because Europe is the most advanced continent in the fight against doping, the greatest number of world-class sporting events takes place here and because Europe has the greatest number of competitions between clubs of different sporting disciplines. Furthermore, we have the greatest number of accredited laboratories and we must continue to bring our knowledge to bear in the fight against doping at world level. Yesterday, I informed the ministers that a Community plan is being drafted and they gave me the green light to put this into action. I shall now begin consultations on the aspects to be included in this action plan and in 2002, we shall have the opportunity to discuss it properly. I should also like to say that, in order to improve this European cohesion, which must apply not only to the fifteen governments, but must also exist between governments and sports federations, at the beginning of the Spanish presidency, a meeting will be held between the fifteen Ministers for Sports and the European sports federations to decide on the best approach to adopt in order to combat doping.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have accepted this division. It appears that of the part falling to national governments, 47.5% will be covered by the European Union. This is a considerable proportion, but it is also proof of our sporting prowess on this continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I am sure you are fully aware, Mrs Zabell, that we have interinstitutional rules governing payments made from the budget. These interinstitutional rules force us to adhere to certain procedures, in order to ensure that taxpayers’ money is used scrupulously.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency do not currently match the very strict rules that apply in the European Union. This is why Europe has asked the WADA to change its internal rules so that there is, first of all, a serious budget, a budget that is forecast over several years. Secondly, there would need to be an internal rule ensuring that the other continents cannot impose a budget on the European Union but instead that we have a right of veto, and a right to examine proposals. Thirdly, this 47.5% funding must also be matched by appropriate representation on the WADA’s board of management. Once these three conditions are met, they will enable us to launch the process of the Council and the European Parliament taking a decision on funding the WADA.</p>
<p class="contents">For the moment, and until 3 December, when the World Anti-Doping Agency meets, the ball is in the Agency’s court. Once the Agency has met the basic conditions enabling us to set the budgetary process in motion, however, the Commission will submit a proposal and the ball will then be in the court of the Member States and Parliament to implement this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, with regard to the year 2002 which is rapidly approaching, I would ask governments to shoulder their responsibilities. They stated very clearly yesterday, in Brussels, that they are willing to do so. It is therefore, up to the Council of Ministers to arrange these payments for 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, moreover, one of the reasons why I have been so committed to the European Year of Languages 2001. Something I did not realise at the beginning, when I launched this plan, was that there would be such enthusiasm, in all our Member States, about the linguistic phenomenon. All sorts of organisations have lobbied, local councils have discussed language education, in short, there has been huge enthusiasm in all our Member States and this enthusiasm has also made itself felt at government level. Some governments have adopted measures to give language learning greater priority in their curricula with effect from the 2001-2002 school year. I shall be attending the Education Council on 29 November, and on that occasion we will be discussing the best way to follow up the European Year of Languages, because it is not enough to have launched an action and for that action to have been received with great enthusiasm on the part of the public; this action also needs to be followed up. Let me reassure you that I shall be pursuing this course of action most conscientiously. In concert with the Ministers for Education, I shall be making the frameworks of the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes more open to language teaching than has been the case in the past, and then I shall be presenting a report on the very practical way we have been implementing on the ground, and that is not all, because the year is not yet over and many projects are still underway, the lessons we have learned from the public. In this sense, when I talk about lessons that we have learned from the public, I am thinking of the entire linguistic panoply that we have in Europe, not only the 11 official languages, but also the sixty-odd languages spoken by Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must, however, be pointed out, Mr President, that the Commission cannot set school curricula. This is in the sphere of subsidiarity and, therefore, falls within the remit of the Ministers for Education. This is why I conveyed to the Education Ministers all the discussions that took place in all the institutional frameworks, of which there were many, in order to tell them: ‘Here you are, Europe’s citizens and their representatives want the linguistic element to become an important part of the education system’. On the basis of all the reports available, at the end of November, the Ministers will have to decide and adopt a resolution, and then I shall ensure that this resolution is followed up with deeds, in other words that these ministers will make sure that their national or regional education systems, depending on the country, will provide the greatest possible range of languages, and from as early an age as possible. I cannot, however, force a minister to put a particular language on his or her agenda. I can only encourage him or her to do so.

<p class="contents">In an earlier reply to a written question in 1997, the Commission noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for purposes of torture. However it is not always possible to determine in advance what use such equipment will be put to. Therefore it is not feasible to apply different treatment under these directives to equipment that could potentially be used as an instrument of torture.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, to take account of the concerns of Members of Parliament and many others who have written to me on the issue, the Commission, in particular the External Relations DG, is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or for cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The specific aim of this regulation is to lay down Community rules to prohibit the export, sale and transfer to third countries and the import and purchase from third countries of such equipment. This proposal should also deal, as appropriate, with electrical devices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I tabled the question. The Amnesty International Report, Stopping the Torture Trade (2001), found that electric-shock devices have been used to torture or ill-treat people in prisons, detention centres and police stations in no less than 76 countries around the world. The report also found that stun-gun weapon manufacturers are advertising these products with the 'awarded' CE standard. As Mr MacCormick has said, the CE mark was meant to be a sign of quality and safety, but in a torture weapon it is pretty perverse and sickening.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commissioner's proposal and would welcome further clarification of the timetable. To push things a little bit forward: you have explained how the CE mark is awarded, but how are the recipients of the awards monitored and have any CE marks been withdrawn, to your knowledge? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is there any system of mutual recognition of a ruling by one national authority, or would it be necessary to challenge the use of a CE mark on something like a stun gun separately in each of the 15 Member States?

<p class="contents">This notification, pursuant to Directive 98/34/EC, allows the Commission and other Member States to carry out a prior examination of a measure which might create obstacles to the free movement of goods in the internal market. Several Member States have reacted to the Danish proposal. The Commission for its part has sent the Danish authorities a letter whose effect was to postpone the possibility of adopting the proposal until 6 September 2001. Denmark must reply to the Commission and inform it of the action it intends to take on the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The position expressed by the Commission can be summarised as follows. Firstly, the Commission recognises the legitimacy of the objective of the Danish proposal. The text is aimed at combating greenhouse warming and at contributing towards a 21% reduction of six industrial gases to which Denmark committed itself at the Environment Council in June 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, for its part, undertook under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce by 8% the emissions of the six industrial gases in question produced by all its Member States. In the light of information already provided by Denmark, however, the Commission considers that the proposal is disproportionate to the objective pursued and does not appear, therefore, to comply with the rules of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes that there are technical measures for monitoring these emissions and that those measures create fewer distortions of intra-Community trade than a total prohibition. Moreover, the Commission is not convinced that safe alternative measures which are technically compatible with the systems currently used exist in all cases or will be in existence within deadlines laid down by the Danish proposal. If Denmark does not respond to the Commission's request the latter, as the guardian of the Treaties, may, whilst the proposal has been adopted, initiate infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly the Commission has taken action with regard to this issue.

I hope that the Commission will seek further contact with the Danish authorities over and above the letters they have already sent, to ensure that a reply is received quickly. The amount of uncertainty at the moment with regard to the intentions of the Danish Government is creating ripples across the single market and raising doubts that are not conducive to the progressive restructuring of the air-conditioning market – and the other markets in which these gases are used – so that they can be phased out over an appropriate and sensible period of time.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Swedish ban on cadmium in fertiliser</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this year the Swedish ban on cadmium in fertilisers will expire. The EU derogation will then run out and new arrangements cannot be prepared in time. On its accession in 1995, Sweden was entitled to retain stricter rules than those applying in the EU for various chemicals and dangerous substances for four years. The derogation for the Swedish restrictions on cadmium in fertiliser was extended by three years. This time is up at the end of this year, and no new arrangements will be ready.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the derogation for a limited period was that the EU would, in the mean time, tighten up its rules on dangerous substances. This has been done in some cases, but not in respect of cadmium in fertilisers. Pending common rules the stopgap solution must be to extend the derogation, which applies to Finland and Austria as well as Sweden. But not even that will be possible before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal has yet to be submitted, and it then has to be adopted by the Council and Parliament. This will mean that there will be a period during which high cadmium content fertiliser could theoretically be sold in Sweden.</p>

<p class="contents">This proposal is now in the hands of the Council and Parliament for the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of cadmium in fertilisers has been under study by the Commission for a number of years, originally with the aim of introducing appropriate harmonising legislation before the derogation expires on 31 December 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">However, due to the complexity of the scientific issues involved, and the delays in the risk assessments carried out by the Member States, it was not possible to propose the required legislation at an earlier stage. For this reason, the Commission decided to extend the derogation on cadmium in fertilisers for a further three years and it did so by including the appropriate provisions in a proposal for a regulation recasting the existing fertiliser directives.</p>
<p class="contents">As the major part of the text of the proposed regulation is not new, it is hoped that this proposal will be adopted rapidly, possibly at first reading. The Commission is doing everything possible to facilitate rapid adoption of the regulation. But if it turns out that it is not possible to have the proposed regulation in place before the end of the year, the Member States concerned can ask for a derogation under Article 95(4) of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such policies need to be developed in partnership with the countries of origin and transit, and should also contain initiatives concerning the internal policies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in favour of addressing migration in a comprehensive manner which implies that European Union policies should not only address illegal migration but also include initiatives to serve the socio-economic interests of countries of origin and transit as well as legal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the initiatives that need to be developed in partnership with the Mediterranean partners, it should be mentioned that illegal migration is one of the subjects currently being discussed within the framework of the Barcelona Process. Both sides agree that multilateral efforts are needed to address illegal immigration from North Africa to the European Union. The need to develop such a policy was underlined during the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs held in Brussels on 5-6 November this year. This subject, including a number of concrete proposals on preventing and fighting illegal immigration, is also part of the draft regional programme on justice and home affairs. Partners hope to adopt this programme during the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs to be held on 22-23 April 2002 in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, illegal immigration has been identified as one of the relevant themes for cooperation within the framework of the Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and Morocco. During the Association Council of 9 October this year Morocco underlined its determination to fight illegal migration and the networks of traffickers and called on the European Union for support in its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Moroccan authorities have presented concrete and ambitious proposals which aim to curb illegal migration, primarily by reinforcing the surveillance of Morocco's Atlantic and Mediterranean borders. The Commission is currently studying these proposals and hopes to be in a position to respond to the proposals fairly soon. The Commission has also decided to use the newly-created budget line, aimed at cooperation with third countries in the area of migration, to support financial projects to assist the Moroccan authorities responsible for border control and the fight against illegal immigration by providing training and technical assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem we have today is that every week approximately 100 illegal immigrants are reaching the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. The operation seems to consist of getting hold of a supply ship from somewhere and than putting the immigrants onto small boats which take them to the coast. Some make it, others drown, and the process goes on and on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner’s response is that there is no Community action, but that it is hoped that the neighbouring countries will control immigration. But the fact is that this immigration is taking place. My supplementary question is as follows: a couple of weeks ago, the Mayor of the city of Las Palmas bought 200 one-way air tickets for illegal immigrants who were there and they flew to Madrid. The Mayor of Madrid, who is from the same party, was not very happy. Does the Commissioner believe that, if this immigration continues in this way, this would be the way to proceed, i.e. that the Canarian local authorities should pay for one-way tickets for illegal immigrants, because there is no more space on the islands, or do you believe that there is another possible solution, which would not make this air link for immigrants between the Canaries and the European continent necessary? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the Barcelona process recognised the priority nature of the debate and dialogue on the joint strategy of the European Union and the Mediterranean countries for fighting illegal immigration, which is not an isolated issue, but which must be integrated into the overall negotiation of the socio-economic development of the Maghreb countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco, the Moroccan authorities have sent us very specific proposals to strengthen the control of the Atlantic and Mediterranean borders. And I stress the Atlantic border because, as well as being an innovation in relations between the European Union and Morocco, it is particularly important for the specific situation of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">These are two positive points in the dialogue between the European Union and the countries of this region, and specifically, Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which I believe is new, is that there is no European policy on returning illegal immigrants to countries of origin or transit. Therefore, the Commission intends to present Council and the European Parliament with a communication in the coming weeks on illegal immigration, which includes the issue of creating common standards for the policy on returning illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have this communication, the honourable Member will be able to see the Commission’s ideas and contributions to this debate on the creation of a European policy on returning illegal immigrants, which is currently the exclusive competence of national or regional governments, as in the case of the Government of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lastly, the Republic of Greece has removed any mention of religion on identity cards and its initiative has been approved by the Greek Council of State, which considered that even the optional mention of religion on identity cards contravenes Article 13 of the Greek Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s position with regard to the indication of religion on national identity cards has not changed.

<p class="contents">My second comment is this: I absolutely agree on the sensitivity issue and, anyway, it is the common view in the European Parliament that the argument of religious identity should not be used as a factor which might cause problems if it is included; but I should like to ask if the European Union agrees that schools in the Member States of the European Union should do the same as the madrasses in Islamic countries and teach the view, and we see this on a daily basis, that Muslims should kill Christians and Jews and that this is a part of their religion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask, given that it is prohibited to teach Fascist or Nazi ideas about the annihilation of the Jews, if we can accept, on the contrary, that they be taught by Muslim fundamentalists in the light of the specific circumstances which have arisen following the attack on 11 September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to what I believe is your second question, the content of education provided by schools in Arab countries, if I have understood correctly, I must, of course, tell you that the Union has no competence at all to interfere in the content of school curricula of third countries. Furthermore, even in schools within the European Union, as you are well aware, Mr Marinos, this falls within the sphere of subsidiarity, which means that it is within the exclusive competence of each Member State government to define the content of school lessons, both in state schools and in private schools, within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the Commission notes that, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law, principles shared by all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As confirmed at the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, in 1995, the promotion and protection of women’s rights are an integral part of universal human rights. In no circumstances can the Commission accept the abuse of an individual’s fundamental rights under the guise of religious beliefs, cultural practices or customs.</p>
<p class="contents">This position is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Articles 1, 4, 21, 23, 24) and by the other texts dealing with fundamental rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Articles 2 and 5 ) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 2, 3 and 14). Item 18 of the Vienna Declaration, adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, lays down that all forms of violence towards women, including those resulting from cultural prejudice, must be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of national protection of fundamental rights and of women’s rights in particular, it should be noted that the Community has been working on a policy to promote equality between the sexes since 1975. Equal access to the labour market, to governing bodies and to social rights are equally important rights in this respect, as well as the right to protection from violence and sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a raft of Community legislative measures, directives, and even case law from the Court of Justice, underpinned by a specific legal basis, Article 141 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. Incidentally, Article 3 of this Treaty imposes the obligation of integrating concerns about equality between the sexes into all Union policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will begin by saying that all the initiatives presented by the Commission in the field of asylum and illegal immigration contain specific legal rules to deal with the very special situation of women immigrants or women seeking asylum or refuge in the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have ensured that in the questioning relating to the granting of asylum there are specific conditions for dealing with the situation of women. For example, women who have been victims of sexual abuse can ask for the official doing the questioning to be changed, so that it is a woman rather than a man, because that will perhaps make them more feel more comfortable when recounting the story their asylum application is based on.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member has raised a very important issue: informing immigrants of their rights. Unquestionably, one of the Commission’s concerns is that it should be possible to provide immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers with the fullest possible information about their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if the honourable Member examines the Commission’s specific proposals to the Council and the European Parliament, both with regard to immigration and to asylum, she will see that the idea of information about rights is present. It is the responsibility of the national authorities of the Member States, as well as the non-governmental organisations which we work with very closely in these areas, to provide complete and full information on the rights which immigrants seeking asylum in the European Union can benefit from. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
