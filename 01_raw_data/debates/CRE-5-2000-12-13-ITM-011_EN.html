<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me – and this was also borne out in the vote of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy – that there is a very thin line indeed between the position of the Green rapporteur, Mr De Roo and that of the PPE-DE Group, a People’s Party which stands up against noise. Nevertheless, I have to refer to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure, and request a referral back to committee of Mr De Roo’s sound report. The reason for this is because, after some investigations, it appeared that a number of amendments, which the PPE-DE Group also supported when they were discussed initially in committee, contain a few technical problems. You know how strict noise standards are in the Netherlands. If these problems are looked at and it is established that something is wrong, then we would be happy to put them right, together with Mr De Roo and other members of the committee. Surely it must be possible for this House to make improvements on this report by means of a referral back. I would also add that a number of MEPs did not receive the correct English text until this morning, when we were discussing the report. This is why we request a referral back to committee and I would ask you to take a vote on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I <span class="italic">would</span> like to say to the PPE-DE Group is that it should at least not stand in the way of tonight’s discussions. The different positions can be articulated, the vote has not been scheduled for this evening, and if the largest group in Parliament is of the opinion that the vote should not take place tomorrow, it seems more appropriate to me to submit such a proposal tomorrow when we have a full House rather than doing it this evening. That would be premature and in so doing, we would miss the debate. If a group would like to vote against, it has of course every right to do so, but we must also give others the opportunity to vote in favour and let the democratic process run its course. What is now threatening to happen is that no viewpoints will be articulated, although I believe that clarity of this kind will be needed this evening before we can eventually take a vote some time in the future, whenever that may be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am indeed grateful for the support which the Christian-Democrats and, in fact, part of the Liberal Group, have lent to this one specific amendment to curb all aircraft noise. There is nothing stopping the Christian-Democrats, the Liberals or the Socialists from lending their support to this cause tomorrow by casting their vote. I fail to understand, actually, why, if the Christian-Democrats can support this cause in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, they cannot do the same again now. Should there be a minor technical hitch, we can rectify it in tandem with the Commission which is to issue a recommendation on these amendments. We can then iron out this minor inaccuracy. I am therefore in favour of holding a debate today and voting tomorrow, so that the Environmental Council can take a decision this coming Monday and Tuesday and that something can be done as soon as possible about noise, so that our citizens are subjected to less noise than is now the case.</p>

Ten years ago, in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, the European Commission estimated that 25% of the citizens of the EU were disturbed by noise from cars, trucks, aircraft, motorcycles, mopeds, trains, factories and boats. The Commission now estimates that one in every three Europeans complains about noise. In my own country, the Netherlands, this is 40%. Noise, especially at night, annoys more and more people. More than 10 million citizens in the EU are sleep-disturbed as a result. Too much noise from infrastructure affects the health of human beings, and reduces their quality of life. Eight years ago, the Commission promised to come forward with legislative proposals for European harmonised noise indicators before 1994 and for EU-wide noise standards before 1995. Only this year, six years overdue, and under enormous pressure from the French Government, has the Commission at last proposed European harmonised noise indicators. Those proposals are sound. <span class="italic">L</span><span class="italic">night</span> is an efficient indicator for sleep disturbance and the overall noise indicator <span class="italic">L</span><span class="italic">den</span> is probably the best in its field. This indicator sets 12 hours for the day, 4 hours for the evening and 8 hours for the night. Noise at night is calculated times 10 and noise in the evening times 5. The night should be eight hours long and that is of key importance, because at Frankfurt airport, the night is still only 6 hours long, compared to 6.5 hours at Heathrow and 7 hours at Schiphol. Most people need eight hours sleep. <span class="italic">L</span><span class="italic">den</span> is an annual average. The only time when <span class="italic">L</span><span class="italic">den</span> is not the most appropriate indicator is for high-pitched, short-term noise which is often generated by industrial plants. That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has suggested introducing the LA-max indicator.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidiarity – as will soon transpire from the debate – is an important element which the Environmental Committee would like to honour. It is left to the discretion of the Member States to determine when evening and the subsequent night fall. If people in Scandinavia wish to retire at 10 p.m. and the Spanish only at midnight, then that is not a problem, but those starting times for evening and night should be brought into line for all modes of transport, aircraft, road and rail, as well as industrial noise. The Environmental Committee has criticised the European Commission’s hesitation to propose EU noise standards. The Environmental Committee proposes turning them into a framework law with four daughter directives which encompass aircraft noise, noise from roads, rail noise and noise from industrial plants, but each time with a combined approach. An EU standard for noise as well as EU noise standards for aircraft, cars, trucks, trains and installations in plants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environmental Committee’s most controversial proposal is to develop a daughter directive on aircraft noise at this early stage. In this proposal, the Environmental Committee lays down specific standards for the years 2006, 2012 and 2020. Setting ever stricter noise standards must reduce noise levels of aircraft around airports. It is a moderate proposal, for Scandinavia already has stricter standards in place than those proposed for the year 2012. But major airports, such as Heathrow, Frankfurt and Paris will need to make considerable efforts to meet the initial set of standards by 2006. What is required, however, is a level playing field. I will give you one example: the Dutch Government introduced the margins of the night at Beek airport, which amounted to a flight ban between 1 and 5 a.m. As a result, noisy aircraft took their freight transport to Ostend, the Belgian seaside resort, which met with protest from the people in Ostend. At present, exactly the same noisy aircraft land in the middle of the night at the airport of Liège, 60 km south of Maastricht. That is not doing the European citizens any good, and that is why these standards are required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, noise was not considered a serious environmental problem for a long time. Now that environmental noise has gone through the roof, increased mobility being one of the specific causes, the number of people facing this problem has also increased greatly.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the Commission proposal, although I consider it to be an initial and – in my opinion – cautious step. The Commission does not have the courage to set European standards but aims in the first instance only to harmonise the noise pollution indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr De Roo proposes turning the directive into a framework directive. Our group has welcomed this suggestion with open arms. As far as legislation is concerned, I would, however, like to prioritise and, initially, to opt for regulation of noise around airports.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, wherever we are based, it appears that noise around airports is experienced as particularly disturbing. All the more reason, therefore, for a People’s Party such as ours, the PPE-DE, not to let aviation escape European legislation and to scrap the distinction made between military and civil aviation. We also need European legislation because, in my opinion, we can no longer allow aviation companies to ‘shop around’. Airports such as Orly, Schiphol and Barcelona already meet strict requirements. It is no longer acceptable for a market to be disturbed by unequal legislation within aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrepancies may lead to a situation where an airport on one side of the border, for example Maastricht, is not allowed to expand, while 50 km down the road, a new airport is built in Bierset without any restrictions. We must also consider the use of the terms of day and night and even margins of the night, concepts which lead to much confusion in the Netherlands too.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, what we need is uniformity for the sake of healthy competitive relations, but also for the people we represent, which is also the purport of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, rail and car traffic noise are issues which can be solved more easily by means of technical directives. I would therefore argue in favour of moving away from the idea of noise pollution or standards around road traffic axes but instead promote quieter vehicles and quieter trains. Anything above and beyond that is subject to subsidiarity, in my opinion, and should be up to the Member States to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">I will advise my group to vote against Amendments Nos. 36 and 49 because they contain a number of technical problems, not because the goals are pitched too high, but because the technical details cloud the issue. I would like to finish off with a word of thanks to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has now quoted far higher percentages, but the fact is that ambient noise is a serious and a major environmental problem. That is why the reduction and prevention of ambient noise will feature prominently in future European environment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the proposal from the Commission, but it does not go far enough for us. The harmonisation of noise-measurement procedures and the production of action plans by the Member States are good things but are not enough to satisfy us. That is why we are calling for a framework directive as a basis for Community action to assess and combat ambient noise. We call on the Commission to present proposals for daughter directives and to do so within 18 months of the entry into force of the framework directive. These daughter directives would set quality standards for all sources of noise, and I am pleased that the line taken by our group was adopted by a large majority of the committee and hope that the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange on that basis will also secure the necessary majority in tomorrow's vote.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, however, does not support the rapporteur's intention to use the directive to introduce limit values for ambient noise in the vicinity of airports. We have discussed the relevant amendments thoroughly in committee, but we believe that our line of approach, whereby quality standards for all specific sources of noise are to be the subject of daughter directives, is the more logical and consistent strategy. Another important proposal we have made, which will be of particular significance in the context of aviation noise, is that there should be an additional noise indicator over and above those that the rapporteur has enumerated. I therefore ask for your support for the amendment on the introduction of a noise indicator which defines a maximum level in addition to those which define mean levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that people became sleepless and stressed out and that their hearing became damaged, seemed to take second place to economic growth. Now that traffic noise, especially, is ever increasing, far-reaching measures have become inevitable. The largest airports are located in densely populated areas and their environments are becoming less and less inhabitable. It is important that, in those areas, everyone is guaranteed at least eight hours of peace and quiet at night and that governments no longer allow hours to be pinched from this total after designating these hours the so-called margins of the night. Member States have not been prescribed set times but rather a set number of hours, and quite rightly so. The rapporteur has shown great creativity in bringing forward framework directives, daughter directives and noise maps to be made available to the public. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is happy to support him in this, although we would have preferred to take things one step further in our efforts to find appropriate solutions and tackle those making money on the back of pollution. Now that it has transpired in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that our more far-reaching wishes cannot count on the support of the two major groups, I hope that at least the rapporteur’s moderate proposals will secure a majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They waste too much time in city traffic and have too little time left to be with their children; they work under terrible conditions and have no green spaces or leisure areas to rest in; they waste days in hospital queues and wrestle with civil service red tape. In our cities we rush along and lose sight of our well-being. Environmental noise must be brought into this lamentable picture. It is present throughout the day, making life even more tiring, and it is present at night, disturbing our well-earned rest.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, more and more European citizens are being affected by environmental noise. Despite this, however, the European Union has been slow to apply a common policy on the subject of noise. It took five years to put forward a proposal for harmonised European noise indicators. It is unacceptable that we should have to wait five more years to set the noise limits to be applied throughout the European Union. I therefore agree with the rapporteur, Mr De Roo, when he proposes that we should waste no more time and transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise into a binding framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The noise that most disturbs people’s sleep is that caused by night-time air traffic. The lack of common standards in the European Union has caused situations of clearly unfair competition between airports and a lack of equality among the citizens of different Member States. It is, therefore, essential that binding limits should be set on aircraft noise near airports. I believe, however, that Amendment No 36 is not the most sensible way to go about this. In any case, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In line with this directive, noise expressed in decibels is a measure of the standard of living. Credit should go to the rapporteur, in the first instance, and the support he has received in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this framework directive is to combat noise pollution on behalf of the European citizen. This directive contains a number of sound and important proposals: harmonisation, the use of common indicators and parameters, software and such like.</p>
<p class="contents">But allow me to say a few words on the bickering and the battle which has taken place recently behind the scenes, in and around, above and below, the committee, and which we witnessed in this Chamber a moment ago. The rapporteur included a number of indicators and aims for airports in his proposal. I can understand why he did this. This is a very hot topic in my own country too, and it is also keeping the citizens of my own country awake. It is our duty as MEPs and as a European institution to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I too would like clear goals, no question about that, but the standards which the rapporteur is proposing are premature at this moment in time. Another group may claim that the proposal contains technical problems. Or you may put it down to other causes. They are quite simply premature. We must give the Commission the time to do something about this, providing it does not take too long. That is why, in my opinion, the amendments tabled by Mr Bernd Lange are so important. I do hope they will meet with support and that the Commission will issue well-founded standards within eight months from now, because that is what it is all about, and I hope that we can reach a compromise in this area too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite Spain’s will and interest in establishing Community rules on this issue, there is a basic problem which profoundly affects the way of life in Spain. This is the establishment of a nuisance factor for noise after 7.00 p.m., which the proposal for a directive calls the ‘evening’. The Commission proposal, in point 1 of Annex 1, intends to systematically add on five decibels for all noise created between 7.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m.</p>
<p class="contents">For climatic and cultural reasons, life in Spain is lived later than in many other parts of Europe. It is obvious that the nuisance which may be caused by noise between 7.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. varies according to the different ways of life in each place.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain and in many Mediterranean countries, the normal day extends considerably later than the 7.00 p.m. indicated in the directive. I will therefore not hide the fact that it will be very difficult for my country to accept the Commission’s proposal, unless it incorporates a sufficient mechanism for flexibility so that we can maintain the way of life that we inherited from our ancestors and, furthermore, which is so valued both by the Spanish themselves and by our foreign visitors.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the formulae for flexibility that have been proposed consist of transferring part of the four hours of the mandatory evening to siesta time. But this mechanism is of no use, since, unfortunately, people do not sleep siestas all year in Spain and it is not even slept in the whole of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Elements of flexibility could be the option of reducing either the number of hours or the degree of nuisance which the proposal assigns to those evening hours. It would be the Member States who would determine the length of that period, according to their own customs.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support Amendment No 48 by Mr Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Florenz. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has done a lot of work and the Commission has produced an excellent initiative stimulated by colleagues who prompted the Commission during the last Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very serious issue affecting the health of millions of people and it requires a careful and thoughtful action to cure the problems. It is a complex problem. We cannot get away from that and we really require a step-by-step, calculated approach to dealing with the problems of noise in every locality, in every place and in every cultural situation within the Union and elsewhere. For that reason the most important elements of this report are the need to have harmonisation of measurement and assessment methods across the whole of the European Union so we can talk in comparable terms about the problems. We also need to build noise maps and measure the real problem in every locality to establish what can be done in each case and adopt local measures to do that and eventually, by a step-by-step approach, we can arrive at a real action programme which is cost-effective in the measures that we adopt and which achieves the solution that we are looking for, a genuine reduction in noise levels and consequent improvement in human health.</p>
<p class="contents">Some parts of the report propose too rapid and far too quick an approach to a problem which has not been properly and carefully assessed. It seems to me, for example, that the setting of noise limits at this time is presumptive. We need to assess exactly what measures can be taken at a local level and whether we need noise limits in future. We will have to progress down that road but the present proposal by the rapporteur goes too far in that direction at the moment.</p>

We have no intention whatsoever of pulling a fast one on the House. Listening to David Bowe, from a fairly significant parliamentary group, one is made particularly aware that it is not at all easy to rein in the airport operators to such a degree that the people who live close to our European airports, and for whom I have every sympathy, would actually notice any improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I have certainly been astounded to hear one or two speakers say that we need daughter directives. Now daughter directives are a fine thing – don't get me wrong. The only thing is that we have been fighting for such directives for twenty years. We need an instrument if we are to establish daughter directives. That, in principle, was the idea behind Amendment No 36, although I believe the idea has not been fully developed yet. That is why we needed breathing space to work on this idea so that it could be implemented. One thing is crystal-clear, Mrs Scheele: you are still very young, but however many years you spend in Parliament, you will never get a daughter directive on aviation noise! They will always find a way, be it to right, to left, down the middle or wherever, to wriggle out of it. They have economic interests too, and of course I understand that. So what we need are parameters. We have to establish them here in Parliament. That was the idea behind our desire to obtain ten more days or another fortnight.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, it is not so much a matter of the wishes we might have but rather of the wishes we manage to turn into policies. Once a football match is over, only the goals count. In that respect I am by no means overconfident. I am still quite curious to see how the dice will fall tomorrow. But to my great regret, Mr de Roo, I have to say that your good intention is probably dead in the water already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lange (PSE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, when I look at the proposal the Commission presented, I cannot help thinking of a scene in which a man is sitting by a stream in Finland, trying to catch salmon with a net. But the mesh is so wide that every salmon slips through. With that image in mind, I find it commendable that we are trying to tighten the mesh of the Commission's proposal in exactly the same way as we did with air and water quality. The first thing we need for this is a framework directive which prescribes measuring procedures and action plans, thereby establishing the basis for a general standardisation of noise-abatement policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need daughter directives which establish quality standards. In the realm of noise-abatement policy we must take particular care in determining the quality standards we wish to have; they must provide a basis on which the noise produced by air, rail and road traffic can be compared as well as taking account of the effects of different dosage levels. We must know the precise levels at which exposure starts to harm people in the long and short term. This means that daughter directives have to be developed very carefully, and this effort must go hand in hand with the development of limit values for particular sources of noise in a combined approach.</p>
<p class="contents">So we do need a framework directive and we need the combined approach, and I therefore regard much of what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has decided as right and proper. I have problems, however, with Amendment No 10 and Amendments Nos 36 and 37, which would bring the specific matter of aviation noise into the framework directive, thereby forestalling the daughter directive. We should examine that very carefully and then pursue the implementation of both parts of the combined approach, namely the establishment of limit values for the various sources of noise on the one hand and quality standards for noise sources on the other. This, I believe, is the way we should proceed.</p>

This is something we should bear in mind during our discussions. The European railways alone estimate that they will need to spend EUR 20 million on the noise maps, which is the Commission's assessment of the entire cost of implementing the directive. The railways alone expect to spend that amount. I should also like to emphasise that small and medium-sized businesses cannot possibly afford the cost of producing these noise maps.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should do better to switch to incentives. We ought to think about support initiatives which achieve the aim of restricting noise levels. It is also important that we think about the countries applying for accession to the EU. They too would like to be able to sleep peacefully but also to go about their work without disruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important framework directive even though I would have appreciated a few weeks maybe until the January plenary session to have a proper dialogue with all the parties involved as that would have made for sounder legislation in the end. Nonetheless I welcome the framework directive and certainly, before the specific points contained in Amendment No 36 and others were introduced, it would have been welcome all round this House.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first directive that deals with ambient noise as distinct from noise from a particular common source and that is to be welcomed. We all know the health hazards that noise brings to all our lives. It is an increasing hazard and how we go about handling it will be a measure of how successful we are. We cannot bounce people or communities or industries into specific standards without proper dialogue and consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I also ask whether the Commission could refer to the business impact assessment, which I am assuming they carried out on this proposal as is required under the Treaty. I would like to know what the bottom line actually was. I would fully support the need to harmonise noise indicators and assessment methods; the whole area of noise maps; the drawing up of action plans to reduce noise and protect quiet areas as appropriate and to broaden the whole scope for information to the public. I would also hope that when we get to a daughter directive, rather than this framework directive, in which we have the specific standards for an EU-wide playing field that the terrain and conditions and demography in each area will be taken into account and we will have time to debate that properly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we should be doing and how we should be handling it. For example, Amendment No 36 cites average measurements particularly in relation to night-time but one aircraft in the eight hours of night-time could come in so loudly and so noisily that it could wake the entire neighbourhood and yet comply with what is required by Amendment No 36. That is not what we want. It is not averages, it is specifics. We needed more time and I regret we did not have it even though I generally support the framework directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Environmental noise reduces the health and quality of life of at least 25% of the EU population. It causes illnesses such as stress and increased blood pressure as well as reductions in children's learning capacity. Aviation noise probably has the highest profile today in Europe, while locally noise from road traffic and sources such as trains and construction work is usually the biggest problem.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do in order to deal with this growing problem? It was tempting to use this directive and other directives to set new EU noise limit values as soon as possible. That may seem the logical way to control the level of noise but it would be premature to set new limit values in this way for two main reasons. Firstly, because we already have market access legislation which set limit values for many road vehicle types and for equipment used outdoors. It would be simpler and quicker to tighten the noise standards in the existing legislation than to introduce new daughter directives. We will consider what these standards needs to be once we have the evidence from strategic noise maps.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this proposal uses a new approach to assess the overall noise situation in Europe in terms of numbers of people who are disturbed by noise. It is impossible at the moment, because we use such a large variety of indicators and assessment methods, to characterise noise in different Member States. A particular problem is the noise around airports. Because of commercial competitiveness between airports and between aviation manufacturers it has not been possible to obtain correct and verified noise levels. Getting comparable information about the noise around airports will be a big step forward. The Commission would therefore not be able to support the amendments introducing airport limit values at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Once Member States have provided the comparable information then the Commission will consider the question of Community limit values and other measures to reduce the numbers of people affected by noise and report back to the Council and Parliament. As a general means of improving the situation, we propose that authorities in Member States should produce action plans in close consultation with the public. They should outline any measures that Member States take or plan to take to reduce the noise problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not prescribing what measures should be taken. This is for the Member States to decide. However, the action plans must be published, even if all they say is that no improvements are planned, so that people living locally will know the situation and will be able to discuss the issue with their elected representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Members for their amendments strengthening the text and public participation, which we wholeheartedly accept. Our first priority is to produce strategic noise maps using standardised indicators and assess all types of noise to give us an accurate picture of the number of people who are suffering and where. Our first report on the directive is due to be submitted to Parliament in 2007. This will include a careful consideration of limit values. A five-yearly review process will then ensure that Members have a continued input. We value your input and welcome the majority of amendments you have contributed today. I hope we can now agree a positive way forward with a view to achieving a common position with the Council next week.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the amendments are concerned, the Commission has considered 49 amendments and is able to accept 25 of them fully or in part. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 3, 14, 18, 27, 30, 34, 35 and 43. The following amendments are acceptable in principle or in part: Amendments Nos 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 25, 28, 29, 32, 39, 42, 44 and 45. The Commission cannot accept the other amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude I would like to thank European Parliament for the detailed consideration it has given to this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been contributed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
