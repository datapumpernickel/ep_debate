I welcome Commissioner Potočnik here today. There is a great deal of goodwill towards the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme, as demonstrated by the speed with which the committee has conducted its business on the Locatelli report. I hope the Commission will build upon this goodwill and not dissipate it.</p>
<p class="contents">The research community and the wider community expect a great deal from the Seventh Framework Programme, as it is seen as a crucial part of the Lisbon strategy for strengthening the European economy. Research and development are key elements in that process. Therefore, it is all the more important for us to get this right.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the purpose behind this oral question today is to give you the opportunity to share some thoughts with us before making your proposal to the Council and Parliament on how research is to be funded. It seems to us that the crucial question relates to the doubling of expenditure on the research programme within the overall EU budget. Can this fine ambition be achieved? How it is going to be achieved? We are looking with keen anticipation to you, Commissioner, to tell us how you think you are going to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the existence of the 'one per cent club' of Member States who wish to keep European-level spending within an overall cap of one per cent of GDP, I want to offer some suggestions as to ways in which spending on research might be increased at a European level, without necessarily breaching that one per cent cap, and given that there seems to be no lack of goodwill on the part of Member States to spend more on research.</p>
<p class="contents">The first suggestion is that the proposals for the spending programme with regard to research on security should be funded by the Member States at European level, but outside the Seventh Framework Programme. Therefore, it would not count as part of the relevant budget item.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I see great potential for using part of the Cohesion Fund for directing research spending to the new Member States, and I hope you will be sympathetic to that suggestion, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the third suggestion. Mr Mayor Oreja heads a special working group on the European Research Council, which has suggested that an independent body of scientists should take the programme of research forward, and that this should happen on the basis of excellence and scientific merit. Quite a substantial budget has been proposed for this, totalling EUR 2 billion a year once the working-up phase is complete. That will take a huge slice of the existing framework budget. I would therefore suggest that Member States should also consider funding that outside the context of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we will take on board a number of the suggestions in the Marimon report. One of the most frequently-voiced concerns about our research activities at European level is the complexity and burden involved in the administrative procedures and regulations relating to the funds, which make it very difficult for small- and medium-sized enterprises and small research entities to access the funds and take part in the programmes. We all pay at least lip service to this. Even when were debating the Fourth Framework Programme, there was a great deal of concern about that. We talk about it; let us hope this time, Commissioner, you are able to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of pursuing excellence above all else is crucial to achieving successful research at European level. I look forward to your comments about how we fund all this with keen interest, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to thank you, and in particular the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for this opportunity to discuss in plenary the issue of doubling the research budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I start by saying how happy I am that Mrs Locatelli's report on the future of European research received almost unanimous support from the ITRE committee on Monday. This report, which I understand will be voted on in the March part-session, gives us an excellent grounding in preparing the formal Commission proposal for the new framework programme. I would particularly like to thank two members of the committee, Mr Chichester and Mrs Locatelli.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me first to underline that today's discussion is not just important for research. It is a debate about nothing less than our credibility to reach the Lisbon objectives, and is a crucial debate for both our institutions only a few weeks before Europe hopefully agrees on the financial means for the next decade.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion about the new Financial Perspectives is a moment of truth and the question of sufficient funding for European research is an essential part of it. This is because research is about knowledge, and knowledge is truly a European strength in global competition. Let me explain.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our trading partners are competing with primary resources, which we do not have. Some compete with cheap labour, which we do not want. Some compete on the back of the environment, which we cannot accept. The only way for European enterprise to build sustainable leadership is to exploit the knowledge triangle fully: the creation, transmission and use of knowledge through research, education, training and of course innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">My strong conviction is that European enterprises will only achieve competitiveness and leadership on global markets if we rapidly put Europe in the lead as an economy and as a knowledge society. We are strong in knowledge, but we can become even stronger if we pool our efforts in an intelligent way; if we give full emphasis to excellence; and if we use the full research potential throughout the EU – old, new and future. This is what I want the next research programme to stand for.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge does not only mean more competitive businesses. It also brings continuous progress to society: progress in fields such as health; preservation of the environment; and sustainable energy supply. All of these rest largely on the progress of knowledge. In view of this, the questions you raised are indeed the right ones.</p>
<p class="contents">First, will the Commission fight for the doubling of the research budget? The answer is yes. In February 2004, when launching the debate on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union, the Commission emphasised the role research will play in building our common future and consequently proposed the doubling of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This was reaffirmed in the Commission's communication on the Financial Perspectives last July and President Barroso confirmed the approach to this House last December, when he endorsed the Financial Perspective that had been proposed by the Prodi Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The last confirmation came in the proposal of the Lisbon mid-term review. It spells out clearly the importance of investment in research and development. On behalf of the European Commission, I can therefore confirm not only our strong commitment to research, but also that we will do everything to achieve the doubling of the research budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, does this doubling take account of the programme's duration, inflation, enlargement and the need to support new actions? I am very grateful for these questions. It is good that we clarify these fully justified issues. FP7 will be the principal financial tool for realising the ambitious objective of driving productivity growth and ensuring competitiveness through knowledge. When I speak about the doubling of funds I am talking about doubling the budget of FP7. This figure does not include related Community programmes such as Mr Gunther Verheugen's programme for competitiveness and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal will not simply be a doubling of the initial FP6 budget. It will be built on the basis of the yearly amount to be spent on research during the period 2007-2013 compared to the yearly estimated amount for FP6, and revised following accession. This means doubling on a yearly basis regardless of the duration of FP7. Moreover, in the Financial Perspectives these amounts will be adjusted for inflation according to our general calculation methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is one particular issue. In the area of research, enlargement was a reality long before the Accession Treaty was signed. The current candidate countries also participate in the Framework Programme. I could, therefore, answer this question by saying that it is true that enlargement has been taken into account, but I would have to add immediately that it is not only in the budgetary figures that enlargement needs to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I want this programme to be built on excellence, because I know this is also a strength of the new Member States. However in addition, I want this programme to be an enabling one that allows the use of the full research potential in the new Member States and creates an active and effective link with the Structural Funds. Additional new areas of research are included and are part of the justification for doubling the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, will the FP7 proposal cover basic research, space research and security research? To be brief, our FP7 proposal will be all inclusive, i.e. there will be no mechanisms outside the framework programme. Let me make an important addition here. Parliament has highlighted that the complementary objectives of continued reinforcement of existing EU research support, on the one hand, and of support to new areas of research that are of interest to the EU, on the other, require adequate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, it would not be possible to strengthen existing activities in an efficient way and, at the same time, introduce widely supported new activities, such as the European Research Council and technology initiatives, if the research budget was not doubled. Doubling will enable us to take a decisive step forward in our overall research policy and in continuing support for the European Research Area. Agreement on the substance of future research activities necessarily implies agreement on adequate funding for these activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, how will the Commission try to influence the debate on the Financial Perspectives to achieve the doubling of research funds? In order to underpin the debate on the Financial Perspectives, the Commission will present its proposal for FP7 on 6 April. This will help Parliament to give its preliminary reactions to the Council that your rapporteur, Mr Borg is planning to present during the May part-session. It will also allow the ministries for research and science to have an initial discussion at the Competitiveness Council on 18 April. The Commission proposal will provide sound justification for doubling the budget for FP7, based on a detailed and thorough assessment of the impact of the research and development instruments on investment in growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will list the two main reasons for doubling the funding. The first – and, for me, the most important set of reasons – is the need for the European Union to be credible in delivering the renewed Lisbon Agenda on growth and jobs. This includes the need to deliver results on the 3% GDP target for research and development that was mutually agreed in Barcelona. Doubling the funding is one of the crucial steps towards a more growth-oriented European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of reasons is more specific to research and development spending. Firstly, we need high public spending on research and development because it is an important source of R&amp;D investment and for its strong leverage effect on private investments in research and development in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need more R&amp;D funding at EU level because of the strong added value of European research funding through the critical mass of resources, sharing of knowledge and facilities, strengthening excellence through close cooperation, competition at European level, the coordination of national activities and support for European Union policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add to that the fact that we are currently rejecting an unacceptable number of excellent proposals purely because of the lack of financial resources. In addition, there is the need and willingness to fund new category and activity initiatives which demonstrate high value added impact at EU level without, however, endangering existing ones. Finally, we should not forget the very simple fact that the costs of research itself are also growing.</p>
<p class="contents">Your fifth question was whether the duration of FP7 should be synchronised with the Financial Perspectives to ensure a better coordination of planning activities?</p>
<p class="contents">Reaching the goals that I have described will require a long-term view and commitment. That is why the Commission will propose that the duration of FP7 should be the same overall as the next Financial Perspective for 2007-13. We should take stock mid-way through the programme to ensure that FP7 continues to respond to the needs faced by the European economy and citizens. By doing so we will introduce more stability on the one hand, and more flexibility on the other. Both factors are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take this opportunity to underline the exemplary execution rates in the research budget. The current execution rates are close to 100%. We have proved in the past that we can effectively manage constantly increased FP budgets. We are aware that the challenge to managing the doubling of the funds is demanding, but we are determined to provide proper answers. Simplification and rationalisation of procedures are greatly needed. Administration and modernised management, including externalisation, will provide answers to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in the field of research are at the core of the delivery of the new Lisbon Agenda. That is the only way we can succeed. The time for delivery is now. Building a knowledge society is probably the best, and perhaps only, way to sustain the European social model without having to make a trade-off between economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection. The first and foremost policy priority for the Union is thus to strongly support the three sides of the knowledge triangle – research, education and innovation – and to ensure that the triangle operates in the most favourable framework conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The change in the structure of the European budget in favour of more growth and competitive oriented expenses in the direction proposed by the Commission is thus crucial. This structural change to the European budget should also be followed by the Member States in their budgets. The doubling of funds in the European budget should not be seen as compensation for the reduction of Member States' efforts. On the contrary, it should be an example followed by the Member States. Their effort is necessary. If we do not make the effort now, we will have to make it later; but it will be more difficult later and it could even be too late.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to do my best to achieve the vision I have described because I believe it is the right one. We can bring it to life by working together.

He is also taking steps to ensure that the Lisbon agenda is implemented and promises great things, such as new jobs and higher incomes for our people. On the other hand, there are Commissioners who are in favour of REACH and emissions trading, which would result in the relocation of large parts of our industry outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to congratulate the Commissioner on having made a knowledge-based European Union his main priority, and on not merely following in the footsteps of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, but intends to strike out on an entirely new path with the Seventh Framework Programme. The aim of this is not only to implement the Lisbon criteria, but above all to target the Financial Perspectives at new, better and more secure jobs and to ensure that Europe can hold its own in international competition, as what a further priority should be to safeguard existing jobs. Achieving this by 2010 will be a far from easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether it takes place on the basis of a certain percentage of GDP or not, and however it is calculated, we regard doubling as a way to send out a signal, namely that on the one hand we are debating using 1% of GDP for the European Union, but that on the other hand we are talking about spending 3% on research. It is apparent from this how large the gap is when it comes to dealing efficiently with issues relating to our future. I believe that this goal – knowledge-based training and further training and life-long learning in connection with research findings at university, with a clear focus on new jobs – must be pursued, and that for this reason we must also demand of the Research Council that its representatives from business and research departments have a large say in shaping the goals, and that the political goals we fund with the Lisbon agenda are implemented accordingly and that we get a grip on bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are stumbling from one accusation of fraud to another, and a great deal of criticism is currently being levelled at Europe. Yet we should highlight the positive aspects, and the opportunities we are creating in Europe for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to urge Mr Potočnik to come to Parliament immediately after the programme has been adopted in the European Commission on 6 April. An extended Conference of Presidents will take place here, and the President of the Commission should join you in presenting the Seventh Framework Programme to the public. We should take this opportunity to make a big impression on the public, and to show them that we take the Lisbon goals seriously and want to achieve them.</p>

We are adding this to the Lisbon objectives, as I noticed the Commissioner is also doing. We are therefore in agreement with Commissioner Potočnik. The problem is the Member States. It is the Finance Ministers of the Member States and Ecofin that are our targets and whom we should be grabbing by the scruff of the neck. Only two Member States have achieved the 3% target for research, my own country being one of them. We therefore have a lot of housework to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We require some exceptionally determined work from the Commission, and this really is, as you have said, the first test, or actually a test both for you and for us. The funding is to be doubled, but where is it being channelled? This must be kept in mind the whole time, because it is no good having funding unless you know what to do with it. I would like to know exactly which areas it is destined for. How important, for example, is the lack of digital literacy? It has been calculated that we lose three hours a week because of it. Here, moreover, the working week is being lengthened. In many cases these three hours would salvage our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, of course, we have to consider enlargement. I am one of those who believe that 1% on the budget is not enough to take care of enlargement, the Lisbon Process and many other matters. We certainly knew that enlargement would cost money, and the budget cannot subsequently be reduced: it should remain at the same level it has done up till now. Finally, we need more training, know-how and research. That is the only way out of this vicious circle of competitiveness.</p>

In fact, when it was established, there was not yet such a pressing need to revitalise the competitiveness of the European Union, such a massive and important enlargement had not taken place, international competition had not yet emerged so forcefully, and nor had a knowledge-based strategy such as the Lisbon strategy yet been formulated.</p>
<p class="contents">All of that has now happened and, furthermore, very little has been done in terms of the Lisbon objectives. We therefore need to make up for lost time, considering that half of the time laid down for them has already passed. We must pull out all the stops, starting precisely with research, which sustains all the progress we make. To this end, last Monday the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy approved the three main lines of action for the next framework programme: the European Research Council, the new research proposals and the technology platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Research Council has emerged out of the acknowledgment that basic research now has an importance which goes beyond the Member States and must be supported at Union level and in accordance with the Lisbon strategy. It is an initial focus around which we can elaborate a development and competitiveness policy, which will then be filled out in the technology platforms. These platforms must obtain resources chiefly from enterprises, but also from public institutions, the Member States, regions and local authorities, in order to organise research of general interest and to help businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, meet the need for research in order to make them competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">These are sound, decisive innovations which will give fresh impetus to our businesses. We must have a presence in the new sectors, adopt innovative measures and provide conventional manufacturing businesses with a new competitive capacity if we do not wish to sit idly by as Europe undergoes full deindustrialisation. We must be consistent and invest in research which, even when it is not strictly targeted, has an extremely high potential for return. Perhaps it will not suffice to double the funds but, in any case, we cannot afford to be too sparing when it comes to these resources. I would make it clear that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in order to face this challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, not only are we concerned about the budget, but also about the social and environmental ends, because we all want a larger cake. However, of primary importance are the ingredients of the cake and how it is cooked and then, but also extremely important, how the cake of European research is shared out.</p>
<p class="contents">We want open science, with a fluid and open transfer of knowledge to all sectors of society, and, within this context, we are worried that some patents may represent obstacles to innovation in the case of small and/or young companies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we want to see a type of research for which small is beautiful, in which SMEs, small laboratories and small universities are treated as priorities within European programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, we want to create ‘clusters’, groups of small companies at European level, in order to prevent all research from being concentrated within a few projects. In the field of research, we should promote a return to basics, to fundamentals, so that basic scientific research can be supported openly and provided with more funds. We must offer more public support to basic research, with social and environmental objectives in the medium and long terms, rather than restricting ourselves to achieving short-term technological performance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, there must also be more investment in preventive health and not just in pharmaceutical research, as has happened in the past. Furthermore, we must invest in protecting the climate and not direct all or most of our investment in energy towards nuclear programmes. Renewable energy currently needs a level of support which is at least equivalent to that being given to the ITER or Euratom programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased with Mr Potočnik’s projects in support of social sciences, since they are essential to progress in research into our society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to call for the creation of an independent European Research Council, with the participation of all the social actors, so that there may be a genuinely fruitful debate, a dialogue, between society and the scientific world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first relates to the total volume of funding for science and research. I believe that certain instruments that we could use, such as European securities, are currently being neglected. In the USA a number of key projects are funded by securities, and this could also act as a financial basis for key European projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Another way to boost funding would be to exploit the resources available in the new Member States. The research potential in these countries is extremely strong, although it is currently underfunded. The costs of achieving research goals could realistically be reduced if these countries were involved.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the way in which the 3% is to be structured. The Commission is relying on two thirds of this money coming from the private sector. This will be very difficult to achieve, however, given that only 3% of small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay 85% of all business taxes and provide 75% of jobs, currently invest in research, and 40% of them are involved in innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will make no progress in this field without a new policy on depreciation, generous funding for investment, flexible legislation, a new credit policy and tax relief. I believe that it is also crucial that there be a high ratio of research workers to technicians. At present the European Union is lagging 50% behind the US with regard to the number of researchers for every 1000 workers; in other words, the US has 50% more researchers for every 1000 workers. Major technological breakthroughs and key discoveries need to be based on a constant stream of minor innovations, and at present this is not happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to note that research follows certain laws. In the past this was analysed in terms of Kondratiev waves, whereby key breakthroughs were found to be concentrated in clearly defined clusters. We should provide generous funding in order to ensure that clusters of this kind come into being once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you want to double funding – and many millions of Europeans would be in favour of doing so, if only they knew anything about it, and indeed I am in favour of it, although I only know a little about it – what investments do you actually want to boost by doing so? Experience has shown that 80% of funding from the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes has gone to the large corporations, and only 20% to those that could be termed SMEs or that are of an even smaller size.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the main reason for this is that lobbyists – in particular those acting on behalf of the large corporations – have an above-average amount of influence. They have long since taken a good look around and asked where they can get even more money if funding is to be doubled. These people are very good at their jobs. The second most important reason, however, lies within the Commission itself. Many of the measures you take – and having been a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for many years, I can say that this has always been the case – demonstrate that you still follow the same old motto as the World Bank: ‘big is beautiful’. It is an unfortunate fact that the Commission is making the same mistake that the World Bank made, by constantly funding oversized projects all over the world. The new and enlarged Commission has a real chance of preventing such a mistake and moving away from the 80:20 ratio that favours large businesses. This would be a sure-fire way of creating jobs, and it would mean that progress was made with all aspects of the European dream.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question, of course, is which areas really receive investment. I should like to warn you against pretending to Europeans that military armament in the field of research can result in any kind of positive progress, and against making the same mistakes that history is full of. What we are seeing is a new armament by stealth in the EU, and I can only issue the most fervent of warnings against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Less dramatic, but equally important, is the nuclear issue. It is absolutely crucial, Commissioner, that if you wish to double funding you must make it quite clear what is actually going where. Transparency is needed so that people know exactly where funding is intended to go, and so that action is not taken behind closed doors. When it comes to informing the public about how funds are used, the European Union will have to decide whether it wishes to move towards propaganda – made what it is by Josef Goebbels, himself the subject of much debate at present – or towards information, with the pioneer of this approach being Jean-Jacques Rousseau. For Europe's sake, I would ask that you move towards informing citizens about funding.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I believe that 1% of GDP from Member States will be more than enough for you to manage with. There are a great many ways in which money could be saved in the EU. This House alone has EUR 50 million to spend this year, and has no idea what it should do with it all. In this instance less would mean more, and doubling is in no way incompatible with a maximum of 1%, which is what many countries want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main indicators for developments in this sector clearly show not only that we are lagging behind the world leaders, but mainly that we are unable to make use of our own research and innovation potential. There is an undoubted need sharply to increase the volume of resources allocated to this important area, but this must be in line with our financial perspectives. It is not, however, clear how this is to be implemented. The framework programmes for research and technological development, which have been the main tool in the European Union’s implementation strategy, have been found, for various reasons and throughout their existence, to be inadequate in promoting the research and innovation potential of mainly small and medium-sized enterprises. It has been most frequently a matter of the complexity of the entire structure and procedures for access to financial resources, which deters mainly small research and innovation units or small companies. Regional experiences also point to other reasons: there is a lack of an adequate regional infrastructure, relevant institutions, such as university development centres, technological incubators, high-tech centres and so on but also of risk capital funds, which would, on the one hand, stimulate regional innovation and research potential in its broader sense, but also create a stronger competitive environment, on the other hand. The European Union budget must take account of both an increased level of financing for its framework programmes and a strengthened budget for the structural funds in order to establish a regional research infrastructure and also strengthened programmes for the European financial institutions to stimulate the development of regional risk capital funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This affirmation needs to be substantiated, something which you, Mr Potočnik, have already done in part. In addition to the issues of enlargement and the new activity headings, namely space and research, I would point out that the Constitutional Treaty confers fresh powers on the Union in the field of research. I would also like to mention that the European Research Council will be established, a new instrument which we assume will use up 10 to 15% of the overall resources of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Potočnik, you are already aware of the outcome of the vote of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the guidelines for the Seventh Framework Programme. The document calls for additional funding within the Seventh Framework Programme for the European Research Council. It also states that a doubling of the budget is the bare minimum if we truly intend to give substance to a European Research Area and pursue the objectives under the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you whether you agree with the European Research Council being funded from additional resources. And with regard to doubling the budget, what is meant by doubling? We need to find a criterion and I would suggest a criterion of proportion, that is, the framework programme resources as a percentage of the Union’s gross domestic product. That is the percentage that we should double. I therefore ask you, do you agree with this interpretation of doubling?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we know that at this stage in the preparation of the Financial Perspectives, there is a major debate underway among the Member States because some of them intend to cut their contribution to the budget of the European Union to 1%. These cuts are likely to have negative repercussions on the ‘research appropriations’ item. Do you agree to fight hard to oppose this position taken by the less generous Member States? And if, in any case, these cuts are effected, will you still be in favour of calling for the funds to be doubled? The Seventh Framework Programme must not merely be a new framework programme, but it must mark a turning-point, in line with the Union’s new powers, if we really want to create a new European Research Area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this is the answer to a very large number of problems. I also think it is right to focus on education, research and innovation, dealing with each of these areas separately but also in the context of the other two.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the technology platforms will serve a very useful purpose. It is good that the social sciences are included in this connection. What we need to focus on is, of course, the infrastructure surrounding research, about which we have not yet had a great deal of discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to raise two matters that are of concern to me. The first relates to the way in which European researchers experience professional and social conditions at a personal level. We see how, in the current situation, large numbers of people are leaving research for other jobs because they find it impossible to carve out careers and create good bases for family life, given the rules and conditions we lay down for them. This is, of course, all the more regrettable now we know that, with this new research policy, we shall require not fewer, but twice as many, researchers. I want to know what measures the Commission intends to take in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter of concern to me is, of course, industry’s share of the total resources allocated to research. The general trend in all the Member States is for this to go down instead of up. I want to know what the Commission is doing to make industry more enthusiastic about investing more in research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are seeing the framework for a new European research policy, we must, finally, at the same time also think about how to translate these research results into job opportunities. I should therefore also like to see an initial fundamental framework programme for innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When you realise that public and private research and development expenditure in the EU amounts to only 1.95% of GDP compared with 2.64% in the United States and 2.98% in Japan, you can see how much the famous Lisbon strategy and the Commission have failed. That is why I believe that if the European Union is to have an effective research policy, we must not only double the appropriations for research but also review and radically question the methods and objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development implemented by the European Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, contrary to the philosophy of the Seventh Framework Programme, a successful research and development system can only be based on cooperation and exchange between public and private researchers and laboratories and not on all out competition and shortage of money.</p>
<p class="contents">What I fear the most is that resources will be concentrated in a small number of priority areas of research, which are bound to be those most likely to bring immediate profits for the large industrial groups, at the expense of fundamental physics and the human and social sciences; that would mean researcher recruitment and careers would probably no longer be based on scientific assessment but on priorities directly dictated by the interests of the multinationals involved in the framework programme’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I, of course, believe that research expenditure must be taken out of the Stability Pact calculation, but that is not enough. It is even more important that questions of research in Europe should no longer be decided by the Commission alone, but by elected representatives of the scientific community. I therefore propose the creation of a representative assembly of all researchers at the European Parliament. That assembly would have such important tasks as ethical appraisal, the drafting of recommendations, encouraging cooperation, monitoring and continuity of the funding granted, and ensuring that the regions are not forced to compete with each other. That is the only way in which the European Union will be able to look to the future with greater optimism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know better than we do, Commissioner, the research programmes will have an even greater effect if you use them to build a bridge between, on the one hand, the research and development programmes under the Cohesion Policy, and, on the other, the Seventh Framework Programme. If the two instruments are brought into line with each other, they will be a great deal more far-reaching in their effects. Please allow me to give an example from my own region, which is bounded by the frontiers between the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the universities of Eindhoven, Louvain, and Aachen, as well as those of Hasselt and Maastricht, now cooperate closely in research, training and development, as well as in the field of cohesion projects. I believe that similar cross-border collaborative projects deserve to be followed and encouraged, as they primarily reinforce the regional dimension as part of the Lisbon process. Surely nobody can object to the towns, universities and regions within which they move and operate playing such a role?</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore particularly pleased to see the Commission accept an amendment to that effect proposed by Mr van Nistelrooij to the Locatelli report after all, which Parliament approved at the beginning of this week. In it, this House expressly requests cooperation with the regions and the coupling of, on the one hand, national programmes under the Structural Funds and, on the other, programmes under the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Commissioner, businesses are, as you know, ready to invest and to anticipate the opportunities that are presenting themselves. If we in the EU, who deal with financial matters, now allow them to pass by, if our fine words about innovation policy are not followed up by action, then our credibility will, of course, be shattered – both yours and ours, I would say. We will then be giving national governments the ideal excuse for not coming up with the national funding that is so vitally needed. At the moment there exists what is termed a ‘window of opportunity’, with many members of government at every level – regional, national and, of course, European too – being convinced that we must drastically upgrade our investments in innovation. If we simply allow this to ebb away, then I think we will have to look among ourselves to find the reason why. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, knowledge is now to be understood in the broad sense of the word, and if we look at the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme in the context of the Sixth – and also going back to the Fifth Framework Programme – we can see that socioeconomic research played an important part at that time and contributed to an analysis and understanding of the interaction between advanced technologies and social development. Separating scientific and sociological research when drafting the Seventh Framework Programme has, however, in actual fact put sociological research into budgetary competition with technological research in relation to the IST programme. This tends to marginalise the relevance of socioeconomic research, and, in future, technological research should therefore be developed in tandem with the development of society’s needs, values and expectations. Socioeconomic research in the information society is a precondition for our achieving this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I should like to take the opportunity of today's debate to approach the matter differently. I therefore ask:</p>
<p class="contents">First, is it or is it not our strategic choice that the European economy should become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if the answer is yes, I would like to know the degree to which, in order to achieve this objective – and this is something in which I truly believe – the economy of the European Union must become and it is enough if it becomes a knowledge-based economy?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if the answer is again yes then, logically, should the European research community, companies and industry not be wondering about the means needed to complete this mission? In other words, should the bottom-up approach not be used in our case, by which I mean consultation with the people who produce knowledge and innovation in Europe, in the aim of our agreeing where and exactly how much we should invest in order to achieve our objective?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, ultimately what we need to achieve is not double the resources, but our strategic objective and this begs the question as to whether double is enough to achieve our objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no question that if we are to achieve the objectives set in the Lisbon strategy for 2010, we must be committed to improving substantially the resources dedicated to Research and Development, since that is the central pivot of a knowledge-based economy and, therefore, the main tool for promoting growth, employment and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we agree that the Union's scientific policy should be placed at the centre of the strategy for the coming years, and also that overall spending on Research and Development should be set at 3% of the Union's GDP, and, of course, I agree with what most of the previous speakers have said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add something else. It is certainly very important to reduce the technological gap between the Union and countries such as the United States, but it is just as true that within the Union there is another significant technological gap between the different countries, which we must also try to reduce. In this regard, our objective must be to improve the competitiveness of the Union as a whole, in order to narrow the gap with the most technologically-advanced countries, but we must do so in such a way that this does not involve increasing the differences between our various countries in terms of technological capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important, Commissioner, that we take concrete measures to improve the capacity of the countries which so far have participated less in the framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we would ask that you commit yourself to reducing the internal technological gap which unquestionably also exists within our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to do that, we need money, and so we must increase funding. Commissioner, you have my full support in obtaining the Council’s agreement with the help of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we ask for more money we must see to it that these funds are put to the best possible use. We must also learn the lessons from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and make procedures simpler, less bureaucratic and more streamlined. I see this as an absolutely crucial task that we must all strive to achieve, and both the Commission and Parliament are needed in this respect. The members of the Committee on Budgets are presently examining the Financial Regulation, and this is another area where work must be done and improvements made. Commissioner, this is another task for which you and your College are needed. What is needed is professional project management, and I am eagerly awaiting your proposals on this issue on 6 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to return to the lessons we should learn from the Sixth Framework Programme. Industry involvement fell under the Sixth Framework Programme, and we must come up with ideas of ways to buck this trend. If we are serious about the Lisbon goals, we simply need more investment in research and development. Such investment must also come from the private sector, and I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's ideas in response to the following question; how do you intend to get industry, in small and medium-sized enterprises, more involved in the Seventh Framework Programme?</p>
<p class="contents">I listened very attentively to Mr Ransdorf’s comments; he mentioned that we need, among other things, a better depreciation policy and more flexible legislation. These are useful considerations, but I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's proposals in this regard as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Seventh Framework Programme has presented us with a unique opportunity to move towards this goal by improving the way we exploit the intellectual potential of the European Union’s 450 million citizens, including its almost 80 million new citizens in the new Member States. The Seventh Framework Programme should accelerate European integration, and it should provide not only for a much-needed and significant rise in funding, but also for measures under which this funding will be put to effective use. This will only be possible if entirely new and innovative methods are devised for implementing European policy on science.</p>
<p class="contents">The main priority should be to alter the criteria according to which funds are distributed, as this will make it possible to establish centres of expertise at institutions where the researchers are based. Students from Central and Eastern Europe do not wish to be treated as an afterthought, or sometimes merely as the odd ones out, in ‘Centres of Excellence’ programmes, as is the case under the current Sixth Framework Programme. Two questions come to mind in this connection. The first is whether the concept of ‘excellence’ is not being misused here as a strange kind of curse, which can later be invoked to justify an unequal distribution of funds. We should not strive for excellence only with regard to gaining and spending funds. The second question that arises concerns the kind of objective criteria for the distribution of funds provided for in the Seventh Framework Programme. I thank you.</p>

It is very encouraging for my future work. Many questions were asked, some of which I cannot answer very precisely, but I will group them together and try to be as informative as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The calculation behind doubling is made in real terms on a yearly basis and with the same assumptions in mind as with the other aspects of the debate on the new financial perspective. At the end of the day it is crucial that we double the funds as a percentage of GDP. That is a credible way of looking at it. Our proposal was based on that thinking and I believe that this proposal is ambitious enough to achieve our goals. I am more afraid of going backwards than of asking whether it goes far enough, although even that question is credible, too, and could be approached in an official way.</p>
<p class="contents">Public funding is not the only funding. As you know, public funding is estimated as being approximately one-third, with two-thirds private funding. So it is crucial that we increase public funding, because of the source and because of the leverage effect on private investment. However, as some of you stressed, it is even more crucial to create conditions under which companies will stay and invest in Europe. The latest figures are not promising: in 2002, investment by the 500 biggest companies in the European Union decreased by 2%; investment by the 500 biggest non-EU companies increased by 3.9%.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, around 24% of investment involves the car and spare part industries. In the rest of the world, information technology is the biggest sector with regard to investment. Those are the facts we have to deal with. That is why it is crucial to create a better environment for research and development. Ways of doing this might include state aid; tax incentives; intellectual property rights; the structural and cohesion funds; and risk and venture capital, which is certainly one of the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Two days ago, I met the President of the European Investment Bank and we have already started to prepare actions in an effort to address that problem. Environment is crucial. If we want to achieve our goal, we need to create an environment in which companies will work, compete and carry out their research and development activities in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework programme now being discussed in the Commission has to take account of the Lisbon Agenda. I would like it to be simple, flexible, understandable, easily applicable and based on continuity. We would like to establish four major areas of support.</p>
<p class="contents">First, cooperation. Today we call this the 'collaborative approach', although in some countries the term 'collaboration' is not particularly acceptable. That area should be more industry-driven than it was in the past. That is why technology platforms should play an important role in deciding where money will go and how decisions are taken. It will be more thematically orientated and less instrumental than in the past. I believe that is the proper way to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is ideas. This means the European Research Council. This area is researcher-driven, so the division between basic and applicable research is practically outdated. We would try to make it clear what is industry-driven, what is politically driven and what is research-driven. That will be more transparent. We will give everyone the opportunity to make known their views on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area should be people. The major problem there is that they have been under-financed. The fourth area is capacities, which involves infrastructure, SMEs, regions and research potential. Here, we would like to address the question of new Member States, but not in a way that would undermine the excellence of the programme. Researchers in those countries should be supported so that they develop and become more visible. We should establish actions which allow us to access the structural and cohesion funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst thing for the new Member States and their researchers would be to create conditions under which they would not be able to compete. It is best for them to develop rapidly so that they are competitive from the very beginning. They are doing that already. I am very much aware that conditions in some countries mean that they cannot compete. We have to help them, but the question is how we do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our programme seeks to achieve excellence and competitiveness in the EU, which is crucial. We have structural and cohesion funds for solidarity. If we are using these funds for road, rail and environmental infrastructure, we could and should use them for the development of research infrastructure as well. It is crucial that we create conditions in which researchers from the new Member States will remain in these countries and compete and cooperate with others in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Simplification and streamlining should be the name of the game, otherwise we will have major problems. I am aware of all the challenges ahead of me and I count on your support. The Commission is not the only body involved: I have created a taskforce in my directorate. We now also have an inter-service task force. We are now organising sounding boards among SMEs and smaller groups, to give them a chance to voice their opinions on the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Framework programmes, research and development structures, cohesion programmes, and competitiveness and innovation programmes are crucial. These should seek to achieve the same goals. That is one of the points I would especially like to underline.</p>
<p class="contents">For smaller users, we are trying to establish better definitions for the instruments, which are often far from user-friendly, especially the integrated projects. On the other hand, simplification and streamlining are major problems for smaller users. For them, costs are proportionally much higher and burdens are greater than they are for the bigger users. I believe these two things will be crucial. We should bring more SMEs into the process itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that the talks on the next financial perspective will be a kind of moment of truth. I hope that we will be strong enough to reach conclusions which tally with the Commission's proposal. I am afraid that if certain changes are made the structure of the budget will be worse than it is now. Thank you for your support.</p>
