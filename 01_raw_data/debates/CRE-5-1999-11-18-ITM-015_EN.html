This is a very important report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like to quote some figures so that you have an idea of the scale of the drug trade. First, we are dealing with the drug trade that in the meantime represents 8% of the volume of trade and makes billions in profits at the expense of young people and our families. Within the European Union we annually seize some 600 tonnes of cannabis. As far as the consumption of drugs is concerned, it is a fact that as many as 5 million young people take synthetic drugs and some 20% have tried cannabis. The legal position in Europe is extremely unsatisfactory. In the eyes of the citizens of Europe the battle against drug crime should be treated as an absolute priority. I therefore believe that Marietta Giannakou’s report is especially important and the action plan is something really fundamental that can help us in this field. It contains broad strategies, from prevention to repression to reintegration. It does not allow for any liberalisation or legalisation and sets priorities and brings domestic and foreign policy together in order to be able to combat drugs successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">These are ambitious goals, but in reality it will not be easy, as up to now it has not been possible to obtain comparable data for individual Member States and to compare the methods and as long as we do not have this comparison of methods and dates it will also not be possible to achieve ‘best practice’ as a model. Prevention has little support and the youth programmes are not designed for support in combating drugs. The European Union makes relatively little money available.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the feasible and absolutely essential demands that we must make? The first thing for me is that it is vital for the prevention policy to be intensified. I can see that there is quite a good chance of us attempting on a voluntary basis to declare schools as drug-free areas, to make it clear to schoolchildren through education that a life without drugs should be their main goal. We therefore need the support of the European Union programmes such as SOCRATES and LEONARDO.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must urge the Member States most emphatically that we should finally obtain a standardised system of data and method registration so that it is possible to find the best models in the battle against drugs We must encourage cooperation between the police and the judiciary in the countries of Europe in the battle against drug crime and to protect young people. We must make the European Union programmes such as FALQONE, GROTIUS or OISIN more productive, organise them more efficiently and make more funds available.</p>
<p class="contents">So with the action plan we have a good programme. It is, however, a matter of getting to work on turning this programme into action in the battle against drugs and for young people and for a drug-free society as a whole. That must be the aim, even if it is very difficult to achieve.</p>

<p class="contents">Friday morning in Strasbourg is the day when there is the most pressure. Tomorrow the plenary sitting will be bursting with Members crowding in to vote on the Giannakou report. If there are fifty, that will be a lot. I venture to make this comment because it is a glaring contradiction to the other assertion that Mrs Giannakou’s report is so important and it should therefore absolutely be discussed and voted on this week. There is no logic behind that.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, our colleague’s report is an important report and must be discussed very carefully, among other reasons because the debate on the report has once again shown that drugs policy in the European Union is one of the most controversial subjects that we have ever had to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all address a comment to the rapporteur. I believe that Mrs Giannakou has taken a lot of trouble to give an opinion on the action plan in a form that was geared to a consensus and was determined in such a way as to integrate the different ways of looking at the situation that not only go right through the political “families” but are also characterised by national traditions, by different factors and by partially conflicting interests. So our Group wishes to thank the rapporteur most warmly.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say on behalf of my absent colleague Jan Andersson, who as a Swedish Member of Parliament – I shall speak about that again in a minute – was in a very difficult position, because Sweden is one of the Member States that has a very special approach to drugs policy, owing to its national experience and national tradition and which despite this I believe, as you do, Mrs Giannakou, with the compromise amendments have ensured that this report is actually structured in such a way that it will receive broad approval.</p>
<p class="contents">128 amendments were submitted and you finally formulated 17 or 18 compromise amendments that should help to focus this profusion of amendments so that in the end a logical and conclusive report by the Parliament emerges on this action plan. The words “logical” and “conclusive” really mean that three essential aspects have to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, all of us, whether on the right or left of this House must be clear and I do believe that the approach to drug policy must start from one premise: drug addicts do not on principle need punishment and persecution but help and support. That is really self-evident. Why do I have to mention that again here? Because the way in which we help these people to reintegrate into society, the way in which we reduce their personal, individual suffering must derive from specific regional, local and national experiences. So there cannot be an officially prescribed European drugs policy but there must be a European framework within which help can be provided to the people affected who are the focus here, on the basis of the specific experiences of the local and regional authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is that in our drugs policy we must bear in mind that in hardly any other branch of crime in Europe is more money earned than in the drug trade. That means that we can talk about reducing the supply, which is a very important factor but it still means that those people who supply drugs on the market must be pursued regardless. For this we need criminal law and the police. But we also need a factor that I feel has not been touched on adequately in the debate. Those people who deal in drugs generally do so if it is on a large scale, intending to make a profit and to enrich themselves. Everywhere we succeed in preventing illegal income from drug dealing from being converted into legal income, we have made great progress, that is to say, the battle against the drug trade and money laundering are phenomena that are linked. Policy on combating drugs – I address this to the Commissioner for internal security – therefore means that by reducing the supply there will be the resulting prosecution of the drug dealer, particularly in the area of money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the third and final aspect, with which I will conclude. We all have different experiences. In one country in the European Union there is a rather permissive approach, in another a rather restrictive one. Overall if we consider the results of the Drug Monitoring Centre in Lisbon – almost everywhere there is an equally high drugs rate. This means that whatever the approach we adopt at present we are equally successful or unsuccessful. This means that we should set the parameters at a European scale and that implementation should be subsidiary and based on the respective national experiences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By and large, there are three shades of opinion discernible in this House. Firstly, the followers of the Swedish model which, apart from treating drug addicts, emphasises the control of narcotics. Secondly, there are the followers of the Dutch model, which tends more towards the treatment of drug addicts than control. The Dutch model which allows drug shops, which in the Netherlands are given the unfortunate English term “coffee shops”, presupposes a division between soft drugs, namely marihuana, and hard drugs, such as heroin and ecstasy.</p>
<p class="contents">These two groups, the followers of the Swedish model and those of the Dutch model, do not want too much European cooperation in this field because they fear that their national policy might be affected. Alongside these two groups, there is a third trend represented in this Parliament, namely those who do advocate more extensive and intensive European cooperation in the drugs policy, so that the various approaches which I have described above can grow towards each other. This means that countries like France and Germany should do more to treat their drug addicts but that a country like the Netherlands, for example, should focus on controlling the drugs nuisance created by the “coffee shops” and on drugs tourism. </p>
<p class="contents">These three trends are also represented in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. I am therefore pleased to say that most of my group colleagues can vote in favour of Mrs Giannakou’s report. We find it an interesting report which fortunately disregards the issue of legalising narcotics and looks at the measures to be taken by the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">On 6 November last, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, advocated stronger European cooperation in the field of drug control. He did this further to reports of Italian youngsters using ecstasy which largely originated from my country, the Netherlands. Mr Prodi’s remarks caused a huge commotion in the Netherlands. I personally agree with Mr Prodi. If the European Union is intent on dealing with transnational crime forcefully, then this should also include the control of drug trafficking. In fact, that is Europol’s first task. Ecstasy is a hard drug which is lethal, as recent events in Italy have shown. </p>
<p class="contents">Those supporting the legalisation of soft drugs should also be open to European cooperation. Indeed, a Member State could not legalise drugs on its own, this could only be done at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present report drafted by Mrs Giannakou is not exactly a shining example of this clarity. The debate is not being conducted in a very level-headed way. There is too much bellicose rhetoric and frankly, too much hullabaloo.</p>
<p class="contents">We have noticed that slowly but surely this House has made some prudent steps in the right direction when it comes to dealing with this complex issue. This is certainly evident if we compare the present debate and text with those of a couple of years ago. At that time, hellfire and damnation were not punishment enough for Members who dared mention the words harm reduction or a therapeutic approach. To most people in this House, it was completely inconceivable that, apart from a repressive approach to the drugs policy, other, more effective strategies could also be developed. </p>
<p class="contents">The Giannakou report represents a clear improvement on a number of points. It recognises the importance of urban and regional policy experiments, refers to <span class="italic">harm reduction</span> and is prepared to evaluate different pluralistic therapeutic approaches. Not very revolutionary and only a small step forward. But it gives cause for hope that bad practices can be compared on the basis of accurate data and that a humane and effective drugs policy will become a likelihood in an integrated European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The way in which these positive elements are formulated, however, leaves too much scope for opposing interpretations. Positive developments evident from the text cannot compete with the repressive mood which is still prevailing. Think, for example, of the enforced rehabilitation of drug addicts in prisons. This leads to inhumane situations and is not very effective if not taken on board out of one’s own free will. </p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the aid policy should not be restricted to achieving total abstinence in the long run. One can live with drugs, as is the case – to many people’s delight – with alcohol and tobacco and as is the case with Prozac and Valium. Does the rapporteur’s ferocious war declaration apply here too? After all, research has shown that a good joint is less harmful and addictive than some socially accepted drugs. </p>
<p class="contents">Possibilities other than rehabilitation are still not mentioned in this report, although it is established practice in more and more Member States to supply drugs in a controlled manner, sometimes with very promising results. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is of the opinion that a fatalistic outlook encourages drug abuse. This is a fallacy intended to sharpen the senseless war against drug abuse. It exacerbates marginalisation and crime and will lead to more crime. It is a repressive instrument which, unlike the addict, profits from this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had of course heard that there were such things as drugs, but they were substances we were unfamiliar with and had never encountered. It was said however that some people got their doctors to supply them with substances they would otherwise not have had access to. Nor did we have open borders. We had no traffic from Third World countries, and nor did we have very much money so, even if the supply of drugs had been there, we would not, I am sure, have been able to buy them. The main point, however, was that we did not see any need for them. Today, the world looks rather different. It is open, and the Schengen Agreement has opened the borders between our countries to such a degree that we do not have much opportunity to exercise supervision. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact which has to be faced is that the criminal forces which are involved in the manufacture and trading of drugs have a network, resources and powers which have far overtaken the constitutional states’ ability to stop the drugs traffic. That is why there is a need for a Community policy for, in the situation in which the European Union finds itself, we must necessarily work together to combat cross-border crime. </p>
<p class="contents">The report we have before us is quite excellent in what it says on a number of matters, and it points out with some clarity that, if we do not step up the war against the drug barons and financiers and their money laundering, then the constitutional states, our populations and our youth will lose out in this war. But the report also contains forms of words which were voted through by the Committee and which must look perfectly harmless, especially to those unfamiliar with these matters. They are concepts like harm reduction. And who would not want to reduce harm; who would not want to help people overtaken by a form of suffering as serious as drug dependency. Naturally, we all of us want to, and what we immediately think about in this connection is treatment, which is to say efforts involving a variety of social and medical provisions. But that is not what in fact lies behind the concept. Harm reduction means something quite different in the mouths of those who do not want to see a strict drugs policy pursued. May I say that I am completely at a loss to understand that philosophy, for drug abuse is not nowadays an isolated problem, affecting only the socially needy. I am well aware that it affects people who feel isolated or who are in social need, but these in fact constitute only a few of the people who today are victims of drug abuse. What our problem today is, is that young people, who may have good home lives, at the same time feel that their lives are so empty that they need an extra lift or trip on Saturday at the discotheque and to have their mood raised with the help of a drug they are lured into believing is harmless. </p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I cannot refrain from saying that I think that the speech which Mrs Buitenweg made here a moment ago is dangerous. I think it is dangerous for young people because it tempts them into believing – and I quote her – that “one can live with drugs, as is the case with alcohol and tobacco”. I am well aware that you can become dependent upon tobacco. It also takes a relatively large number of years before you get lung cancer from it. I am well aware that you can become dependent upon alcohol, and I also know that there are people who lose their lives through alcohol abuse. However, there is a crucial difference in the case of tobacco and alcohol because, in the vast majority of cases, it is possible for people to control their use of these substances to a different degree than young people who have got mixed up in drug abuse are able to control their use of drugs. I therefore want to say that it is important that, in the work that is being done within the EU, we give a very central place to having an information campaign for young people, who may today all too easily be enticed by friends of their own age and by others to try substances which are presented to them as being harmless and as things no worse to take than an extra glass of beer or an extra little whisky. It is in fact something different we are talking about here, and it has not become dangerous because it is forbidden; rather, it is forbidden because it is dangerous. So let us get away from this nonsense about decriminalisation and this tendency to trivialise the whole problem area by closing our eyes to the criminals who exploit our young people and destroy their health. </p>
<p class="contents">My group is a keen participant in the work which has been taking place in the Committee, and I should like to thank Mrs Giannakou for the sterling work she has done in this connection. We do not consider that, with the report we have before us and with what it contains, the definitive and best outcome has been obtained, and we very much hope that the Commissioner will be able to find still more effective and more powerful methods of combating this alarming misuse of drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission does the same in its plan of action. It has opted for a two-pronged approach: to control and prevent the demand for drugs and call for a hard-line approach regarding the supply of drugs. </p>
<p class="contents">Over the past couple of months, the drugs issue has been in the limelight rather a great deal. The Tampere Summit underlined once more that the problem in Europe should be approached in a comprehensive manner. The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, indicated last week that an “internal market for the trade in drugs” has come about in the Union. He claimed that this clearly calls for coordination of policy, even legislative harmonisation within those countries which, on account of their diverging policy, are playing into the hands of the trade. Given the many irritated Dutch reactions, this remark really hit home. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, Mr Prodi denied that he was talking about the Netherlands. Alas, my country does not only have the dubious honour of being known as a transit country for drugs, it is now also building itself a reputation for producing synthetic drugs. Several young people have since died of the effects of these synthetic drugs. This is really scandalous! I would urge Mr Prodi to call a spade a spade; the Netherlands is one of those countries that play into the hands of the trade on account of its diverging policy. </p>
<p class="contents">I can certainly see the benefits of the Dutch policy. For example, the care for addicts is excellent. On the demand side, many sound initiatives have been developed. But this serves little purpose if we continue to be blinkered regarding the supply side. It is about time that the Netherlands draws up a balance sheet; at international and European level, the Dutch policy does not fit in and creates problems. So time then for a change of course. It so happens that cooperation at European level is aimed at constructive confrontation. For this purpose, the plan of action is offering some useful instruments. Let us undertake this challenge as a matter of priority! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore impossible to determine to what extent the objectives laid down have been met. </p>
<p class="contents">Given that we are talking about the fight against drugs, the Commission’s Communication is not included on the agenda of the Court of Auditors or even OLAF, but on Parliament’s agenda. Therefore, illogically, you are preparing to reconfirm the previous plan’s strategies for the next five years. </p>
<p class="contents">You will all agree – right as well as left – because when we discuss drugs you restrict yourselves to having simple differences of opinion, and no group is brave enough to put forward alternative strategies. Indeed, when drugs are under discussion, the vast majority of you renounce your role as a government Member who, when faced with a problem, takes a lead on the issue and tries to resolve it, and, if the solution does not provide positive results or is counterproductive, as in this case, adopts a different policy. </p>
<p class="contents">You do not want to examine the possibility of changing the prohibitionist policy on drugs, because, when it comes to political choices, you impose moral convictions and beliefs which are a matter for each individual’s conscience. In short, on this subject, you prevent true, scientific, secular debate by choosing an ethical approach which proves to be frustrating, ineffective and disastrous: disastrous because you try to justify things with the lack of financial resources. But how much would it cost to eliminate drug trafficking, a trade that the United Nations says accounts for 8% of world trade? You refuse to carry out a cost-efficiency assessment because you would have to admit that with your policy you have handed over control of the production and trade in certain substances to a criminal monopoly. </p>
<p class="contents">None of this surprises me: during this century crazy and incomprehensible things such as Nazism, Fascism and Communism have managed to gain power. Prohibition of drugs still remains: ethical, inhuman and anti-scientific madness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a firm drugs policy. Thanks are due to all who have contributed to formulating it including, naturally enough on this particular day, the rapporteur Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, but also Sir Jack Stewart-Clark who has worked with these questions in previous years. </p>
<p class="contents">May I perhaps emphasise that it is rather striking that I in particular, as a Swede, am very impressed indeed by this Parliament’s ability to produce what I consider to be a firm drugs policy. In fact, we Swedes have a fairly definite view of these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can now count upon seeing good results in the field of drugs policy. I am particularly pleased that it is the Group of the European People’s Party’s drugs programme which in fact forms the basis of the present compromise. There are features which will mean that we embark upon a common road towards fewer drugs and with the goal of leading both society and individuals away from drugs and towards the long-term goal of a society without drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Once these measures which are now being proposed have taken effect, I believe that there will emerge in the Member States a greater sympathetic understanding of the differences between their respective policies. It is therefore important that it should be precisely that policy which is the best policy which should stand as an example. I should therefore like to urge the Commission to ensure in particular that the new Member States also have the opportunity to be present when the project is devised. In my own country, many people, it is true, feel rather discriminated against in this area. If we are bad at carrying out projects, we should like to improve. We should, however, also like to be present when assessments of on-going projects are carried out so that we might see which road the European Union will continue to go down.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we should comply with the laws of the different countries. We cannot, in this European Union, step into some kind of grey area of a community governed by law and not comply with our legislation. If we do not want to comply with our legislation, we must change our legislation and not pursue some kind of policy which does not follow the rules of a State governed by law. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you for the efforts which have been made and urge us all to be very much more committed in the future. We are not there yet by any means. Rather, there is a very great deal of work which remains to be done. Unfortunately, many of the amendments on the table here in this Chamber place obstacles in the way, so I hope that many of them will be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unlike my colleagues from the Netherlands, Mr Wiebenga and Mr Blokland, I am proud of the Dutch policy. A hard-line approach on hard drugs, including XTC, is, at the same time, an effective way of lifting victims from the criminal circuit via a health-care approach and is also a policy which, fortunately, is attracting more and more followers elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the logic behind it? The rationale? One may well wonder following this discussion. What we have before us is the product of a long and emotionally-laden process and we have not finished by a long way because we are about to vote on this, that is tomorrow morning at 9.00 a.m. </p>
<p class="contents">What is the issue? The Commission has made an announcement regarding a European Union plan of action concerning drug control for the years 2000 to 2004. Compared with a previous plan of action, this document is clearly a step forward. We are now on track for a kind of mainstreaming of the drugs policy with the emphasis on prevention, but hardly any guiding choices are being made. Instead of making choices, we have mainly looked at the fantasy image of what avenues would be open to us once the war against drugs is over. Until such time, until we have won this war and our society is free from drugs, we are conducting an uncompromising battle against not only the drugs Mafia but also the poor coca farmers in Latin America and also the poppy planters in Asia. The militarisation of these societies, together with the fact that these poor people are not being given any effective help, means there are no truly sustainable prospects for the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Is it not about time we drew up a cost-benefit analysis of what we are doing, which is in fact at the insistence of the US war on drugs? Are drugs really at least as important as human rights, as suggested by the rapporteur, and why do we not learn from an effective approach as adopted in the Netherlands, for example? Luckily, further to the Commission’s communication, we are making some room for users and some more room for potential users, young people, by pointing out the harmful effects. </p>
<p class="contents">All in all this still has very little bearing on reality. After all, the Commission has repeatedly highlighted that the plan of action in this respect is merely a supplement. Perhaps it is so that the call made to the Presidency for an inter-pillar council could be seen as signalling a new opportunity, because this document still feels like a missed opportunity to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I belong to a growing minority in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and also in this House which believes a radical change to our approach may be needed. Why? Quite apart from the ethical flaw in the prohibitionist argument – the state has no right to prevent a responsible adult from taking drugs – the fact is that prohibition is not working. Our approach, which is based on controlling the supply of drugs, is using up massive resources. The police in Bristol in my constituency tell me that 85% of all crime is drug-related. This is destroying our inner cities, where drug dealers find a large market and sometimes even become role models for disenchanted young people. It is filling our prisons with people who need care rather than incarceration, and it discriminates disproportionately against ethnic minorities, some of which have cultures in which drug abuse is less frowned upon than in others. But, more importantly, it is helping to fund other forms of criminal activity and strengthening international organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We need at least to consider switching resources away from attacking the supply of drugs and towards attacking demand.</p>

They desperately need help. I therefore feel that it is very important to undertake an honest analysis of the results of the programme and to draw the necessary conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims of this drug control programme are first and foremost to reduce the supply and demand. Neither of these aims has been achieved. Irrespective of the age group, country and drug concerned, drug taking is increasing or stagnating despite the harsh penalties and much greater number of prosecutions at national and increasingly at European level. The same applies to the reduction in the supply of drugs. For a long time only 10% of the drug trade has been caught by the police. These shattering results are hushed up. Instead, the drug programme before us just contains a copy of the previous programme with cosmetic changes. Fortunately the Commission is undertaking an evaluation. However, an external assessment would clearly be better on this sensitive subject. In any case, the appropriate action will have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the lack of success of the programme, a large part of the financial resources in the context of the drug programme goes into combating drugs. For anything that is aimed at minimising the damage, there is a very small amount left over. The question remains, however, why this programme is not clearly aiming to achieve the hidden goals. We cannot escape the conclusion that the very fact of this programme’s existence is all that matters, and that in fact it serves different aims to those that have been stated. What does this mean? The drug programme is used to increase the legitimacy of the EU. Drug programmes therefore have a purely instrumental character. And because that is at the expense of the addicts, we urgently need to think again.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no ideal solution in drug policy, we all agree on that. But action must be taken. The urgent aim must be to minimise the damage and that must be firmly established in the drug programme. What that means in practice I shall show in four demands with which I shall now conclude.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, supply should be reduced to the minimum. Secondly, methadone programmes should be expanded in the EU and the tried and tested controlled practice of the handing in of heroin should be introduced. Thirdly, drugs users should be able to test drugs for their content and mixture. Only in this way can further damage be prevented; we therefore need EU-wide drug checking. Fourthly, city cooperation should be promoted, taken from the idea of the European Cities Drug Policy<span class="italic"> </span>as a prime example of a project that recognises – legal and illegal – drugs as belonging to society and lends support to people dealing responsibly with these drugs. We urgently need such a drug programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But a world without unhealthy stimulants is an unattainable utopia. Two groups of people are attracted to these: adults who, because of the free market, are at the mercy of social insecurity and tension and young people who want to explore all that is risky and forbidden. Strict centralised European rules banning the use of drugs and regulating prosecution do not solve this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Small-scale projects for the support of addicts, including training, housing, employment and income and also the provision of information regarding the effects of drug abuse are much more important. I am somewhat alarmed at President Prodi’s recent announcement that small-scale, customised solutions will be prohibited in future. In the Netherlands, the use of soft drugs has been permitted for the past twenty years. This safeguards the users against sliding into crime and hard-drug addiction and offers the best chance of returning to a life without drugs. This important public-health measure has since been adopted in many towns and regions in other European states. It would be bad management to ban this policy, which can be held up as an example, in the name of European unification. As far as I am concerned, Mr Prodi’s statement is actually an important reason why I would reject this proposal out of hand, despite all the balanced views contained in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I must confess that I am no fundamentalist where this matter is concerned and I respect those who hold different opinions. I particularly respect the opinion that has just been expressed by Mr Watson, whom I hold in great esteem.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do not believe that in the name of efficiency, we can lay aside principles, and I shall start with such just such a matter of principle: we believe that drugs are an evil that must be fought. They are a vice that weakens the will, which ensnares the individual in a dependency which enslaves and depersonalises him or her, which destroys social bonds and relationships, which creates delinquency and makes society less safe, and which sustains world-wide criminal networks that defy States’ power and law. </p>
<p class="contents">We think that it is obvious that we have to wage an uncompromising war against drugs. This message is clearly made in Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou’s report and deserves our applause. Indeed, this is a problem of this day and age and is extremely worrying. We know that drugs affect all countries and all social classes, and we also know that Europe’s enlargement towards the East dramatically shows the urgent need for efficient measures now that monitoring, which is already difficult, is going to become even more difficult. We know that this is a growing problem. According to the report by the European Monitoring Centre, cannabis is still the most widely consumed drug throughout the European Union, although it is heroin that causes the most problems in terms of requests for treatment, drug-related deaths, HIV infection and social exclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">The same report, furthermore, shows an increase in the consumption in Europe of new synthetic drugs such as ecstasy, as well as an increase in the consumption of more traditional drugs such as LSD and amphetamines. And all of this becomes more frightening if we consider that, at the moment, drug-related crime and the scale of drug trafficking represent around 8% of world trade. </p>
<p class="contents">We agree that this problem must be tackled from three angles: by reducing demand, by controlling drug trafficking and by combating drug addiction. We agree that public awareness campaigns must be implemented and, at the same time, that we must strengthen prevention networks. In the area of treatment, we must give support to high-quality programmes aimed at the whole community, using educational methods, including those targeting the prison population, together with initiatives designed to promote the reduction of risk, one example of which is the needle exchange programme. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to reducing the availability of drugs, we must continue and increase our support to producing countries, so that they include in their priorities the reduction of demand and programmes for destroying crops, the destruction of laboratories and the prevention of trafficking. For this reason, the political will required by this report must become reality. If we limit ourselves to fine words, the conclusion will have to be that there has not been the political will. This can be measured by the efficiency of the actions and the public resources placed in the service of this fight. The report highlights the fact, and rightly so, that the budgetary resources are inadequate. This Parliament does not have the right to ask the Member States for greater commitment and greater investment in the fight against drugs if it does not lead by example on an issue for which it has responsibility. The main European instrument in this struggle is the European Monitoring Centre in Lisbon. We expect a great deal from its work, in terms of a better understanding of the phenomenon, in terms of the existence of data and comparable information, and, above all, in terms of monitoring, identifying and proposals to ban dangerous substances placed on the market. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why we proposed amendments to this report. They were, in essence, accepted and seek to strengthen the role of the Monitoring Centre and to provide it with the necessary financial means for its work. The other thing that our citizens are asking from us here is clarity. Giving fine speeches is not enough. We must take decisions and release resources which correspond to the commitment that we claim to have in this vital fight against organised crime for the sake of human dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This plan covers all aspects of the problem and opens new prospects for a more mainstream, efficient approach. However, and this goes without saying, more resources are needed. I would like to congratulate Mrs Giannakou on her highly substantive report, especially the emphasis on international collaboration and the introduction of a systematic, yearly inter-pillar Council meeting to improve the monitoring and evaluation of action intended mainly to reduce the supply of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the international agreement concluded by the Special Session of the United Nations Organisation in June 1998 for a balanced approach to the problem which aims to reduce both supply and demand, I would like to highlight the potential offered by Article 152 of the Treaty. This article allows the Union to complement national policies with action directed towards improving public health, preventing illness and reducing drugs-related damage to health. The European Union action plan for the period from 2000 to 2004 must therefore include, over and above what is mentioned in the report, practices and programmes directed towards breaking the habit and restricting damage to the health of drug users.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we need to focus our attention on and give priority funding to programmes to evaluate practices aimed at prevention, treatment and reintegration and in connection with the consequences to society and public health, so that Member States and applicant countries can use the conclusions as a guide when deciding their national policy. Finally, I would like to point out that the European monitoring centre in Lisbon is carrying out important work and I trust that the information and data collected by it will prove how efficient European and international collaboration has been in this difficult fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the drug problem, not only on a European level but also on a world level, requires the special attention of politicians, institutions and the whole of civil society. On 26 October, in this Parliament, the President of Colombia, a country which unfortunately has strong links with the drug problem, told us: “Drug trafficking has been the great creator of violence and has led to assassinations of the highest possible human cost to our country”. And we are not talking here about an issue which only affects the Member States nor the European Union, but an issue which directly affects human beings in any country of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first concern in this Parliament should be to point out that the responsibility is collective, that it requires collaboration, cooperation and coordination between the judicial and penal authorities and between the different continents, whether they be the European Union, Latin America, South East Asia or African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concern is that the European Union must play a greater role in the field of reducing the demand for drugs. To this end, the European Parliament, in this resolution, has highlighted and strengthened the role which the European Observatory on Drugs and Drug Addiction must play by giving it greater means and resources to fulfil its objective efficiently. I would like particularly to stress the importance of the fight against traffickers who use and exploit illegal immigrants, especially on the Southern border of Europe, in Andalucia, Ceuta and Melilla, which have become a channel for drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to dedicate the third consideration to the group which is most affected by this social scourge; our young people. A recent survey carried out in my country indicated that the second greatest social problem in the eyes of our young people was, after unemployment, the drug problem. As the resolution says, drugs give rise to family problems, work problems and road accidents. If we add to this the considerable increase which has been observed in the consumption of alcohol by young people, which in many cases goes hand in hand with drug-taking, especially synthetic drugs, we can see the need to adopt urgent measures which will reverse this trend. Action in the field of education and families, economic cooperation with associations and NGOs, especially in the field of leisure and sport, will complement the actions which must banish this “pressure valve” from the lives of our young people which sometimes means that they are destroyed by something which starts out as a means of escape.</p>
<p class="contents">But we cannot solve these problems by talk alone. Resources are required. Both the Member States and the European Union itself must prioritise, in their budgets, the economic means which will allow the implementation of the measures proposed, including prevention, suppression and rehabilitation. And unfortunately this is still not the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my part of Europe 3 million people are on illegal drugs, that includes 28% of 16-29 year-olds and 14% of 14-15 year-olds. 12,000 new, notified addict cases come each year; we have 70,000 drug offenders a year and we lose 1,200 people through drug-related deaths per year. This is a battle which we may not be winning now, but which we must not lose. We need a multi-pronged policy, we need to act together to stop the growers and the traders and the pushers, but we also need policies on education and health and we need to encourage research. If we simply cut the supply and not the demand, then we will end up with a higher price for the drugs on the street and with more crime being committed to pay for people's habits.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments to this report before us are therefore right. We need to educate young people. We need role models from music and fashion and film to get the message across to young people: not just by saying "no", that does not work, but by telling them the truth. The truth is that drugs can bring pleasure but also the truth is that they can damage health. Damage in the form of cancer and heart disease, in memory and concentration loss, testicular problems and so on, and young people need to understand that, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Drug-taking is wrong, but we need to help those who are willing to accept help. I shall never forget, as a minister responsible for fighting drugs, going and meeting a young man who had lost his health and his friends and his relationships, his family, his jobs, his prospects and his self-respect. He was being helped to help himself come out of that deep black hole of addiction. I stupidly asked him "Do you feel you are beating it yet?" and he said to me "I have a lifetime struggle ahead of me – if I ever think that I have beaten it, then I am lost". He deserves our support. He needs the research to make sure that we have effective treatments and we need to give him that help and that confidence. But how much better if we could destroy this evil by persuading future generations of young people that it is simply not for them; it is simply not worth taking the risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Italian delegation, too, we wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, on her excellent work. As many Members have reminded us, we are dealing with the difficulty of finding a balance, which, nevertheless, has been achieved. The difficulty stems from the different experiences and policies of the Member States. At the same time, we must also initiate different types of relations between the Union as a whole and the activities of the individual states, and between the principle of subsidiarity and the need – which has also, rightly, been expressed – for the Union to equip itself with a common policy on this phenomenon which is a real concern for our present, but also for our future.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of values, I am convinced of this and I totally agree with the ideas expressed by Mr Coelho, and therefore I will not repeat them. Frankly, I am uneasy listening to some positions that send this message to young people: get used to living with ecstasy, get used to living with valium, i.e. get used to a life full of drugs. I refuse to accept that politics should give way upon this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">I said that the report is excellent, not just because it rightly puts the two elements of the matter back into the spotlight – a combined action to reduce demand and to reduce supply – but also, may I say, because of the frankness with which Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou criticises what is still insufficient in the Commission proposal, both from a financial and economic point of view – we cannot state the importance of a battle and then not follow through in financial terms – and from the point of view, shall we say, of the political half-heartedness regarding the initiatives that the States still have not made. Therefore, this excellent idea to convene an “inter-pillar” Council is one we should support. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would just like to emphasise two points that, in our experience as Italians, are particularly important and significant: firstly, the importance of supporting basic scientific research as well so that we gain a greater understanding of the phenomenon, and, if possible, receive early warning of what the alleged drugs of the future will be, especially finding out the devastating effects of synthetic drugs; secondly, the importance of involving in these actions those principally concerned, those who are in the front line every day, who help drug addicts, that is, the experiences of treatment centres. I think that these should be supported and encouraged. Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou willingly accepted this request from the Italian delegation. I think that, in future, when we address this subject again, it will be useful to come back to the point of who is managing and helping drug addicts today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
