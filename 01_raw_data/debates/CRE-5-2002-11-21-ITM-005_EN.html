I did not do this and I am also grateful to my fellow MEPs who were dissuaded from fighting this battle.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we not facing the battle? Because of the great importance of extending the regulation to include third-country nationals and due to the fact that something is finally being done about the legal position of those who reside legally in a European Member State but who subsequently, when they live or work elsewhere, have no rights whatsoever. The European Court of Justice has said several times that the coordination regulation should apply to these legally resident citizens as well. The Commission has submitted a directive, an amendment to a regulation, on this very subject. It chose to use a different legal basis but failed to get the Council to ratify it. I am indebted to the Commission, but also, as I have already stated, to my fellow MEPs, for deciding to turn their backs on envy and political squabbling and for opting, with good reason, to bring these citizens within the scope of Regulation 1408. I think that an institutional battle over what would have been the correct legal basis would have lasted for many years and would certainly not have benefited these people.</p>
<p class="contents">We as Parliament have therefore seized the earliest opportunity – and I believe that the Council of Ministers will be taking a decision on 3 December next – to establish the rights of these citizens – their duties have already been set out. The fact that the Danes and even the British felt they should be involved in this regulation filled me with particular joy. It will in any event also create clarity, which is desperately needed.</p>
<p class="contents">When the amendments will be adopted shortly, we <span class="italic">will</span> say to the Council that if further amendments are made to our opinion or if the legal position of the people concerned is changed, we will retain the right to join this institutional battle with the Council over these points. What we have included is just about acceptable, but in any event, it contains the serious warning that if things are not going as planned and as agreed, we will keep the avenue to the Court in Luxembourg open.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to thank all fellow MEPs who have worked on this system with great commitment and a great deal of dynamism and who, along with me, were prepared to support the Commission in this proposal. In addition, I should like to make an observation which concerns one of your officials, Mr Verschueren, who is at the moment unwell at home, but who, in my view, is the best spokesperson on behalf of the Commission on this subject matter. I should like to extend to him, via yourself, my warmest wishes for a very speedy recovery. I am certain that I am also doing this on behalf of the fellow MEPs who are working on this dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and the MEPs for the excellent report and for their support for the Commission proposal. It is an extremely important proposal and its adoption would be a significant political signal from the Union regarding the integration of third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union, since it offers them, in terms of social security, the same protection which Community citizens moving within the European Union enjoy. It is therefore a major contribution to a balanced, coherent Community immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On 27 October 1999, this House called for prompt action regarding the fair treatment of third-country nationals legally residing in the Member States, so that they might be granted rights similar to those enjoyed by citizens of the Union. The proposal in question responds to this call and goes even further, granting third-country nationals rights that are identical, and not just similar, to those enjoyed by Community citizens moving within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will also encourage worker mobility, the importance of which was illustrated by the Commission’s action plan presented at the start of the year. The proposal will therefore simplify the rules, reducing the number of national and international instruments which govern the coordination of social security systems for this category of people.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur rightly pointed out in her explanatory statement, this proposal for a regulation, based on Article 63(4) of the Treaty, aims to build a bridge. It simply extends the scope of Community regulations on social security to third-country nationals, regulations which are and will continue to be based on Article 42 of the Treaty. This means that, for any future amendments to Regulation 1408/71, Parliament will continue to be a codecision-maker.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission proposal already contains a recital which refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but I agree that there is a need for a specific reference to Article 34(2) of the Charter. The Commission is therefore able to support Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the assertion that the coordination of social security for third-country nationals is of great importance, but this is so obvious that it – and likewise a recital in this regard – is superfluous. The importance of coordinating social security systems for third-country nationals is already amply conveyed in the first nine recitals proposed by the Commission. While it agrees with the underlying concept, the Commission therefore cannot accept Amendment No 2.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that it is appropriate to refer to the forthcoming, imminent enlargement of the European Union in the recitals: the Commission can therefore accept Amendment No 3. It is, however, unable to support Amendments Nos 4 and 5. With regard to Amendment No 4, it must be said that it is inappropriate to refer in a regulation to a proposal for a Community instrument, the outcome of which is still unknown. The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 5 for a number of reasons. First of all, the aim of the proposal is to grant third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State the same rights as Community citizens moving within the Union. Amendment No 5 seeks to grant third-country nationals different rights to those given to Community citizens. I do not see why an Afghan or Indian worker, in the Netherlands or Finland for example, should have to face profoundly different problems – owing to unfamiliarity with the language and/or with the administrative procedures in the host country – from those faced by a Greek or Portuguese colleague.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also launch a vigorous information campaign and, once the proposal has been adopted, all those concerned will be made aware of it so that they can assert their rights when the time comes. Moreover, there is already a high degree of media interest in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I am extremely grateful to this House for having included the proposal on today’s agenda, thereby enabling the Council to formally adopt it at the meeting on 3 December. You will understand that the Commission does not have enough time to submit an amended proposal to the Council, but my fellow Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, intends to recommend that the Council adopts the proposal together with those of Parliament’s amendments which we have just accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gillig (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to join the rapporteur in welcoming the prospect of implementing such a legislative provision, i.e. a position on the substance of the draft text.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed it was high time, and the European Commission had a political responsibility towards the people affected by this draft regulation, particularly since the Tampere European Council in October 1999, which had established, in its conclusions, the need to take swift measures to ensure that nationals from third countries living legally in the European Union are treated equally.</p>
<p class="contents">What we welcome is the respect for equal treatment for residents of third countries with regard to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and the social equality resulting from it which, as has been said, provides quite substantial help towards integrating them but also encourages mobility. We are aware that this mobility, which we talk about so much, is much more difficult to put into practice than free movement of property and goods.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress, because it should be done, the important contribution that the residents of third countries make to the European Union, both in terms of boosting the economy and in terms of a rich cultural diversity and when we talk about them we are potentially talking about around 13 million people in the Union. That is not an insignificant number.</p>
<p class="contents">However, like the rapporteur, I would like to draw your attention to the issue of the legal basis chosen by the European Commission following pressure from the Council. The European Parliament had the consultation procedure imposed on it, whereas the first proposal in 1997 was based on Article 51, now Article 42, which assumes codecision. That decision, the motivation for which seems to be more than questionable, as pointed out by the rapporteur, and therefore contestable, in fact places the European Parliament in a dilemma, that it can only solve by giving in, because that is exactly what is happening here. And unfortunately, it is not the first time that there has been an attempt to genuinely dismantle, as we could describe it, the prerogatives of our institution, which could be seen as a dangerous precedent. I fear that there is an underlying trend, and I think that our institution will have to be vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, following the Council’s recommendations, knows full well that Parliament is going to choose the path of pragmatism, and that it will prefer to abandon what you, Madam, called, legal hair-splitting, in order not to endanger urgent Community legislation. We would not like to take responsibility for the failure of something that we desire.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not wish to cross swords, but the question is there: in the future, should we penalise the citizens who are awaiting decisions from this House simply in order to ensure that Parliament’s position is respected? I think that this decision, the quite reasonable position of the European Parliament, should be used to help discussions on matters that will arise in the future or that we know are already being considered by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We fully support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's approach, including the way she handled the legal basis. I think it important that agreements reached by way of European coordination now also apply to third-country nationals. Speaking quite honestly, it is a scandal that such was not already the case, in view of the fact that these people do indeed pay taxes and social security contributions, but then find themselves falling between two stools when working across frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already expressed its desire that the Tampere conclusions should be transposed into real action in a similar way as regards the rights of third-country nationals. The regulation that we are now discussing has to do with cross-border working, but the others, a naturally far larger category, also have to have their social rights secured in the same way as those of workers originating from the European Union. My group hopes that the struggle that must still be engaged in will lead to the necessary consensus being reached in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
