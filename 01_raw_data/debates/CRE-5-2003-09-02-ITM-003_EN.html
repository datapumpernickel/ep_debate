<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watts (PSE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the maritime sector is an important industry and employer in Europe. 40% of EU trade is already by sea or inland waterway. The vast majority of our trade with the rest of the world is by sea. Those of us who want to encourage the use of this more environmentally-friendly mode of transport welcome any action that encourages trade by sea. It is within this context that I, as your rapporteur, welcome the agreement on maritime transport between the European Community and the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">China is the EU's third largest trading partner outside Europe, which makes the Chinese market particularly important for European shipping interests. The growth of trade with China constitutes both an important boost to employment and an opportunity to further develop the maritime sector to ensure even more trade is by sea. In the past decade relations with China have developed in a positive way, particularly in respect of the maritime sector, with the majority of Member States signing bilateral agreements with the Chinese. The key aim of this proposal is to secure an EU-wide agreement to improve the conditions of maritime cargo transport operations concerning China and the EU. The agreement therefore applies to international maritime cargo transport on logistic services between the ports in China and the Member States and indeed international maritime cargo transport between the ports of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, as regards the ports and the use of infrastructure, each contracting party shall ensure non-discriminatory treatment of each other's vessels. The same principle shall apply in relation to fees, charges and customs formalities. The agreement is concluded for a period of five years and shall be tacitly reviewed on an annual basis. The agreement will only act as a substitute for the trade provisions of existing bilateral maritime agreements. I particularly welcome two important features of this agreement. Firstly, if this agreement is less favourable than the existing bilateral arrangements then the more favourable shall prevail. Secondly, I am very pleased that the Commission has indicated informally that it will assist companies that suffer discrimination, informally taking up these matters with the Chinese directly and therefore avoiding the potential of lengthy and costly litigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to personally thank the Commission for its assistance on that point. However, as the rapporteur, I have some concerns. This agreement with China also applies to vessels flying the flags of third countries but owned or operated by a shipping company of China or a Member State of the EU. In other words, we are potentially giving preferential access to flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">In the wake of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disasters, we must ask the Commission why the agreement seeks to provide the advantages of unrestricted access and non-discriminatory treatment to European or Chinese ship owners who choose to register their ships in third countries. I also regret the lack of formal consultation with the social partners, which could have addressed some of these concerns and made the agreement all the more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently I have tabled an amendment asking for the subsequent reviews – the annual reviews I have already referred to – to take this point into account. The amendment seeks to add a new paragraph 1a to the legislative resolution, which reads: 'Requests that the concerns regarding the recognition of third country flags within the scope of this agreement be evaluated in subsequent renewals.' The amendment does not seek, in any way, to inhibit any of the benefits for those on all sides of this agreement, but merely seeks to review this potential loophole.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as rapporteur, I welcome this historic EU maritime agreement with the People's Republic of China. It is a positive step in building ever-closer relations between Europe and China, an important boost for jobs and an important boost for those of us who want to see a renaissance of Europe's maritime trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I thank you for your understanding. For the third time we have changed the subject, and on behalf of the Commission and of Mrs de Palacio, for the same reasons as before, I should like to say that we completely approve, Mr Watts, the report that you have presented on the proposal for a Council decision concluding an agreement on maritime transport between the European Community and its Member States and the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we do have some doubts about the advisability of the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group, concerning the need to take into account, on the occasion of future revisions, its concerns about third-country flags in the context of this agreement. Although we are willing to accept this, as a valuable objective, it must not call into question the Union’s maritime foreign policy, which was defined a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this first agreement between two of the principal actors in the world maritime-transport market is particularly important, as you have reminded us, Mr Watts, not only because of the new economic and commercial outlets which are offered to the undertakings of both parties and the countries of which they are composed, but also because of the clear commitments contained in this agreement with a view to increased maritime cooperation, both at bilateral level and within international organisations such as the IMO or the ILO. Not only do these commitments relate to the continuation of our efforts in the area of maritime safety: they also provide new opportunities for action in the social field, and in training, as the European mission found when it went to China at the beginning of April to study the training schemes for seafarers and the certification of Chinese sailors.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that we intend to use this same approach with a view to concluding a maritime agreement with India, another major country in that part of the world. Mr President, Mr Watts, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the fact that the draft resolution approves the concluding of this agreement, and I hope, on behalf of the Commission, that maritime relations between the European Union and China will be encouraged and successful as a result. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This agreement is intended to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory treatment of European and Chinese shipping companies in each party’s respective ports and thus enable trade between the European Union and China to be carried on even more smoothly. This is all the more important in view of the fact that the People’s Republic of China is now already the European Union’s third largest trading partner.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement is important because it not only governs maritime cargo transport, including the intermodal transport associated with it, but also guarantees that wholly-owned subsidiaries can be founded in either State party to this agreement. Such subsidiaries shall be entitled, among other things, to employ key personnel irrespective of their nationality. I see this as amounting to a definite gain in terms of legal certainty for our European shipping companies.</p>
<p class="contents">You are probably just as well aware as many others among us that we have many agreements and dialogues with China, but that it is the local authorities – and that is what the port authorities are – who sometimes have other ways of doing things. It is for that reason that it is of quite crucial significance that we should now be concluding an agreement intended to secure non-discriminatory treatment in all Chinese ports for our European shipping companies. It is, of course, for the Commission to ensure that this agreement is promptly and properly implemented throughout China, and you, Commissioner, and also Vice-President, de Palacio, can perhaps say something about why this is so. This is particularly the case as regards the non-discriminatory use of port infrastructures and maritime services by European shipping companies in Chinese ports, but it also applies to the case of European shipping companies, who have to pay duties and charges, doing so in the same way as others, without being put at a disadvantage or discriminated against, and as regards customs formalities, which must not handicap our trade and our shipping companies in Chinese ports. We also appeal to the European shipping companies to come to us and to the Commission if there are problems, so that we can follow them up.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the amendment to the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Simpson and Mr Watts, the latter of whom and I know each other so well. This amendment is quite simply superfluous. In the course of the proceedings in committee, there was some correspondence with the Commission, which said what you, Mr Watts, have yourself confirmed, namely that this is an agreement for Europe’s and China’s shipping companies. What flags their ships sail under is a matter for them. This is a matter of international custom, and so you cannot behave as if European shipping companies’ use of the flags of third countries were a crime or something highly dangerous. The Commission itself has given assurances that it will see to it that European seafarers are not put to any disadvantage by this agreement. We trust the Commission. The amendment is superfluous! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group supports his work in all its aspects. It is true that the issue is an important one: half of all trade is, so to speak, on the water. China is indeed our third largest trading partner outside Europe, and its importance is growing tremendously fast, and up till now there has not been any agreement like this with China. It will apply to such areas as maritime cargo transport and logistics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that this principle of non-discrimination, which the previous speaker also discussed, as did the rapporteur, is now being supported through an agreement which also contains a measure for action to be taken in case of violation. This principle of non-discrimination is vital for us. Another important thing is that the agreement enables shipping companies to engage in business activity and establish their own companies, subsidiaries and representative offices. That is also an important breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">If a European shipping company feels that it is being discriminated against, it can appeal not just to its own but also to the European Union authorities. Obviously, this means a different sort of power altogether. This agreement means our position and our demands will gain strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Maritime transport needs a common system of regulation because the sector has become one of cheap labour and despicable, even criminal, activity. It is precisely for this reason that we need strict controls in the maritime transport sector. I would also like to ask how the Commissioner intends to deal with the flag of convenience issue when such incidents as that concerning the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> or other accidents occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
