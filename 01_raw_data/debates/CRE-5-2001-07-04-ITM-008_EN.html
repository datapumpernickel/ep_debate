<p class="contents">We know that there have been some discussions in budget areas of the Council which are aimed at introducing restrictions, but we take the view that at the present political time, it is right to approve the amounts originally envisaged in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an obvious reason for this: I think that having made it clear for so long that assistance would be available from the European Union if the people of Serbia and Montenegro threw off the yoke of dictatorship, we should keep our word. Particularly after the events of recent days, which have culminated in Milosevic’s extradition to the International Court Tribunal in The Hague, it is important that the European Parliament and the European Union signal that in response to these internal factors, the funds will be released, so that the people in a country like Yugoslavia can see that fostering democracy and human rights is genuinely worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Commissioner, conditions should be created so that this can happen as quickly as possible, and I know that this is your intention too.</p>
<p class="contents">This macro-financial assistance is not directly linked to a specific programme. It is an initial injection which is designed to help set things in motion. In this context, it should also be made clear that this assistance must not be tied to overly complicated conditions. We are proposing a number of amendments to you. These proposed amendments are designed to enhance control and also call for the involvement of other donors, although we do not view this as a condition. I believe that these are all positions which, ultimately, will not lead to obstacles and delay, but will enhance clarity, strengthen the control options, and also make it clear that we want assistance to be provided speedily.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this House did not create any difficulties when it was a matter of applying for urgent assistance for this area. As I am sure you recall, through the participation of other committees too, such as the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we signalled our willingness to proceed as quickly as possible and introduce the necessary amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also make one general political point. In recent years, we have repeatedly engaged in grand theoretical debates about the developments in Yugoslavia. Yet in terms of our commitment, whether in the field of prevention and civil crisis management or, indeed, through threats and the use of military capabilities, we have generally acted too late. Our policy has always been ‘too little, too late’. This has led us into the situation which we have witnessed in recent days in Macedonia. This misguided approach, which ultimately forces us to make even greater sacrifices and provide even more assistance – because we failed to act in time, and because we could not implement the concept of prevention and civil crisis management due to the international community’s total fragmentation of responsibilities in this region – has resulted in major political failure in key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">By providing these resources, we want to make it clear once again that this is not due to us, and that as the European Parliament, we are willing to do everything possible as quickly as possible. However, this is also an appeal to the Commission and the Council to make the necessary political decisions in a different way in future. I recall that two months ago, I was castigated and accused of being irresponsible when I spoke about the possibility of war in Macedonia. People ignore the facts for as long as they can, because they are too cowardly to tell the truth to the public at home. Afterwards, it all becomes far too expensive for everyone, and the costs again include human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we call urgently once again for rapid assistance to be provided so that peace, democracy and human rights can be restored to this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also required courage. During an earlier attempt to arrest Mr Milosevic, when he was still living in his own house, it was already evident that the army and the police were in opposite camps.</p>
<p class="contents">In a way, therefore, I think we should pay our respects to Mr Djindjic and the way he acted, although his motives may well have been inspired by opportunism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted that we have been able to agree internally on the fact that financial assistance should be subject to the extent to which steps are taken in the direction of rule of law, including cooperation with the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Parliament had a clearer take on this than the Council, which did not want to make this aid too conditional. In this respect, we share the position of the United States and I believe that that in itself was a very good move.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Milosevic has now been extradited by Serbia and Yugoslavia. All we need to do now is to wait for the international community itself to cooperate with the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The SFOR has to deliver the goods now, for the cooperation of SFOR and the political powers behind it, have so far been lacking. That is ultimately extremely painful and disgraceful. There is really no cause for any further complaint if SFOR fails to do what it should do in its own province, namely to arrest Messrs Karadzic and Mladic.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I would also appreciate it if the European Parliament’s message in this respect were driven home to the Council and to all those others who, under the United Nations, carry joint responsibility for the actions of the SFOR, of which we are right to have high expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the excellent services of Mr Korakas, we recently found out that we in Europe fail to see eye to eye in this respect. It appears that a vast majority in the Greek parliament has signed a declaration which states that it is very regrettable that Mr Milosevic has been taken to the so-called Court of Justice in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is a great deal to be done before the community of values with that parliament can be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that it is absolutely vital, given the country’s high level of debt, to provide an above-average level of lost subsidies here, i.e. above-average compared with the usual practice. I fully support the Commission on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">One condition for cooperation, as has been mentioned, is cooperation with The Hague. This has always been the position of this House and also our group. There is no question that a great deal has been achieved through Milosevic’s extradition. This is a positive development. Yet positive developments can sometimes leave a stale after-taste. Firstly, it was all too clear that Milosevic was handed over in exchange for the funds pledged by the donors’ conference, not so much in exchange for direct assistance from the European Union. It was not a pretty sight. There are two sides responsible: those who demanded this step, but also the government in Belgrade, who was too hesitant at first.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is interesting that particular pressure was applied by the Americans: the Americans, who persist in rejecting the notion that international courts could actually have jurisdiction over their citizens. This is an interesting point, and the European Union should bring pressure to bear on the Americans to recognise the international courts and their jurisdiction over American citizens at last.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it does not resolve the issue of Yugoslavia’s critical examination of its own history. There are many individuals, such as those responsible for the destruction of Vukovar, who are still at large. This debate must continue in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it is conceivable that the fragile balance established in Yugoslavia will undergo hard tests and could even be destroyed. On this point, I would like to make a comment about the future of the country. Over recent months and years, we have all witnessed what is often an antagonist mood towards Yugoslavia itself. Yet Yugoslavia has an important role to play in the region’s reconstruction, and thankfully, it now has responsible and sensible leaders who can set it on the right course.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must be patient here and help Yugoslavia fulfil its tasks in the region. Together with my group, I identify three key points in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the critical debate in Yugoslavia about events in the country over recent decades must continue. Secondly, there must be reconciliation with its neighbours. Here, in particular, the extradition of a number of war criminals would undoubtedly help. Thirdly, and this is my final point, the economy must certainly be reconstructed, and we must give our support to this process. If we are able to link these three elements together, we will be able to look back in five or ten years’ time on the successful history of EU policy in Yugoslavia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a long time, there were no relations. After October 2000, the EU promptly made EUR 200 million available to Yugoslavia by way of emergency aid. This just illustrates that even the EU can work quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the EU showed itself in its best light at the donor conference. We are now discussing here in Parliament macro-financial assistance to the tune of EUR 300 million to cover budget shortages, including a considerable gift in the sum of EUR 120 million. In my view, the assistance we are discussing this evening is representing the end of a certain era, namely the transition from autocracy to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This aid is welcome and appropriate at this stage, but in my opinion it also has the feel of a one-off gesture. It may also be useful to indicate that special conditions apply, of which I should like to mention two.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Brok has already stated, it is not the case that the approval and spending of these funds are subject to very special conditions, but sound cooperation must be established with the political and safety committee because the EU’s aid to Yugoslavia must be granted in a politically coherent fashion. That also applies to the assessment of that aid. Subsequent to this macro-financial assistance, it will have to be carefully examined, particularly on a political plane, if this form of aid is required in future.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has reached the conclusion that it is important for the EU to be quick off the mark, efficient and generous, whenever that is useful and needed politically speaking. It is about being able to transfer resources quickly and efficiently, not being afraid to take the lead and not being frightened to be dependent on other donors. But we must also be able to change strategy quickly and efficiently. That is why, in my view, it is important to support this kind of aid in the anticipation that it will probably be the last time that aid will be granted to Yugoslavia in this form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support the Commission’s proposal and the report. I do not think there is any need to repeat several of Mr Swoboda’s criticisms which I agree with. Mr Brok’s remarks about the need for a preventive peace policy and civil crisis management render my own outline comments superfluous. Of course, it is quite correct to say that far more rapid and concerted action is required. However, I believe that there are also very different sides to this policy which have various drawbacks. Mr Brok, in your proposed Amendment No 2, you state – quite rightly, in my view – that financial support can be provided to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as far as it proceeds towards a well-functioning legal state, including cooperation with the International Court Tribunal in the Hague. However, if at the same time a violation of rule-of-law principles is extorted, in effect, above all by the USA but apparently also by the German Chancellor, this policy is more likely to discredit the rule of law and democratic development in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I see these contradictions in other areas too. Macedonia has been mentioned. For many months, we have courted the KLA, without any decommissioning of arms taking place. KFOR therefore shares the blame for developments in Macedonia and the outbreaks of fresh conflict. In Kosovo, we pursued a policy which was designed to prevent ethnic cleansing; today, we witness other completely unacceptable instances of ethnic cleansing in the wake of the NATO campaign. In my view, this is incompatible with a preventive and sustainable security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the time has come to move away from a policy which contains the conflicts and limits the damage to which it has itself contributed. It is time to expect and demand democracy, the rule of law and the protection of minority and human rights not only from our political opponents but also to practise them even when they stand in the way of our own power-political interests. I think that the positive developments in Yugoslavia have genuinely achieved a great deal, but changes in NATO and EU policy are long overdue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During our recent visit to Yugoslavia, delegates from the Serbian parliament informed us that material damage alone ran into over USD 100 billion, not counting the livestock lost and the damage to the natural environment, not just in Yugoslavia but in the Balkans as a whole, as a result of the tens of thousands of depleted uranium bombs dropped there.</p>
<p class="contents">Then along comes the Council with a proposal to give Yugoslavia macro-financial assistance to the ridiculous tune of a few hundred million – no doubt the thirty pieces of silver for the subordinates in Belgrade who, in the most disgraceful manner and despite a decision to the contrary by the country’s parliament and supreme constitutional court, handed the former president of Yugoslavia, who was democratically elected in four elections, to a court set up on the orders of the USA and ΝΑΤΟ in order to try anyone who resists the new order.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic crime which Milosevic committed was to refuse to kow-tow to ΝΑΤΟ. The real criminals, such as Tutzman, Izetbegovic etc., who did kow-tow, were acquitted. But history will have the last word. I am certain that it will judge today’s decision to be one of the ugliest moments in the life of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also makes it necessary for us, and this should be a matter of priority, to come face to face with the reality of our failure and to ask ourselves what is the cause of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The cause is simple. The European Union was only pretending to follow the logic of peace. In reality, it was merely using humanitarian speeches to cover up the real logic, the logic of war, a war which was in the interests of several powers and which was intended to destroy Yugoslavia, which is what happened in just a few years. We can only understand this if we think along geopolitical lines. Although this is the only means of understanding the reality of power relationships between nations, in other words diplomacy itself, we are still obstinately refusing to carry out a geopolitical analysis. Yet this would reveal the truth, a truth which is glaringly obvious, in other words that there are three powers pursuing converging interests in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">First there is Germany, which has never got over the fact that, after both the First World War and the Second, it was to some extent against its interests, or at least against the interests of its European expansionism, that the country of Yugoslavia was created as a single entity. As soon as Germany was reunified in 1990, it played an important part in breaking the stranglehold of Serbia, its old enemy, so as to be reunited with its Slovenian and Croatian allies, and let us not forget, with two precious Mediterranean coastlines. In the same way, Turkey easily regained the connivance of Albania, and its military arm, the KLA.</p>
<p class="contents">To some extent urged on by the whole of the Muslim world, Turkey has reconquered some very old, very ancient positions in Balkan Europe, and it has obviously done so against the interests of Europe, but in the interests of the United States which, like any empire, knows very well how to divide and rule, and has profited and continues to profit from stirring up very old conflicts and fanning the flames of very old quarrels in what we can only call Greater Turkey, which is in the process of installing itself in the Balkans, to the great detriment, of course, of Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it in a nutshell, Europe has worked against itself, and in my view this is a further sign of its failure to conduct a rational diplomacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Thank you very much. I appreciate the passions stirred up by the issue of the Balkans, specifically Yugoslavia. However, my objective here today is rather more modest.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we must react to the events of recent weeks as a European Community, offering a significant message of support to the Yugoslavian authorities and supporting the stabilisation and economic reform efforts made by that country. I especially welcome the efforts made by this House, and in particular Mr Brok. The acceleration of the process has been complex in recent weeks and this makes it difficult for the different committees to express their points of view on the proposal we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, our objective is limited. It is important, but it is limited, given the difficult economic and financial situation of Yugoslavia, which requires the international community to offer significant financial support. The Yugoslavian authorities have implemented important economic reform programmes, which have been welcomed and accepted by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">You have referred to the fundamental issue of the Conference of Donors. This Conference has shown support for the economic transition and recovery programme, produced in collaboration with the World Bank and also with the European Commission. The good news has been – and Mr Lange has referred to it – the existence of sufficient funds to finance everything that was intended. It has even been possible to exceed the USD 1 250 million which was envisaged as aid for Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">What contribution is the European Community making at the moment? We are cooperating via two channels. The first channel is EUR 230 million, in 2001, which is the Community aid for reconstruction, democracy and stabilisation in the area, the so-called ‘CARDS’ aid. However, as well as this, we have proposed 300 million in macro-financial assistance with a very specific aim, that is the reduction of the balance of payments deficit. Of course, we intend to extend the mandate which allows Yugoslavia to receive EIB loans.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the Commission made its proposal, referred to by Mr Brok, of 23 May, trying to react, as he said, quickly and to persuade the Council of Ministers to accept. As he has also said, there has been a certain change in the Council of Ministers, lending more weight to loans and less to donations, a change which we in the Commission do not agree with. I would like to expressly thank Mr Brok for his support for the Commission’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are talking about a proposal for macro-financial assistance. And every time we have given this sort of aid, we have done so with certain conditions within the European Union and I do not believe that there is any argument for changing that model. We are talking about aid which is complementary to aid implemented by other international institutions and bilateral donors, aid which is intended to prevent the external financial restrictions suffered by that country. That means that we are working in conjunction with the Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We are referring to 2001, although it may be considered for future years, but, at the moment, we are talking about the restrictions for 2001 and next year. This type of aid, as you know, is conditional upon certain economic policy demands and is proposed within a stand-by programme of the International Monetary Fund for one year.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, our proposal was 120 million in donation and 180 in loan, the latter for 15 years under conditions similar to those for other countries. The basic agreement in the Council has reduced the donation to 75 million, leaving the rest for loans. We consider that, given Yugoslavia’s high level of debt and its other difficulties, and coherence with other types of similar modernisations which we have carried out in the past, the Commission’s proposal is coherent with our practice. We will therefore continue to insist in the Council that the conditions we have proposed be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok’s report proposes a series of amendments; I will later provide you with a note which explains our exact position. Our view of the amendments is as follows, to put it very briefly: first, it is not necessary to include the references to CARDS in this particular case, since we are talking about another type of aid, and not about CARDS aid, which is of a different nature. Certain amendments do not therefore seem acceptable, such as Amendments Nos 1, 11, 15 and 19.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the political conditions. Macro-financial assistance is not the correct instrument for imposing political conditions. We can therefore accept Amendment No 2 if its wording can be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no problem with the references to the assistance which the Union is already carrying out, the approval of the Fund programmes, the reform of external aid, the margins of the Guarantee Fund and the multiannual financial aid package for Yugoslavia; Amendments Nos 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 are therefore acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have greater difficulty with the problem of the references to the distribution of the burden. We have no problem with Amendment No 5, but to make payment conditional upon what other donors do is neither a condition nor a system which is normally introduced in the case of macro-financial assistance. Amendment No 13, in its current specific form, would not be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">One point which you have raised is the reference to its exceptional assistance character. Of course it is exceptional assistance. Of course it is of a temporary nature. And this is already reflected in the text. Therefore, certain references do not seem necessary to us, such as its not exceeding 2003. I do not know if it will be necessary for us to reconsider the issue in 2003, but to say now that in no event are we going to do anything in 2003 does not seem correct to us. Neither does it seem necessary for Amendment No 7 to refer doubly to the concessional and temporary issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the obligatory consultations with, shall we say, bodies of a political nature, we believe that the political debate is taking place now and will take place in the Council. But once the conditions have been basically defined, the Economic and Financial Committee must be the correct body to carry out the control of what in reality we are going to talk about, that is to say, the practical application of the proposals. We therefore believe that other types of conditions are not reasonable, such as those established in Amendments Nos 12, 14 and the first part of Amendment No 16.</p>
<p class="contents">You request additional reports to Parliament. We are thinking of the reports proposed in Amendments Nos 16, 18 and 19. We can accept the one in Amendment No 19, if it refers to information on the previous year. It is very difficult to give information on the same year unless it is excessively delayed information, but the production of additional general reports, as well as the one we present every year, on macro-financial assistance, we believe to be an unnecessary bureaucratic burden. Nevertheless, we do understand that Parliament wishes to control and know what is happening with these issues. We are therefore at your disposal to provide you with information on the implementation of this aid, whenever Parliament may ask for it. But we believe that it is much better to react to specific proposals than to establish this type of formal obligation, which does not always have the necessary interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I would lastly like to comment on certain precise dates which are laid down in relation to the limits for the first and second payments. You say that the first payment must be made before 31 December and the second before 30 June. There are two problems. One problem is bureaucratic, administrative: will we make it by 31 December? This is not the real difficulty. The real difficulty is that in the system of macro-financial assistance we are working with certain economic policy conditions and these payments can only be made in the event that these conditions are met. Of course, our objective is the same as yours: to implement aid as soon as possible, to pay it as quickly as possible and in this respect we are going to continue working with Parliament in complete harmony.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I will end here, I would like to thank Parliament for its support for the Commission proposal on the granting of macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I hope that at the next Council we can adopt a response which will allow us to quickly confront, as Mr Brok said, this important challenge and be coherent with our own past positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
