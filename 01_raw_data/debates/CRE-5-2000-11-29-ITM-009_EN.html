<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy-Quint (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the Commission in March 1999 highlighted the need to reform its structures and working methods. The energetic reform exercise it is now undertaking must seek above all to restore public confidence. The need for reform is beyond doubt and the Commission must become a first-class administration in the service of our political objective. That is an essential condition for lending credibility to the construction of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the reports by the independent experts, the Commission, at the initiative of Mr Kinnock, presented a White Paper proposing reforms to the way it functions. Officially, our Parliament is consulted simply with a view to delivering an opinion, but Mr Kinnock assured us that our views would be taken very seriously in the Commission's further activities, in which we will be associated. Given the scale of the task, four committees were involved and a hitherto unknown procedure was applied, in the form of four parallel reports. Let me now welcome the work done with my PPE colleagues, Mr Pomés Ruiz, Mr Harbour and Mr Lamassoure.</p>
<p class="contents">So we decided on a method of looking at the entire issue, without any overlaps. That method was respected and involved us in a major consultation process. It enabled us to take a common approach, which respected each committee's terms of reference while seeking a real, underlying consistency among our reports. However, I want to point out that the PSE considers it essential for the reform to respect the treaties in a very pragmatic way.</p>
<p class="contents">The cohesion between all the reform sectors should assure the people of Europe that the methods by which European integration is managed politically are clearly visible and truly transparent. Obviously the modernisation of a structure as complex as the Commission requires diplomacy, patience and trust on the part of the various players, and particularly the staff. That is why we want to ensure that this process is not imposed from above; we consider it crucial that all the staff are effectively associated in this whole process of modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it may be led from the top, the reform must be clear and visible to the unions, to all the staff, who must be effectively associated in this whole process. We are firmly resolved to give a new dynamism to the European civil service, but that means we must respect certain principles: the European civil service must continue to be governed by a single set of interinstitutional Staff Regulations, which ensure that every official is recruited at the same basic grade and provide for real mobility, access to real training. The recruitment procedure must always guarantee equal opportunities to all EU nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budget's opinion on the reform concentrates on these major aspects, in line with our powers and responsibilities. The leitmotif is the systematic reminder that, parallel to any legislative procedure, all budgetary decisions must be taken in the framework of the related annual procedures and the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has a great responsibility towards the citizens. As an arm of the budgetary authority, it must ensure that public monies are properly used. Moreover, over and above all other considerations, we will be even more careful in future to ensure that the Commission really does spend the adopted budget on implementing the various political priorities our Parliament has democratically decided, rather than reallocating it on the basis of functional weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The package of measures proposed in the White Paper must help modernise the whole way the Commission functions and make it more efficient. We will support it and ensure that these procedures lead, as soon as possible, to a management culture geared to results and performance criteria, taking account of the cost-benefit ratio but also of our political priorities, and remembering that decentralisation and delegation of authority are essential tools, provided that power of decision and of supervision are guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication from the European Commission must deliver a common message to the various institutions. In concrete terms, it is crucial to review the procedures for honouring the budget votes. The non-execution of the budget, the excessive delay between inclusion in the budget and commitment, and then the payment of appropriations, is a caricature. It is extremely urgent to find ad hoc procedures to restore credibility to the Commission's activities. That means we must review the procedures and fix realistic objectives so that the backlog can be cleared rapidly and the delay between commitments and payments, which undermines the credibility of a large part of the budget, can be reduced. We must also provide for the suspension of contracts if there is no longer any consistency between budget appropriations and political commitments, and for paying subsidies and commitments at an early date. The credibility of the Commission, and therefore of the European Union, depends on its ability to reform its financial management systems very quickly. In the medium term, it is essential to fine-tune the budgetary procedures and ensure closer consultation between the budgetary authority and the Commission at the beginning of each financial year. That will avoid our plunging into the great difficulties we experienced in November and December and into situations that do not enable Parliament's political expectations to be translated correctly or allow for the real modernisation of the functioning of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">An annual evaluation of the changes in the functioning of the Commission and of the additional cost of this reform requires consultation at the beginning of each financial year. That measure will take time, but it is inevitable and crucial to the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of global management by project must be accompanied by a new nomenclature to ensure transparent management. We are very much in favour of that. We will make sure that all the technical provisions can be implemented on the basis of full respect for Parliament's rights as an arm of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee was very pleased to see the conclusions of the Bourlanges report on externalisation taken up in the Letter of Amendment. However, in regard to commitology, the Member States all too often promote national interests that are at odds with those of the Community and consultation of their committees slows down the decision-making process and increases the cost. So the reform must provide an opportunity to restrict their intervention solely to areas where no expenditure is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not dwell on the question of human resources since Mr Harbour has addressed it. The Commission's human resources are obviously not up to the new tasks entrusted to it, in addition to those it will have to assume in the future, and the redeployment proposed in the Letter of Amendment, which only relates to 4% of staff, will not resolve the human resources problem either.</p>
<p class="contents">In accepting the substance of the Letter of Amendment during the budgetary consultation procedure last Thursday, the Council proved that the other arm of the budgetary authority did in fact wish to support the reform of our Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions of audit, management and financial control are basically dealt with in Mr Pomés Ruiz's report. The Commission's position on the recasting of the Financial Regulation has been known since 22 November. We expressed our views on the reform of the fast-track procedure in the vote on the van Hulten report. Yet we would point out again that it is absolutely vital to guarantee independent financial control. Moreover, it is totally illogical for the Council alone to be able to amend the Financial Regulation and we repeat our call for conciliation on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the Commission is crucial to the future of our institutions. The working method chosen by the Conference of Presidents, which some found rather risky, took time. But looking at the four reports as a whole, this period of consultation has allowed us to take both a broader and a closer view, which has increased the value of Parliament's opinion. This report looks at the very first steps in the reform of the Commission, a major project aimed at the genuinely modern management of the Union. It will be followed by many other reports and, for my part, after these weeks of working together, I hope we adhere to this method in future too.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to give particular thanks to the other three rapporteurs, for I really appreciated the way we worked and the clarity of their positions. The differences of view that emerged are not just political but more a reflection of the cultural differences between the Fifteen. They show that the very different approaches to the management of the public service we see every day in the different EU institutions, as also in our political groups. The implementation of this reform clearly reflects the difficulties we are facing, but we know that this exercise, however difficult, is a vital one.</p>
<p class="contents">Together, we have contributed to this first stage that is crucial for the political future of the Union; we have modernised its management to make it more transparent and therefore bring it closer to our citizens, so as to convince them more firmly that their only future lies in a stronger European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This examination is intended, above all, to give new life, new support, to the Commission after the crisis it has suffered, which we all regret.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to warmly thank Mrs Guy-Quint, Mr Harbour and Mr Lamassoure for their work. We four rapporteurs have worked in a great spirit of cooperation and that means that this procedure, which is complicated in itself, will tomorrow give rise to four coordinated reports, which do not overlap each other and which provide the encouragement which we all wish to see for the task and responsibility which President Prodi has taken on.</p>
<p class="contents">While each report deals with the aspects which concern each committee, there is a common element amongst the four: they all express a generally favourable opinion of the proposals for reform presented by the Commission in its White Paper, although at the same time they remain vigilant with regard to their implementation and development.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am pleased to inform you that my report has been approved unanimously, apart from one abstention, and that we have been unanimous in stressing once again the need for a strong, independent, transparent and efficient Commission; in short, a genuine pillar for European integration. We have also been unanimous in stating that many of the shortcomings and irregularities that were condemned during the discharge for 1996 were due to the fact that previous Commissions had not managed to modernise their management and control systems and had not applied all of the legislation in force.</p>
<p class="contents">In drawing up my report, I have been able to study not only the White Paper, but also the second report of the committee of independent experts and the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 19 January, proposed by Michiel van Hulten, on the work of the aforementioned committee of experts. The Committee on Budgetary Control and I myself are pleased to see that, in producing the White Paper, the Commission has largely taken its inspiration from the proposals of the independent experts and has taken account of many of the observations made by Parliament on 19 January.</p>
<p class="contents">As the committee with responsibility for budgetary control, I highlight in the report approved by the committee the aspects of the reform concerning competence in this area. In this respect, we have fully supported the establishment of a true sense of responsibility amongst officials. This is the basis of the new philosophy for management of the Commission: each administrative unit will be expected to take responsibility for the regularity and legality of all its actions. The Directors-General will have responsibility for the internal control of their directorates-general, without in any way exempting the respective Commissioners from their own political responsibility with regard to the functioning of the services and that includes, where appropriate, the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The main task of the new internal auditing service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President with responsibility for reform, will be to analyse the functions and systems of internal control which exist within the Commission. This function is, as the Court of Auditors points out in its report 4/97, much broader and more general than the current function performed by <span class="italic">ex ante</span> overall control.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to remind you that on 5 October last our Parliament gave the green light to the amendment of Article 24(5) of the financial regulation currently in force. In that way Parliament put an end to what the Court of Auditors had been condemning since 1981 and which it reiterated in its report 4/97: a latent conflict which exists between the power to grant an approval – and hence to authorise an item of expenditure – and the task of assessing it soon after according to criteria of good financial management. This amendment makes sense in a transitional period until the adoption of the new financial regulation which, according to the recommendations of the committee of experts, is intended to establish a system of control, based not on <span class="italic">ex ante</span> centralized control, but on <span class="italic">ex post, a posteriori</span>, auditing.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the new system will prove to be more effective than the current one. The Court of Auditors, in its report 4/97, repeats its position with regard to the impact of financial control, which is not evenly balanced. Compared to the great efficiency that it demonstrates with regard to appropriations managed directly by the Commission, its weakness with regard to decentralised operational costs is notable. Evidence of this weakness can be found in the extremely limited number of refusals of approval, of authorisation, originating from the Commission. The Court of Auditors indicates in its report that it is not opposed to the removal of prior approval provided that it is replaced by other procedures, which offer guarantees that are at least equivalent, and can thereby involve parties other than the financial controller.</p>
<p class="contents">This other party is specifically the internal auditing service, which will be completely independent. The Court of Auditors also says that, on the express condition that the role of the contractor...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President indicated that the speaker’s allotted time had elapsed)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that this is not a time for complacency, Mr President. We are not here to celebrate a victory. The fact that this Parliament is supporting the reform of the Commission should encourage it to shoulder its risks, its responsibility, as Mr Kinnock has promised, and also to get it right. They have the duty to get it right and to take risks, not to avoid them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recall that I first met Vice-President Kinnock in December last year when the parliament intimated that I was to be asked to take on this task. So it has taken eleven months before we have moved forward. It has been a very pleasurable experience. Certainly I echo what colleagues have said that the team of rapporteurs have worked very well together. It has been a pleasure to work together and I think the process of addressing a crucial reform of the Commission that is central to the future of the European Union has had added depth and richness because the four of us have been involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of my report is on the strategy for the human resource reforms. I emphasis strategy because the Legal Affairs Committee has perhaps at least two years work ahead of it, although we hope not quite as long as that, in scrutinising all the reforms of the Staff Regulations that will flow from the human resource reforms. So we were keen to make sure that the strategic framework was in place and that it was the right one. Generally we are satisfied with that, but we are not complacent about it and I just want to highlight what I think are some of the crucial issues that the Commission is facing and how we can help them achieve this absolutely critical reform. One of the things that we were keen to do in our committee was not just to look at this in isolation but to look at what was going on outside. We held a very successful public hearing on the reforms where we brought in people from private and public industry to give us the environment, the organisational and human resource changes that are going on around us, in which the Commission is going to have to move forward with these reforms. Indeed it is going to have to recruit the best people in a very competitive market.</p>
<p class="contents">What was very interesting from those discussions was to see how employment and organisation practices in private and public sector are actually moving closer together. Big organisations everywhere now are becoming more open; they are becoming more transparent; they are using information technology in new ways; they are moving away from traditional vertical forms of organisation, sharing information across organisations and between each other. That is the crucial lesson that the Commission is going to have to take up in the details of its reform.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short time this evening I do not have time to go through all our specific recommendations in detail, so I want to centre on what I think is the key element of how these reforms must move forward. We must develop an organisation within the Commission that is going to centre around giving every official clear objectives, giving them the right resources to deliver those objectives. That includes the all important financial resources, as both Ms Guy-Quint and Mr Pomés Ruiz have emphasised, and <span class="italic">empowering</span> them to use those resources accordingly. They must be given goals to be measured against, but also rewarded in terms of salary and promotion depending on how well they meet those goals.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the core of what we are trying to do here. Those people who progress through the organisation will do so in a structured way with better career planning. They may expect to move to other European institutions, to be seconded to national governments, or to work in the private sector. That should become the norm, part of a standard career in the European Commission. They would also expect during that career to meet with people who are coming in from outside: on a short-term contract; a specialist, a young person who sees three or four or five years working in the Commission as part of a career plan. We should be encouraging those people alongside the structured career plan of the permanent service in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect all this in a modern organisation in future. The strategy is right but the details have to be right as well to really succeed. In managing an organisation it is all very well having the rules and regulations in place but there are so many other crucial ingredients: the attitude of the staff, their commitment and support for the plans and their willingness to change. All of those will be crucial and the involvement of everybody, whether in trade unions or not, will also be absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Leadership from the top will be crucial. Vice-President Kinnock has tremendous enthusiasm for everything he does. He has led this process very enthusiastically, but it has to be led from the very top. I was pleased that all four of us had the opportunity to meet President Prodi recently. He assured us that he also gave these reforms his full backing. From the top all of these reforms must cascade down as quickly as possible to give the European Union the powerful Commission that it really needs to deliver its objectives over the next 20 years.</p>

It does, however, constitute the first stage of a wider discussion launched by Commission President Prodi himself, concerning what is called the governance of the Union. A further document on the subject is being prepared by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in that spirit, in order to start the debate immediately, that our Committee on Constitutional Affairs, following the other three committees consulted, looked at the question of the Commission's political effectiveness. Is the Commission able today to carry out the tasks and, in addition, the political role which fall to it under the Treaties?</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, in a Europe which will have 30 Member States tomorrow, with a bloated Council and a 700-member, 20-language Parliament, the Commission will have a more important role than ever to play in defining and upholding the common European interest. Accordingly, our committee repeats its attachment to a strong, independent, effective, transparent and politically answerable Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To guarantee that it has these qualities, we insist on five points. One: the spirit of good governance must not be confined to the Commission's management tasks. It must also underpin its function of proposing legislation, for instance by devising an internal procedure which will ensure that the subsidiarity principle is respected and by keeping a chronological record of procedures in order to reduce excessive delays in the preparation of documents. Second important point: the Commission is the only institution that can coordinate all the activities relating to the preparation and follow-up of European decisions. Where it does not do so, the results are felt, as we have seen, especially in the second and third pillars. So we call on the Member States to give the Commission the main role in the preparation for and follow-up to meetings of the European Council and of the Council of Ministers in all its forms, which can be done without formally modifying the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is not up to the Commission itself to manage the implementation of the European policies or of the corresponding appropriations. The White Paper points out that at present about half the Commission staff is assigned to management tasks. That is too few if we consider that the Commission should manage itself. It is far too many if we think it should offload most of these management tasks, which is our view. Decentralisation must be the rule, in favour of the national administrations or external agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding these agencies, the three institutions should take the deliberations on governance as an opportunity to establish a common doctrine on what is called externalisation. The establishment of independent agencies is justified whenever a scientific or technical opinion is required or decentralised management seems better. That was the case, for example, with the European Drugs Monitoring Centre. It will be the case tomorrow for food security or air safety, but provided we avoid any dismembering of the Commission's political responsibility and ensure that the latter has the legal means to account to Parliament and the Council for the way in which the agencies perform their tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is also time to look at the Union's external representation. We discussed that during this afternoon's debate on the common foreign policy. Here too we have reached the borderline between what aspects come under good governance and what may justify measures of institutional reform, questions that were raised by Commissioner Patten. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls for an overall study into the problem of the Union's external representation both in dealing with third countries in international negotiations and in international bodies, and to consider the establishment of a common diplomatic service. The debate on governance is thus launched. We will continue it in spring on the basis of the Nice conclusions and the new Commission proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Committee on Budgets we consider that the establishment of the budget by activities causes us problems because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority. We have just come from a budgetary negotiation with the Council, as Mrs Guy-Quint is well aware, where the hardest thing has been to determine in a clearer and more precise way what the limits of budgetary power are for one party or another.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets considers that Parliament must not lose its control over the allocation of administrative appropriations. Our fears are not greatly allayed by the fact that, when the establishment of the budget by activities is over, category 5 of the financial perspectives will disappear. We are not speaking against these consequences, but in favour of safeguarding the budgetary powers of this Parliament. Therefore, any tendency of the Commission reform to covertly remove from Parliament this ability to control administrative expenditure would create interinstitutional problems in the short term. However, an approach that safeguards Parliament’s powers of control and decision-making with regard to expenditure in the current category 5 will guarantee that the Commission reform will be negotiated with no further problems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the TAOs and the transitional period for their dismantling, my Group insists that the Commission should make the greatest possible effort to limit that transitional period. We therefore ask the Commissioner: can the Commission guarantee a truly limited transitional period?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must deal with the thorny issue of the proposal on early retirement. We are awaiting a three-way dialogue to define this question, amongst others, before the final approval of the 2001 budget. My group does not reject the idea of this proposal on early retirement being obligatory. We believe that the lack of definition of the current proposal could create more problems than advantages and we have already received some indications of concern from various officials. Nevertheless, we will give the Commission our vote of confidence so that it can give as much detail as possible about the scope of its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">During the coming three-way dialogue, we hope to receive good news on many issues, including this one, as well as the lifting of the reserve in the category of new posts. This would clearly indicate this Parliament’s goodwill in relation to moving ahead with this reform with the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, that is how I was going to begin but looking around the room I am beginning to doubt my own words. It is indicative of the way Parliament works that we are still not used to putting the items where we really have a big input at the top of our agenda and instead first debate those issues where Parliament does not have a formal say.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from Mr Kinnock)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Six months after the Commission set out its plans in a White Paper, Parliament is ready to give its opinion. I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs. They did an excellent job under difficult conditions. Admittedly, we created the difficult conditions ourselves, but they were difficult conditions nonetheless. On matters as important as this one it is important that Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that is what tomorrow’s vote will demonstrate we are doing. I would like to extend my particular thanks to Mr Pomés Ruiz who drew up the report for the Committee on Budgetary Control. He demonstrated great willingness to take on board the views of his fellow members of the committee. The result of this exercise is a strong set of reports which will receive the near-unanimous endorsement of the House tomorrow. So I think the Commission had better take them seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an important day for Commission reform because the Commission today adopted a number of proposals which I believe will be the key to restoring the confidence of the people of Europe in our institutions. First, the Commission has accepted the need for rules to protect whistle-blowers. The crisis which led to the Commission’s resignation last year demonstrated the absence of adequate provisions for dealing with genuine, honest complaints put forward by hard-working officials. While we may continue to differ over the role played by Mr Van Buitenen it is clear that he should never have been punished for following his conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the Commission proposes to overhaul the disciplinary procedure. This is long overdue. The Commission has now decided to accept the recommendations by the Committee of Independent Experts that the disciplinary board should be headed by an independent chair. This will greatly enhance, and will be seen to enhance, the fairness and accuracy of the disciplinary process.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the Commission has adopted a proposal for an advisory group on standards in public life to be set up by inter-institutional agreement. This is also in line with the proposals made by the independent experts, and one which was strongly endorsed by Parliament in its resolution of 19 January of this year. The report by Mr Pomés Ruiz sets out Parliament’s position on this issue in greater detail. I am happy to see that the Commission’s proposal appears to be consistent with the position we are due to adopt tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">But important challenges still lie ahead. The overhaul of the system of financial management and control has only just begun and while I do not share the pessimistic view just expressed by my EPP colleague I do think there is a lot of work left to be done. The de-centralisation of financial control to DGs is an important step but it will only work if staff are properly trained, if sufficient resources are available, and if the responsibility of line managers is properly enforced. In this context two aspects of the process are of particular concern to us. First, the Commission has not yet taken up our suggestion to set up an external chamber for financial discipline. The Commission may have perfectly good reasons for not doing so, but we would like to know what they are. Second, the setting up of a financial irregularities help-desk or panel as proposed in the White Paper is acceptable to my group only if it can be shown that such a help-desk will in no way undermine the ability of OLAF to do its work.</p>
<p class="contents">After one and a half years of discussion and preparation the Commission is now putting its money where its mouth is. The reform process is on track and being implemented as the Commission’s progress reports have shown. The only danger in my view right now is that we become complacent and that we give in to the forces of conservatism. They are everywhere: in Parliament, in the Council, in the Commission. I therefore call on the Commission to redouble its efforts and to make sure that in two years’ time, we have the first results that will show the people of Europe that the Commission is working again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improving EU administration is one of most important reforms of this parliamentary term. The main objective of the reform of the Commission must be a reduction in bureaucracy, increased efficiency and an end to financial confusion. This means simplifying ways of working, devolving power downwards, and a better definition of the power of decision. The key to reform is to increase and emphasise the importance of personal responsibility. People in positions of responsibility within the institutions must bear both the legal and financial responsibility for their decisions. Emphasising the importance of personal responsibility requires, among other things, the swift reform of Staff Regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform will require activity-based budgeting. The managers of units and institutions must be given a certain amount of leeway in administration. Attention should be mainly focused on results, rather than working practice. Only then can the resources that are available be allocated most effectively. An institution and its directors must have clear scope for the best possible administrative practices. Bearing responsibility will mean ending the advance monitoring of financing. If there is more than one decision-maker, nobody clearly bears the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Administrative reform is particularly necessary to improve financial transactions in the European Union. The same practice needs to be followed in the payment of EU bills as in the outside world. The current three-month term is too long, let alone the fact that many payments are delayed for more than a year. That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice. My group firmly supports administrative reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time and again in today's debate on Nice, we heard that the EU is facing enormous challenges and that the enlargement of the EU to an eventual total of 27 or more Member States will test the resilience of the European institutions. At the same time, however, the prestige of the European institutions has sunk to a new low in the eyes of the public, beset as they are between a lack of confidence on the one hand and the pressure generated by a growing number of problems on the other; by way of example, I need only name three of the most pressing problems at the present time – the oil crisis, climate change and BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need reform of the institutions, the sort of reform that will rebuild confidence and enable the Union to act more effectively. We need legitimacy, which is born of greater efficiency, activity-based management, the creation of a culture of accountability, greater transparency, user-friendly administrative services and decentralisation. We can only endorse these aims that the Commission has set itself. We do fear, however, that the required degree of courage is still lacking in certain areas. Let me take the example of transparency. The Commission made great promises about transparency when it took office. Sadly, the reality of the situation is quite different, as is shown by the framework agreement with Parliament and the rules on access to information. We can see that some ground still needs to be made up here, and we hope that the Commission will take a bolder approach to the transparency problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As for disciplinary procedures, pledges have been made here too, but no clear rules have been formulated so far, nor have we seen or heard any clear statements as to how such rules would be enforced, nor has the question of external agencies been conclusively resolved. We are hoping for an unequivocal statement on this at an early date. With regard to 'whistle-blowers', I should like to subscribe to Mr van Hulten's earlier remarks. On this matter too, we should have welcomed a less diffident approach from the Commission and greater courage on its part to address this problem openly, because whistle-blowers, of course, contributed in no small measure to the fact that reform process was finally set in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the budget is another area in which the Commission – and Parliament too, for that matter – must consider in future what to do about the problem of backlogs, how to ensure that we start to address the question of budgetary commitments in the implementation of new programmes too, so that we do not always have this huge discrepancy between commitments and payments. In the domain of personnel too, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – of all groups – had imagined that Parliament might have been more accommodating towards the Commission. Indeed, we believe that the establishment of new posts has been very tentative; given the current tasks of the Commission and the forthcoming eastward enlargement, there will certainly be a need to increase the rate of staff recruitment in future.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as I have said, there has been a regrettable lack of support from Parliament. The European Parliament needs to take a good look at itself here too. In general, we consider the basic approach taken in the White Paper to be right and proper, and we hope that the Commission has staying power and further reserves of courage on which it can draw in the course of the implementation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We take note of the fact that the Commission has endeavoured to introduce progressively a new budgetary nomenclature, but we would like to know when this process will be completed. I would just like to point out that, according to the experts, under the current budgetary nomenclature most of the subsidies are in fact disguised contracts, which the Commission refuses to treat as such because transparency is ensured even less effectively by subsidies than by contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not dwell on the recruitment procedures. The fact remains that the secrecy veiling these procedures is still incomprehensible. As far as we are concerned, the only reform possible was put forward by the Socialist Group when it tabled 3 amendments to the Bösch report, which we discussed during the last part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close by touching on the commitology. According to the Committee of Independent Experts, the committees of the representatives of the Member States tend in practice to become a mechanism through which national interests are represented in the implementation of Community policies, sometimes to the point where they become a forum for dividing up the booty of Community funds. In our opinion, on this issue, the Commission sees nothing, hears nothing and sometimes speaks in a whisper if at all. With regard to the Commission reform, we feel that the disparity between declared goals and accomplished facts is clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This process of transformation is necessary to be able to truly serve God and cannot be enforced by rules. Although the reform of the Commission is not to be compared with Paul’s message, this Biblical precept contains an important lesson for the Commission: rules cannot enforce true obedience.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Kinnock is trying, by changing and improving the rules, to give the Commission officials an enhanced sense of responsibility. As sound as the intention behind the rules may be, ultimately it all revolves around the implementation of these rules. The new rules must therefore be tested as to their feasibility. At the deepest level, this reform process is about a change of attitude and behaviour on the part of the Commission and its officials.</p>
<p class="contents">This change of attitude should find expression in openness of government. The reform plans still leave a lot to be desired on that score. The proposed advisory service for financial irregularities will not only undermine OLAF’s openness, but also its work.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of its limited budget, the Commission will have to make choices in its task package. We must choose between deepening or enlarging the Union. The years to come will be dominated by the issue of enlargement. It is therefore astounding that the rapporteurs Mrs Guy-Quint and Mr Pomés Ruiz completely pass over this and merely regard the reform process as a means of achieving European political integration. I believe that the reform of the Commission should be seen in the context of enlargement, and that is what it must be guided by. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As in the case of anything new which changes established situations, care and precision are clearly necessary. Those with legislative responsibility cannot, and must not, let themselves be influenced by emotion and must not accept proposals <span class="italic">in toto</span> which, although the product of brilliant minds, do not follow the principle of representativeness. The experts, as such, are specialists, but the legislator cannot be either their obedient servant or another expert: he must hear, consult, reflect and then produce on his own initiative, or else he may as well give up politics and leave law-making to the experts.</p>
<p class="contents">We would point out that part of the reform, which was unwisely adopted in September last year in line with the experts' proposal, was then rejected by the Court of Justice. The entire structure of the Commission, which is a fundamental institutional body of the Union's current system, implements<span class="bold"> </span>European Union policy as willed by Parliament and the Council. Parliament must succeed in reforming the appropriate and necessary parts of the Commission without undue influence from outside, in order indeed to guarantee efficiency and transparency but also to make those who work there more aware of themselves, of what they are, of what they do and for whom they work.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there is no structure of greater importance or substance in the world: 15 nations, soon to become 20 or more, an entire continent; the most industrialised part of the globe thrives in the Union and, therefore, in the Commission through its structures. The officials working in the Commission and Parliament must be top quality, aware of this and paid accordingly. They must work but they must also receive all the guarantees and prerogatives appropriate to their job. They must be accountable but not subjected to humiliation. If we give due recognition to those who have to be good, hard workers in order to be here, we will achieve excellent institutions. Otherwise, everything will regress and the same problems may well arise as in the past, those very problems which have prompted us to carry out these reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like Mr Van Hulten I commend the way he worked with other people and was prepared to take on ideas and submissions from other political groups. At the same time I thank the Commission and its staff for their support and assistance. The Harbour report is really only the broad framework, it is basically the bones. There is still a lot to be done, and I believe that Parliament cannot rest on its laurels. We have already heard that the Commissioner earlier today launched a series of papers on individual aspects of the report. Parliament, I understand, will not officially be considering these. This is a mistake. For what happens in staff reform in the Commission will ultimately have repercussions for the Parliament and we should not forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pick up on the some 26 amendments which have been made to the Harbour report. As you would expect we are supporting Amendments Nos 1 to 6, submitted by the PSE. We shall however be withdrawing Amendment No 6 and asking for a split vote on the latter part of Amendment No 15 as we do not believe the current system within the ECB lends itself to this situation. We would ask that Amendments Nos 20 and 23 be taken as additions, as in Paragraph 10 it would be utter folly to delete the involvement in drawing up the job goals and the personnel development role of the appraisal system. Amendment No 23 looks like it was an afterthought and while we are not against it, it should not replace the existing Paragraph 22. We are supporting Amendments Nos 13, 14, 16 and 9 submitted by the PPE. We are opposing the rest of the amendments as they either add nothing to the report or basically take us off into flights of fantasy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something quickly about change. Change is never easy. Many people are resistant to change because of the fear of taking that step into the unknown. Can I say that as someone who has been an employee of an organisation which downsized without any consultation with the existing staff, I envy the Commission staff. Can I also say as someone who has been of another organisation who went through a downsizing and was made redundant, I am more than envious of the Commission staff and the way they are working and the Commissioner working with them. It is not easy being made redundant. I wish I had been offered the chance of retraining for another job within that organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recall what he said about the long gestation period of this work and I would encourage the Commission not to feel that the timetable is an indefinite one. There has been a vacuum and I would encourage the Commission to feel that its restored sense of self-confidence is important to us here in the Parliament and more importantly to the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I now draw attention to what Mr Lamassoure said in his explanatory statement about the institutional role of the Commission and particularly the political initiative. I do not often agree with my colleague Mr Van Dam who sits with me on the Estonian delegation. But he said two things I do accept, one that an attitudinal change was necessary and two, that enlargement is a key factor in the future success of the Commission. Mr Lamassoure says on enlargement that the Commission, as regards the accession process, is expected to propose a comprehensive strategy reflecting the Union's interest in its political timetable – not just an assessment regarding the suitability of each applicant country.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was previously in this Parliament, the President of the Commission was Jacques Delors and he worked alongside Commissioner Brittan and before him Commissioner Cockfield. They did not wait for ideas to be handed down from the Council of Ministers. They themselves devised the single market programme. They worked hand-in-hand with the Parliament throughout. They promoted the scheme and they achieved it. There was a sense of great self-confidence and harmony between the institutions. I would simply say to Commissioner Kinnock, and I am sure he needs no encouragement in this, that it is not just a question of management or technical detail, it is a question of personnel and belief in what you are doing and belief that the Parliament will work alongside the Commission. We must have a goal. That goal is enlargement and it is extremely difficult to achieve but we look to the Commission to be the driving force and we want to work alongside it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, our Group supports the Commission’s proposals – the White Paper – promoted by Commissioner Kinnock. Mr Harbour’s report views these proposals positively and we also support that report, which has been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while doing so, the Socialist Group considers that the current functioning of the Community’s public administration is reasonably efficient. We must remember that the crisis in the Commission was not caused by any failing in the Community’s administration but by political problems which had little to do with the functioning of the administration, and any desire to link the crisis in the Commission with the malfunctioning of its administration would be arbitrary.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that the Community administration is based on certain principles, which are well established in continental administration, such as the principle of a job for life and stable employment. These principles were established after a previous period in which public appointments resulted from the distribution of influences, from the system of cherry picking and string pulling. In light of this, the system of stable public administration offered a guarantee that political changes would not affect the functioning of the administration. In some countries, such as Spain, where our political life has been through tempestuous times, the administration, at least, has been a guarantee of stability. Therefore, while recognising that it is necessary to modernise the administration, our concern is to guarantee those fundamental principles of Community administration, which is currently occupied by extremely competent officials, who, often at great personal sacrifice, have to move home in order to set up in Brussels and who receive remuneration which is appropriate to the efforts that this entails.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel sure that the Commission will continue to present concrete proposals. We believe that we will have the opportunity to express our opinions on them and that throughout this time we will be able to help the Commission in developing the Community civil service. However, we feel that we ought to respect two fundamental principles; one, the recognition of situations that are recognised in law; the so-called acquired rights of officials and secondly, the principle of stability, of guarantee, and even the right to union membership, the right to the defence, by officials, of their post, their career and even their professional prestige. With this consideration, we urge the Commission and Mr Kinnock to move ahead with their efforts at reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret the fact that it took the resignation of the Commission in March 1999, due to dubious practices and maladministration, to initiate this reform. The European public’s confidence was shaken and it is much more difficult to regain this now. The Commission’s problems in implementing various programmes are clear to see. Delays in payment are mounting up and the bureaucratic obstacles are well known. The Commission’s new duties have multiplied, the complexity and the slowness of its procedures have grown worse and its structures, methods and formal constraints have not changed. We are all familiar with the consequences of this situation and it has tested the dedication and skill of the many people working in the Commission and in its administration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the Commission makes the best use of existing human resources and promotes new recruitment. This is not enough, however, to improve the implementation of actions and of available appropriations. We hope to see a thorough reorganisation of structures and working methods, and clarification of the distribution of powers between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is essential. The first two institutions are responsible for defining policies and priorities and making financial resources available. The Commission is responsible for ensuring that all the conditions are met in order to implement the financial management of Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this last aspect, the executive role of the Commission must be strengthened, above all, by a reform of commitology. Let us be clear on this matter: if, under the terms of Article 274 of the Treaty, the Commission alone is responsible for implementing the budget, then some interventions by Member States through management and regulatory committees, which have basically been put forward to express national interests, must be seen as hampering the Commission's ability to manage efficiently. This is what also needs to be changed in the procedure known as commitology. I am sure of the success of this reform and therefore congratulate the four rapporteurs, especially Mrs Guy­Quint, whose work I have followed most closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Kinnock’s White Paper offers a solution to these problems but also goes much further in that the reform proposals are founded on the basic principles of a modern European public service. The people of Europe should be the main concern of a service of this kind, and for their part, they simply expect to see results and appropriate action when their interests are at issue. Issues such as the BSE crisis, oil prices, and the greenhouse effect have a distinctly European dimension. So the Commission has an important task to fulfil in this respect. It will only be possible to achieve results for the citizens if the Commission is able to act swiftly and transparently, <span class="italic">and</span> be accountable to this public service, among other things. So this is what the goal of the reforms taking place within the Commission must be.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all seen how the culture of fear has rather paralysed – totally paralysed I might say – the decision-making processes within the Commission, and by that I also mean the departments and the officials. The field of external relations, for example, exemplifies the major problems that the Commission is unfortunately still struggling with. Many thousands of project applications have been awaiting assessment for over a year now. Letters and requests for information as to the state of play are either dealt with half-heartedly or not at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Situations of this kind have severely eroded the confidence of the citizens and organisations concerned. That being the case, Commissioner Kinnock’s proposed transition to efficiency and supervised management and budget deserves all the support it can get. The Commission could then concentrate on its core tasks and dramatically improve its efficiency. At the same time, the package of reform proposals could break through this culture of fear, restoring the officials’ faith in themselves as an organisation, because there are a lot of good people there.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament could then judge the Commission on its results, with the political priorities established by Parliament and the Council, but also, in fact, the emphasis on service provision for the people of the EU, forming the all-important framework for assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to quickly win back the credibility of the European public service in the eyes of the public. This cannot be achieved by over-emphasising the word ‘internal’ in the reforms. The public must also be able to feel that the Commission is truly accessible and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper on European governance that came out recently, contains a whole host of worthwhile initiatives to this end, but there is still a great deal to be done in other areas. I have in mind the people’s access to documents, an issue that we have yet to be satisfied on. Now is the time to close the chapter on fraud, bureaucracy and the fall of the Commission once and for all. Let us open a new book on a modern European public service that fulfils its constitutional role in the proper manner, is ready for the forthcoming enlargement and lastly, which embraces service provision for the European public as its new mission statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Kinnock and President Prodi will receive the full support of the socialist group, which also means that we will keep an ever-watchful eye on the results and criteria outlined so eloquently in the White Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The basic consensus with which they have worked is something to be greatly welcomed and is very encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate, as we have seen, is not so much about the principles, objectives and timeliness of the reform as about the procedures, pace, timetable, and possible shortcomings or unwanted consequences of its implementation. This is a necessary reform because at the root of it was a real political crisis, not just the normal self-criticism which occurs in the course of an administration that has been in action for several decades.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what we are dealing with here is not a political reform with administrative consequences but an administrative reform with political consequences. We are therefore dealing with one of those challenges that are occasionally faced by politicians who must find the best way to safeguard the governability of institutions, as well as the best way to provide the citizens with a good administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the reform will be a success for all of us and we all have a great deal at stake here. This being the case, it seems to me not only appropriate but also necessary to explore all the possibilities offered by interinstitutional dialogue. This dialogue must open up the basic legislative framework of Community finances to the codecision procedure. This dialogue must allow the establishment of common mechanisms in human resources policies. It must yield fruit in terms of multiannual budgetary agreements, within the framework of the Financial Perspectives and, finally, it must allow us to work jointly on the monitoring and control of the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European public is not so much interested in our plans, in the sense of the material design of the reform, as in the intentions, that is to say, its objectives and consequences. The public is going to judge us according to the degree of transparency, closeness in the decision-making responsibilities, coherence in the distribution of responsibilities, and according to the efficiency which is finally achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The difference between the time given to that debate and the time given to this debate and the occasion on which they took place, I would point out to Mr van Hulten, is very simple to understand. For the European Parliament, foreign affairs is a vital and interesting matter, and I completely agree that, having had a lifetime's interest myself in these issues, that is a proper explanation. For the European Parliament, reform is a vital matter on which it has decisive effect as a budgetary authority and as a legislature. That explains in politics why foreign affairs gets two hours and comes first and reform gets one hour and comes second. The more power you have over an issue, the later it comes in the night.</p>

It is also appropriate for me to provide an up-to-date picture of the latest progress with the implementation of our strategy for applying modernising changes and for preparing the further improvements, which we outlined in our strategy eight months ago. I am very pleased that my colleague, Michaele Schreyer has been able to join us and naturally she will respond on the parts of the reports that relate particularly to her budget portfolio.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by reporting to the House that this morning's meeting of the College as Mr Van Hulten said earlier, adopted a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory group on standards in public life, as outlined in Action 1 of the White Paper action programme. It adopted a preliminary strategy for decentralisation and simplification of decision-making procedures – something which eventually will lead to substantial increases in Commission productivity and reducing those strata of bureaucracy that everybody rightly talks about.</p>
<p class="contents">The College also agreed today substantial proposals relating to the reform of human resources policy. Those human resources policy documents relate to discipline, to whistle-blowing and to equal opportunities. They will be the formal basis for the legally required consultation between the Commission, its staff and staff representatives, which of course will take place over the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach on disciplinary procedure proposes several necessary changes, including the improvement and restructuring of the investigative phase of disciplinary proceedings, which would be handled by a specialist service. They include: making the disciplinary board a permanent and more professional body, chaired by a qualified specialist from outside the Commission; improving the provisions governing the justified suspension of officials, including those being prosecuted in criminal cases in national courts; consolidating the vital coordination between the Commission and OLAF whilst not compromising the essential independence of OLAF; refining the list of possible sanctions to relate them better to any proven contravention of staff regulations. All these proposals are focused on enabling the Commission and the other European institutions, including Parliament, to improve the professionalism, the consistency and the reasonable speed of disciplinary procedures and to do so without loss of fairness or rights of the accused.</p>
<p class="contents">The document on whistle-blowing proposes a system that compares well with the best existing practices in Member States. It proposes the integration of the existing OLAF regulation reporting obligation into the body of the Staff Regulations. It sets out the rights of career protection for whistle-blowers who report genuine concerns in a responsible way. It establishes safeguards against frivolous or malicious reporting. It emphasises the responsibility for those receiving reports of possible wrong-doing to act promptly, seriously and effectively. It defines many clear procedures in several channels for reporting alleged wrong-doing inside and outside an official's employing institution.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition in the right to report to OLAF and to the hierarchy of his or her own institution, an official will also be entitled to report suspicions and evidence to the Presidents of the Council or this Parliament or the Commission or the Court of Auditors or the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of external channels will be a major and progressive change, which I am certain will work to the benefit of the institutions and their staff, the European Union and, of course, the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our equal opportunities document presents specific policy proposals to ensure equality of employment opportunity, so that the evident inequalities, which have been endured by women, by people from ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, can be addressed effectively without compromising standards of merit. In these documents we have again sought to take examples from best practices in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To save time and to recognise portfolio relevance, I hope that the House will accept that it is best at this juncture to leave the salient issues raised in Madame Guy-Quint’s very thorough and very constructive report from the Budget Committee and also the financial management issues highlighted in the equally productive report by Mr Pomés Ruiz to my colleague Commissioner Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">With more time, naturally, I would be very happy to address the matters raised, and I am sure that there will be other opportunities. For now, however, I will focus on just one of Mr Pomés Ruiz's points, one raised by other honourable Members in this debate, namely his question of why the Commission has not acted on the proposal made in a number of Budgetary Control Committee reports that there should be a separate chamber for disciplinary hearings for budgetary irregularities, either within the Court of Auditors or in the Court of Justice. I think Mr Van Hulten made the point in the course of the debate again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fair question and there are basically two reasons for not taking up proposals that the Commission should have recourse to such external institutions. First, the Committee of Independent Experts stipulated, in my view rightly, that any such body should be an internal one, not least because the Treaties attribute very specific roles to the other two institutions in controlling the financial implications and the legality of the Commission's disciplinary decisions. It would create untenable conflicts of interest, not to say some constitutional gymnastics, if either Court were to be directly involved in the Commission's internal procedures. In addition, such changes would obviously only be possible with amendment to the Treaties. Secondly, in practical terms, dividing a disciplinary case up into its financial aspects and its other aspects of conduct, with these matters being heard in different institutions, would have the very undesirable effect of considerably lengthening the disciplinary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the House will agree that these reasons are sound, as the document on discipline this morning shows. In most Member States and in all international organisations, the institution itself is responsible for disciplining its staff. We strongly believe that should remain the case in all the European Union institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the governments and human resources issues of the reports from Mr Lamassoure and Mr Harbour, I regret greatly that time does not permit me on this occasion to make the detailed response, which these reports merit. Suffice it to say at this juncture that I very much welcome both these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Harbour for the very positive and thoughtful approach that he and his committee have taken to the complex issues of the modernisation of human resources policy, both in the Commission and in the other European institutions. The report has given us additional and extremely useful bases for discussion in many of the relevant areas and the opportunity which was provided by the public hearing on human resources policy organised by Mr Harbour offered practices and perceptions from the public and private sectors which were all extremely instructive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend my thanks to Mr Lamassoure for his constructive insights and his constructive remarks on the constitutional context in which the current reform is being pursued. He rightly draws attention to the broad issues and argues that it would have been valuable if the forthcoming governance White Paper could have preceded the proposals for administrative reform. Ideally, of course, he is absolutely right. I know, however, that he and other honourable Members understand that the political priority and the urgency necessarily given to the reform agenda meant that any delay in pursuing that agenda would not have been feasible or acceptable. I am sure, however, that the analysis and the principles that will be set out in the Governance Paper next year will directly inform us, as we complete the design and begin the full implementation of reform and modernising changes over the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">I express my gratitude to all honourable Members for their hard and thoughtful work on the reform issues undertaken over recent months. I also thank them for the quality of the further contributions made in the course of tonight's debate and I am naturally glad to be able to say, with justification, that the hope that I expressed last year that the Commission and this Parliament would sustain an alliance for reform is proving to be absolutely realistic. I thank the House for that too and for your patience this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Commission is a root-and-branch reform process. That is evident from the White Paper, and I believe it is also very plainly evident from the parliamentary reports. The main focal point of the reform is the effort to improve financial management. This is not a matter of localised fine-tuning; no, the changes in this area are profound and substantive. The best news is that major building blocks of the reform process are already in place. They not only exist on paper but have also been implemented in practice. Some building blocks are being chiselled out, while others still have to be approved in formal decisions of Parliament and the Council prior to implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to deal now with important points from the reports by Mrs Guy-Quint and Mr Pomés Ruiz which relate directly to the budget process, namely the drafting of the budget and its implementation. Both of these subjects are examined in the new version of the Financial Regulation. The recast Financial Regulation is at the heart of the reform process. The main aims of the new version are simplification, greater transparency and reinforcement of budgetary principles; in concrete terms, this means fewer exceptions to the rules, fewer incomprehensible special regimes and more efficient and effective budgetary procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">An entirely new feature of the Financial Regulation is the inclusion of rules such as those on the awarding of contracts and on financial aid. In other words, the rules governing everyday budgetary operations have become clearer and will be easier to administer, which – as is our hope and our aim – will cut future error rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Guy-Quint, in your report you referred to many points in the new version of the Financial Regulation, but you also expressed concern that activity-based budgeting might deprive Parliament of information. I believe I can allay this concern. The idea underlying activity-based budgeting is actually to make it clear in the budget how much money is available for operational and necessary administrative expenditure in each policy area. We want to indicate the cost of each policy, and you are right in saying that this does not in itself suffice for a cost-benefit analysis, but it does provide a general review of the funds available for a given policy area, and that is an innovation in the budget of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The abolition of the present division of the budget into administrative and operating appropriations is the logical consequence of this new approach, but it does not mean that staff and administration costs are no longer identifiable, no longer separately labelled. On the contrary, it goes without saying that they will continue to be shown in specific budget lines; they will simply be assigned to the appropriate area of political activity and will no longer lurk anonymously somewhere inside a general administrative budget for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This activity-related approach is designed to harmonise resources more closely with political priorities. It is an instrument with which expenditure can be more accurately estimated and recorded, and it is also a straightforward management tool which can channel managerial activity in a more focused manner on the basis of priorities. It was, after all, one of the main concerns of this very Parliament that political priorities should be made more clearly identifiable. So once again transparency is the aim, and I believe we shall achieve that aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say briefly, Mr Garriga Polledo, that the categories used in the Financial Regulation have been retained. The Regulation is a financial-planning instrument, and as such it has also been retained. Incidentally, I am delighted to note, Mrs Guy-Quint, that you are a specialist in this field who can be relied upon to debate the recast Financial Regulation in Parliament with competence and no doubt with passion too.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to deal with a point on which Mr Pomés Ruiz laid special emphasis in his report, namely the issue of payment targets. You were right, Mr Pomés Ruiz, to emphasise this point so strongly. Last year, only about two thirds of payments were made within the 60-day limit, and I agree with your criticism; this is unacceptable. Admittedly, the number of financial transactions has risen rapidly in recent years, but that is no excuse. It must become a matter of course for the Commission to pay invoices within the prescribed time limit, and this is the target the Commission has set itself. How do we intend to achieve it? I shall mention just a few of the many steps we are taking. For example, contract clauses on invoicing will be simplified, and the Commission will make greater use of flat-rate reimbursement. For one thing, it is simply very uneconomical for the Commission if contracts operate in such a way that 20% of expenditure on item X is reimbursable, while 30% of expenditure on item Y is eligible for reimbursement, not to mention the frequent need for vouchers covering minimal items of expenditure to be collected and checked. The instrument of flat-rate reimbursement saves a great deal of time and money.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is that the date on which the Commission receives an invoice should be clearly specified. For that reason we shall establish a central register in which incoming invoices will be logged, and an entitlement to interest on late payments will be enshrined in the Financial Regulation and in the terms of our contracts. I need hardly add that financial penalties are always a very potent and painful instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of externalisation, may I briefly point out that the Commission will present a legal basis for this. Moreover, in its letter amending the budget, the Commission also gives a detailed opinion on the question of the technical-assistance offices (TAOs), and I am very pleased to see that the ideas of the Commission and those of Parliament on the future treatment of this question run along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Administrative reform is intended to improve the work of the Commission. For this improvement we need good people, good staff, and we need a sufficient number of staff. To that end, the Commission requested additional posts for next year from the budgetary authority, and I am delighted with the decisions that were taken last week in the framework of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">With these reforms the Commission is preparing itself to deal more effectively with its current tasks as well as with new tasks in the future, and it is also, of course, a reform process that will equip the Commission to discharge its new responsibilities in the framework of enlargement. We shall naturally make every effort to implement the reforms as quickly as possible, even though there will be occasional criticism that one or other of these reforms still awaits completion. In those situations it is sometimes forgotten that we also operate within a democratic system and that codecision rules have to be respected – and rightly so. The staff of the Commission are also agents of the reform process, so it has to meet with their acceptance too. It also has to be accepted by the other institutions, and in particular it needs the support of the elected representatives of the people. For that support, whether critical or enthusiastic, may I express my sincere thanks to Parliament. I see that we have evidently launched the reform process in good time, because it is not quite five to twelve yet! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
