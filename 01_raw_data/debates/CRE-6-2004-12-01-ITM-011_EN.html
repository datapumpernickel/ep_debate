As the Council knows, Parliament convened this temporary committee and Mr Böge is its rapporteur; so far we have eight working documents and because as yet they are only working documents, we have not taken any formal positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully the questions that we put before the Council and the responses that we get back will help us reach some conclusions. Having said that, to be perfectly honest, I hope that when Parliament does make its decisions there are certain items that it will be resolute about.</p>
<p class="contents">In the previous Parliament, in a report that was voted in my name, we set out certain conditions, certain priorities, one of which was quite simple: there will be no interinstitutional agreement without the agreement of Parliament. The Council is well aware of this but it needs to be stressed, as it is in the text of this oral question. We have also the issue of the length of the proposed financial perspective and Parliament will, I am pretty sure, bring it down to something like five years rather than seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">More important is the position of a fallback. Mr Böge asks in one of his working documents: what are the options if we cannot come to an agreement with the Council? Do we go for Article 26 of the IIA or do we go for Article 272 of the Treaty?’</p>
<p class="contents">Having been in this Parliament for the past 15 years and involved with the Committee on Budgets for all that time, I am pretty sure that Parliament will go for Article 272. That message needs to be got across to the Council. I know that you, Mr Nicolaï, are well aware of that and also of the consequences if we do not reach an agreement. Therefore, it is incumbent on both our institutions to make sure that we reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving away from the oral question for one moment, I am now the rapporteur for the discharge, and it is becoming obvious that Parliament’s budget gets a bad press every November when the Court of Auditors report is produced. I would hope that the institutions – and if not the institutions then at least I hope Parliament – can make a decision that we will not conclude an interinstitutional agreement until the budgetary authority has agreed a solution to the audit, to the legality and regularity of the European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no use concluding a financial perspective that will be seen by the general public as being misspent, misused and irregular throughout the next five, six, seven years or whatever period we agree to.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the questions; they are there for everyone to see and are quite simple. The first one is: ‘How does the Council intend to cooperate with Parliament?’ We are talking about how we are going to work together. Hopefully we will not work as two separate organisations and there will be some work in tandem, so that we can share our ideas and make sure that the building-block approach of the Council matches our own approach as set out in Mr Böge’s working documents.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a question about the calendar of the Presidency, when you hope to conclude, what your present Netherlands Presidency hopes to achieve, and what you think the next Presidency will achieve by the middle of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">We mentioned the issue of trialogues, but it is fair to say that after an informal meeting we had this morning, Mr Nicolaï, you may give us a response to that. Parliament’s position right now is that we should be having monthly trialogues, but I am sure your response will enlighten us on your thinking on this. I personally go some way towards your sentiments on this.</p>
<p class="contents">An important issue is the question regarding the ‘Prodi package’. We really need to know where the Council is coming from. What is the basis for your building blocks? What is the basis for your working documents? Is it the Prodi package or are you taking a different approach?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last question: ‘In the Council’s view, what connection exists between the Commission’s proposals on the new financial perspective and the issue of own resources?’ Some of us, being British, are not bothered, but for the majority in this House it is a crucial issue. On that, Mr Nicolaï, we would appreciate some answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was not the nicest way to begin a debate in the European Parliament, because I believe we will reach agreement with Parliament on the financial perspective on time. As Mr Borrell and Mr Wynn pointed out, the next financial perspectives represent one of the weightiest and most significant dossiers currently facing the Union. The Council is therefore grateful to have been given the chance of setting out briefly how it is envisaged that this dossier should be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the timetable for finalising work was laid out in the Multiannual Strategic Programme for 2004-2006, adopted by the European Council in December 2003. Thus, with the majority of the Commission’s financial and legislative proposals already on the table, work is currently under way within the Council, aimed at possibly reaching decisions on principles and guidelines this month. The intention is to achieve political agreement before the June 2005 European Council so that both the framework itself and the detailed legislation can finally be adopted by the end of 2005. Preparatory work on new Community programmes would thereafter be carried out throughout 2006 so that they could be implemented from the beginning of the new financial perspective period.</p>
<p class="contents">As already mentioned, after producing two overall communications – one in February and a follow-up in July – the Commission has also presented a package of detailed proposals setting out the legal framework for key policy areas. These include cohesion policy, conservation and management of natural resources, Lisbon-related issues and external relations and will be completed by a small number of additional proposals concerning in particular freedom, security and justice, and research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council wishes to reassure Mr Borrell that the Commission’s proposal constitutes the basis for work in the Council and is in accordance with normal institutional practice. However, I think you will agree that, again in accordance with normal institutional practice, it is open to any Member State to agree or disagree to a greater or lesser extent with the financial implications of a Commission proposal and thus endeavour to move the dossier in a direction more agreeable to it. This is part of the normal process of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Union’s own resources are concerned, the Commission has submitted as part of its legislative package a report on the operation of the own-resources system as well as two proposals. These proposals make provision <span class="italic">inter alia</span> for the possibility of new tax-based own resources to be operational as from 2014, as well as for a generalised correction mechanism. Preliminary work on these proposals has started and it is generally agreed that the concept of the globality of the financial perspective negotiations implies not only that individual policy areas must be viewed together in the context of overall expenditure, but also that expenditure must be seen in the context of the overall negotiations, including the question of own resources in all its aspects. The Council also recalls in this connection that own resources formed an integral part of the 1999 Berlin agreement on which the current financial perspective is based.</p>
<p class="contents">On cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament, it should be recalled that, as specified in the joint declaration of July referred to by Mr Wynn and Mr Borrell, the Council is committed to an exchange of information with the European Parliament throughout the process. The precise arrangements for putting this into practice will need to be established by common agreement between the parties. The Council continues to act in accordance with the terms of the July declaration whereby the financial perspective should be negotiated in a spirit of loyal institutional cooperation, with the institutions willing to take all measures necessary for successful completion of the procedure leading to its adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">The partners accordingly need to reflect on how best to give concrete expression to this spirit of cooperation, which will certainly need to deepen as negotiations within the Council intensify and firmer Council positions take shape. The Council could, to this end, draw inspiration from constructive practices followed during the last financial perspective negotiations, which enabled a satisfactory dialogue to take place with the European Parliament, culminating in the adoption of the current interinstitutional agreement in May 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, to conclude I wish to refer to the idea, also mentioned by Mr Wynn, of holding a monthly trialogue. Based on my experience as President-in-Office, I should like to stress that the Council, and therefore the President-in-Office, will not be able to take a position in such a formal setting. The negotiations in the Council are ongoing and difficult, as you know. In such a context it would be preferable to continue the current practice of informal contacts between the presidency and representatives of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that these contacts will be fruitful and enable our institutions to play our respective roles. Furthermore, you can be sure that the Council will look very carefully at the content of relevant resolutions and use them in its deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Böge (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we do indeed want the negotiations on the Financial Perspective and the European Union’s political priorities to produce agreement in good time, but we want an agreement that, at the same time, does justice to the demands that are made on the new and enlarged European Union. So let me tell you, as rapporteur for the temporary committee, that the quality of the agreement is also more important than the deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the discussions with Parliament’s specialist committees as our basis, we in the temporary committee are trying to define the political priorities for the years to come, and to put forward the upper limits for the structure of the European Budget, thereby laying down this House’s negotiating position ready for its discussions with the Council. By doing this, we want to guarantee that, on the one hand, of course, traditional policies will be no less important and, on the other, that the European Union will present itself better, both internally and externally, and finally become what the Constitutional Treaty defines it as being – a Union of citizens and states. That is why we are discussing among ourselves the political priorities on the basis of what value they add to Europe, and talking about how the European Budget can take greater account than hitherto of the Lisbon objectives, such as growth, employment and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I see it as very important, in the light of past experience, that we should make it very clear that we want agreement to be reached in good time, thus preventing us from getting into difficulties – not so much with the Budget as with the legislative process. Let me say, though, that we could end up, in the course of the coming year, with a worst case scenario, and then we will all need to have safety nets at the ready, such as those provided for the Budget in the Treaties and the Regulations, namely Article 26 of the Inter-Institutional Agreement or Article 272 of the Treaty. At the same time, though, we will have to guarantee that, if the worst comes to the worst, it is made clear that the legal bases for structural funds and for multiannual programmes will also be extended if need be, that is to say, if there is no alternative. Perhaps the mere announcement of safety nets and alternatives of this kind and the fact that we are discussing them will help all the parties involved to become aware of their responsibilities and – with next year’s referendums in sight – will help to make it clear that we in the European institutions are willing and able to announce, at the right time, that we have succeeded in reaching agreement on the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to echo what was said by Mr Wynn, the first deputy chairman of the temporary committee. The issue of the Statement of Assurance is important, as is that of how we handle the financial regulation that has just entered into force, and these must, in this context, be sorted out alongside each other. This is not just about the upper limits, commitments and payment appropriations, but also about how the Commission, and also the Member States, manage the Budget as a whole. That is why we will also, in this context, have to discuss the Court of Auditors’ Statement of Assurance and the issue of the financial regulation, and also whether, at the end of the day, financial programming should be for seven years or for four.

<p class="contents">I agree with previous speakers, but I am not going to expand on that; I would like to focus on other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The news reaching us from the Council is at times imprecise and partial, often because that institution tends to be rather secretive. I believe, therefore, that this oral question is useful to us in terms of clarifying certain issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that certain Member States have asked that payment appropriations for the next financial perspectives be below a certain percentage of the Union’s gross national product. We have also heard rumours that other States defend that maximum, but applied to commitment appropriations, although it is not clear whether they are doing so in order to test the waters or whether they are truly convinced that that is sufficient to cover the real needs of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that some people have the fundamental political objective of getting their minimal proposals accepted and then imposing ‘the necessary cuts’ in order to achieve those minimums. Could you tell us, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether this method consisting of setting limits on resources and then making cuts also corresponds to a method you use in your deliberations? If this is the case, it does not frighten us, because we suffer the same thing every year when we approve the draft annual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what in English is known as the ‘building block’ method, which has prevailed in your work to date, and what has been the result?</p>

He believes in dialogue and is convinced that we will reach agreement. The only conclusion I can draw from that is that he has distanced himself from the misbegotten requirement to have the budget at 1% of GDP, because that would, after all, render an agreement impossible. Fortunately, he has abandoned this scheme, because it goes without saying that a larger European Union tackling more problems needs more funds. Naturally, I do not have complete peace of mind yet, because there are plenty of Finance Ministers who mainly view 2006 as a basis for the budget of 2007 and think that the 2006 budget should certainly not exceed that of 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">My group takes a different approach to these matters. We look ahead to 2013 and to what we want to have achieved by that time. To the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Commission’s proposal forms a sound basis, but one that needs fleshing out quite a bit. That can be done, for example, by means of investments in the area of rural development, the environment, sustainable energy, research and exchange programmes for young people, teachers and artists. We also attach importance to flexibility. We need a framework which will enable us to meet the EU’s challenges, including those of 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to my group that we should not only discuss the EU’s expenditure but also its revenue. The President of the Council spoke about a number of minor adjustments a moment ago, such as the limit on net contributions, but we also, of course, require something far more fundamental. These days, this whole discussion of net contributions often leads to irritation and to irrational spending, because much compensatory action is needed, and also to a budget that is far too low.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore discuss revenue on a more serious level. We should discuss a minimum tariff on environmental pollution or company tax which is siphoned off directly to the European Union. In that case, that amount is not added to national tax but replaces it. That will only benefit a rational discussion about the EU’s expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish, in this House, to summarise my position, which is different from that which emerged in the temporary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the idea of there needing to be a ceiling on expenditure during the forthcoming seven-year period up until 2013. In my view, it is important to have such a ceiling, which should apply not only to expenses and payments but also to commitments. I think it important not simply to dismiss this view, which only six out of twenty-five countries are said to have supported, for the countries concerned are those that make major net contributions. It should be emphasised that unity is required on this issue if it is to be possible to adopt a financial framework and that there is a very strong desire not to impose unduly heavy burdens upon national taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also regrettable that the Prodi Commission’s old report was taken as the basis for the Commission’s proposal. I believe that the basis should have been the one per cent target but that Parliament must, however, have a large influence on the distribution of resources within this framework. In other words, this is not a tactic for moving resources to one area or another. It is only within such a framework that a true prioritising of resources can be brought about.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the seven-year plan because it provides regulations for budgeting in each country, an activity funded not by the European Parliament but by the national parliaments. We are clearly opposed to the EU’s introducing its own forms of taxation, for that would lead to a loss of overall control of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise our belief that agriculture should not be exempt from such re-planning as is necessary if it is to be possible to invest in new areas. Such re-planning will provide scope for many new initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A litmus test makes evaluation possible.

Will it be possible to achieve the breakthroughs that are needed in education? Will it be possible to make real savings in administration, without more new concealed channels being found? On that will depend the amount of money that will actually be involved.

<p class="contents">The question today focuses on certain issues on which there is undoubtedly no fundamental neutrality: firstly, the participation of the European Parliament, as several Members have stressed, such as Mr Böge – and I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement of good intentions – and, secondly, the working timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">For many reasons, Mr President, whether the work ends in an agreement in 2005 or in 2006 is important because, if we are obliged to defer the budget, as the Commissioner responsible for the budget acknowledged yesterday, it will be the cohesion policy that pays the price. I would, therefore, like to draw the attention of certain Members to the risk to solidarity in the European Union of having an unjustified showdown between the European Parliament and the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to reach an agreement during the Luxembourg Presidency. I would, therefore, like the Dutch Presidency to tell us how work is going on approving the general lines of the reform at the European Council on the 17 December. We are delighted that the Presidency has said that the basis for this debate will be the European Commission's proposal, but how do those of you who claim to be Europeanists intend to deal with the cost of enlargement, expand internal and external Community policies and at the same time reduce the European Union's budgetary spending?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether you have a magic wand or the capacity to perform miracles, or whether perhaps you intend to destroy cohesion for the old Member States, in other words, make the poor regions of the statistically or genuinely rich countries meet the cost of the economic development of the poor regions of the new Member countries.</p>
<p class="contents">You have less than two weeks to answer these questions if you do not want the Dutch Presidency to be tarnished at the end of its term in office. You should start thinking about how to justify wanting more Europe while spending less money, because nobody understands that. What we do understand very well is that less money means less Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As many have said, what we are dealing with now is one of the greatest challenges we face, second only to the annual deliberations on the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If one is to accept such a great challenge, one already associated with such bellicose language and accompanied – in that figures have already been produced for our consideration – by the opening of many secondary theatres of war, it is a good thing to keep a cool head and work through things in a systematic fashion. I can assure you that there are many in this House who will approach this matter with a calm mind, rather than allowing themselves to be distracted. Our task is to see to it that this House is sufficiently involved, and we will of course insist on that through the proper channels and press the point if the need to do so arises.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues and I are very grateful to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for having refrained from playing games with numbers and for having adopted a ‘building block’ approach, which focuses attention on matters of substance. You have said that we have to closely examine the individual policy areas in order to see what we can actually do, and what we want for Europe in the future, and the work you are doing reflects that. We will work in parallel with you and make proposals where necessary, hoping that you will take account of them in your calculations during the process rather than only when it is drawing to a close.</p>
<p class="contents">There will inevitably be many questions in our own minds, those being the questions raised by the European policy of the future, and the public demand answers to them. We will, in future, have new tasks to take upon ourselves, and we will also have to talk about whether the existing policies as set down to date were shaped in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not be abandoning principles, and one that we do not believe can be abandoned is that of cohesion in this Europe of ours. It is in areas such as this, for example, that there is discussion as to whether we want to make universal provision – as we have done in the past – or whether we want to promote lighthouses and centres of growth. This we will have to discuss with you, and a discussion of this kind, dealing with details and substance, calls for courage. It will demand courage of the Council, for it is the Council that will have to say when certain things are to be sold to the public as European tasks, one example being the reinforcement of security in the wake of 11 September, and another being cooperation in the foreign policy sphere, for which funding will be needed. We, Members of the European Parliament, will also need the courage to repatriate to the national level certain things that are not best performed at European level. We will have to have a debate about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give brief consideration to the issue of duration, which two speakers have already addressed. The fact is that the seven years we are talking about – a period running until 2013 – amounts to nine years from today. Just bear in mind that it is for a period of nine years that we will be making estimates; nine years ago, Michael Jackson’s <span class="italic">Earth Song</span> was number one in the hit parades, the word ‘euro’ had only just been invented, and it was nine years ago that Austria, Sweden and Finland joined the European Union. That was nine years ago! As we now have to talk in terms of that sort of period running into the future, I do think we have to watch out. We should in fact be putting this duration back under the microscope. Four years or three years would be something else. It was four years ago that we adopted the Treaty of Nice. That is a manageable period of time, so let us talk about the periods for which the Financial Perspective might run.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also, though, discuss the issue of flexibility, which we need. The European Union’s development is not linear; we need change. Over past months, we have had, again and again, to make use of the flexibility instrument. You know every bit as well as we do that discussion of that is on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to address the issue of the revenue side, for an MEP cannot be happy to be always given the task of maximising expenditure, that being assumed to be the only thing we are interested in. Such is not the case! If we are to talk in terms of net contributors and net burdens, we want to know whether the engines pulling us are capable of having more wagons attached to them until they are incapable of moving, or how we can raise the money. So something else we want to discuss with you is the mechanisms that the revenue side requires, and what I would like you to tell us is whether you are willing to have us involved over and above the extent specified in the Treaty, whether you are willing to talk to us and take us seriously where expenditure and revenue are concerned, or whether that is where you want us to be completely detached.

Along with the financial perspective, the system of the EU’s own resources is to be reformed, as are several multi-annual programmes, including regional and structural policy. All this will require an immense amount of work and familiarisation with the new arrangements on the part of Parliament, and good levels of cooperation from the different European Union institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Some tough negotiations are to be expected on the financial perspective. It is important that Parliament is not put under any pressure in these talks, although there have already been signs of that. If there is no agreement on the financial perspective by the time of the deadline, the EU budget can be drafted reasonably successfully on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty. Of course, in that case the measures aimed at improving employment would be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">The incomplete state of the financial perspective must not be an excuse for stonewalling legislative proposals.

We do so even though he has concealed from us the fact that, at the Spanish-German summit a few days ago, another timetable was referred to, with 2006 as the date set for agreement. What that means is that they are juggling two timetables, and, speaking as a regional politician, I can only describe that as irresponsible. The regions need to be able to plan ahead with confidence. If regional planning comes to an end at the end of 2006, there will then be funds committed for only another year. What we need instead is for the relevant preparations to be made two years in advance, thus making it possible for structural assistance to be paid out in good time, for if this is not done, there will be a black hole in support funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is annuality any sort of solution for regional politicians, and so we all, in the eyes of the public, share responsibility, but the European Parliament will come to an agreement next year, and so the question that arises in my mind is that of what the Council proposes to do, and what you, in particular, are doing in the last days of your Presidency to stir the Member States into action at last. On the assumption that you have got a move on – and I am given to understand today that you have – how do you get the others to do likewise? The only way we can continue with this debate in a responsible way is if you really do take some action, rather than merely engaging in the cautious diplomacy we have seen to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The opposite is actually the case, as the EU aggravates and precipitates these difficulties, and gives rise to even greater differences, discrepancies and conflicts. In economic terms, Europe is confronted with two basic problems. The first is economic growth, which as a rule is slower in Europe than in the United States and Asia, with consequences such as high levels of unemployment and a fall in the competitiveness of businesses. The second is the growing difference in income levels between the rich old Europe and the poor new Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also two main problems with regard to social issues. The first relates to values. I have in mind the crisis of the family as a key institution. This is linked to the second problem, namely the ageing of societies and Europe’s falling population. These demographic problems do not only affect Belgium, Germany and France but also poor countries, such as Ukraine, Romania and Poland. If we consider the EU’s actions or proposed actions in this field, it becomes apparent that the EU lacks a vision of how to solve problems relating to economic growth and reducing differences, for example. Above all, the EU lacks a strategy for reversing the trend of Europe’s depopulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Have there been any changes to the 2005-2006 draft budget as a result of the fact that ten new countries have joined the EU, and that the number of its citizens has increased from 380 million to 450 million, or by nearly 20%? No, there have been no changes. The 2005-2006 budget is based on an increase in expenditure of less than 10%, which, corrected for inflation, is in fact less than 7%, and equivalent to the contributions made by the new Member States. 2005 and 2006 are therefore lost years in terms of EU integration, and, worse still, differences may even be exacerbated. In the context of the budget forecasts for 2007-2013, this is a very bad sign. Was the 2007-2013 budget negotiated and agreed with the new Member States? Of course it was not, as it was submitted to Parliament by the outgoing Commissioners. What is more, the debate on this draft is taking place within a temporary parliamentary committee, which was appointed to undermine the existing Committee on Budgets and spread the responsibility for whichever solution was adopted. This is evidence of the way in which the EU’s procedures lack transparency and clarity. It also illustrated the horse-trading that goes on within, the Council, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective provide no answer to Europe’s basic problems. If we adopt the principle that the budget will be set at 1% of GDP, the economic divide will only be widened. Worse still, as a result of the Lisbon strategy, expenditure on research and development will increase by 300%, with these funds going mainly to the old EU Member States, whereas expenditure on the Structural and Cohesion Funds will increase by only 30%, which means that backward countries will lag ever further behind highly--developed countries. We advocate a free, safe and rapidly developing Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Many of the key documents of the European Union are full of good intentions. This goes for the Lisbon strategy and doubly so for the financial perspectives setting out the new financial framework of the enlarged European Union for the period 2007 – 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps this is why we are now witnessing a slowing down in the economic growth of the Eurozone in comparison with our main world competitors. During the 1990s, when the 15 Member States of the European Union were making a particular effort to flood the markets of the Eastern European countries, the average annual growth in productivity was 2.3%. Now it is just 1.2% per annum and productivity in the Eurozone is more than a third lower than in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I welcome the appearance of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Borrell at the meeting of the European Council, where he explicitly pointed out the discrepancies between the Lisbon strategy and reality. This is a real threat to any kind of financial perspective if it is not backed up by real implementation. Any discussion about the new financial perspective cannot be confined to the financial frameworks and the intentions of the European Union but must consider the effective use of common resources and concrete measures to raise the level of competitiveness of the EU.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as the amount of financing is concerned, it is clear that requirements due to the enlargement of the European Union are increasing. That is why we need to look first at the priorities of the new enlarged Union and then to start to talk about financing quotas. I fear that, in certain cases, exactly the opposite happens. However, in all events, enlargement should not operate to the detriment of the current cohesion countries and should not operate to the detriment of the cohesion policies of the European Union. Within this framework, I welcome the European Parliament's position that the Union needs satisfactory financing for the future, even though I am keeping a personal reservation for when we start discussing specific numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern is with the timetable. Mr Nicolaï transmitted to us the Council's firm position that the objective is for us to finish in June. I hope that is the case. However, as you know and as certain honourable Members mentioned, there are rumours to the contrary. I do not think this is a good thing for the Union budget overall, especially for multiannual programmes such as those of the Structural Funds. Any delay here would have an adverse impact, because we need to know the regulations much earlier; the Member States and the regions need to prepare so that we do not lose time, as happened in the current programming period in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Alternative solutions to extend the budget would appear to me to be extremely difficult. However, any alternative solutions would have an extremely adverse impact on the operation of the Structural Funds and on cohesion policies from 2007 onwards. That is why I should like a clear position by the Council on the timetable and on the alternative solutions which, in my opinion, are out of the question for the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns the European Union's capacity to respond to the needs of its peoples and the challenges of the twenty-first century. The proposals submitted by the previous European Commission are, in our view, a good and balanced basis for discussion. However, the restrictive, accountant's approach taken by certain governments and the proclamation of 1% as a dogmatic objective are unacceptable at this stage of the negotiations. We are truly worried by the Council's apparent inability to respond effectively to the need to safeguard the development and redistributive character of the Community budget; this is something that, unfortunately, we noted once again during the budgetary procedure for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of reliability arises when we call on the peoples of Europe to ratify the European Constitution, when we talk about speeding up the Lisbon strategy and we are not ready to make corresponding commitments about the financial resources for implementing these objectives. This is deceiving the citizens of the European Union. The Community budget which met the needs of the European Union of the 15 Member States cannot efficiently meet the needs of the Union of 25 Member States today or of 27 tomorrow. We, as the European Parliament, want there to be an agreement in good time, during 2005, on the financial perspectives which will guarantee the necessary and adequate financing for the policies of the European Union. We shall be working in this direction and we call on the Council too to stand up to its responsibilities. However, we wish to make clear that only a good and efficient agreement will be politically acceptable, an agreement which will efficiently safeguard development, employment, cohesion and solidarity for all citizens and all regions of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is preferable to falling back on some article or other, be it in the Treaty or elsewhere. That is why I believe it is to be welcomed that the Council intends to develop these new financial perspectives in thorough consultation and consensus with Parliament and to meet regularly for that purpose. I think that what the financial perspectives of the future could benefit from is more flexibility between the chapters. The Council could question, however, whether that is dangerous. I do not think so. After all, we have, with the current forms of flexibility, always stayed far below the standards which the agreement provide for.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area of concern is cofinancing. Not all components of the budget are being ‘cofinanced’. Some are, some are not.

<p class="contents">In conclusion, we take a positive view of the Prodi package, particularly because of the new philosophy on which it is based, focusing on the creation of a competitive and growing Union, and, in our view, the own-resource ceiling cannot be brought down to below 1.27% if we want to achieve all our pre-established objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first matter giving rise to questions is this – why does regional policy have secondary status in the Prodi Commission’s proposal and why is it not a priority, as it has been until now? Possibly in order to obscure the fact that the amount of resources that the Prodi Commission wishes to devote to regional policy as a proportion of the gross domestic product of the European Union is falling every year.</p>
<p class="contents">The proportion allocated to regional policy in the European Union budget for the next financial perspective is at approximately the same level as it was previously. In a situation where ten new Member States have already joined the European Union and where Romania and Bulgaria will be joining in 2007 the funds available for regional policy should be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we would like to hear the European Council of Ministers answer this important question: does the European Council of Ministers consider it possible to renew priority status for regional policy and does it consider that the amount of funds allocated to European regional policy in the Prodi Commission’s proposal is adequate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too assume that solidarity should be the guiding principle for the distribution of cohesion funds in the enlarged EU. I would therefore like to draw the Council’s attention to two aspects of the Commission proposal which I find need further consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, does the Council consider as adequate the method proposed by the Commission for calculating the GNI average for the 4% capping for the whole seven-year period of the financial perspective? At the same time, for the other aspect of the cohesion policy, provision is made for a mid-term review to adjust the regions’ eligibility according to their actual development. As it stands, on the one hand the Commission proposals are flexible for the phasing-out and phasing-in regions, but on the other hand it leaves the countries and regions for which capping is proposed in a sort of straitjacket for the whole seven-year period. I propose that the mid-term review granting some flexibility and adjustment to the actual growth of GNI should be considered for capping-designated countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does the Council consider feasible the Commission’s legal proposal whereby value-added tax would no longer be eligible for local government projects? Such a proposal would further limit the least-developed municipalities’ opportunities to benefit from the European projects as it weighs heavily on their scant resources. I draw your attention to the fact that under the present system they are exempt from VAT. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament should point out to the Commission – and to the Council – that, over and above the purely quantitative method for strengthening the Lisbon strategy, there is also the question of European participation in the quality of global economic parameters, because quantitative data only allow us to look at economic growth statically, without any positive or negative coefficients. Consequently, we should be looking at the Commission's proposals from the dynamic point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">One example clearly illustrates what I mean: research and technology. According to the Commission, spending on this sector in Europe up to 2013 will rise to EUR 23 billion. What does this mean in relation to the global environment? At the moment, in the United States, we have 2.7%. However, there entrepreneurship has been strengthened so much because there are connections, what we call 'linkages' between businesses, the administration and the economy in the area as a whole. 2.7% is a higher coefficient than our current 2% in Europe, which we shall, of course, push up to 3%. However, Japan, for example, has 3% and, precisely because it does not have these linkages, is now in recession and research and technology has not helped at all in getting it out of recession. Consequently, it is research and technology, this important part, which is a necessary but inadequate condition for growth. Two further preconditions are needed, the dissemination of technology – the linkages I mentioned – and, at the same time, the major problem in my view is that there must be recovery, because in times of recession, businesses – I am still referring to the 'research and technology' problem – only look at things from the point of view of their cash flow management and they are unable to push ahead with major technological inventions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I consider that we should work on another part, which is called 'the demand side'. If the demand side is to work properly, there must be cooperation between what is now the single monetary policy and financial policy. In other words, more attention needs to be paid to the broad economic policy guidelines than that which, as States, we pay to our spending policies, by which I mean not every three or four years but every year, so that we can achieve recovery, without which we shall be pouring all this money we are debating into the Danaides' cistern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to draw attention to this point, as it has mainly been representatives of the old Member States who have spoken so far in the debate, and this is an important distinction to make, as the views of the old and the new Member States on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective differ greatly. In my opinion, one of the most important priorities for this Perspective should be to consolidate economic growth in the ten new Member States, which is currently experiencing an upturn, as this will facilitate cohesion and equality within the EU as a whole. Integration has taken place on a legal and institutional level. This process must, however, be accompanied by one in which the ten poorest countries together with the two due to join the EU in the near future catch up with the developed part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a gradual reduction in the development gap between the rich and the poor, the integration of the EU as a whole will run up against major opposition. There is also a danger of a two-speed Europe becoming a permanent arrangement. This is why we are in favour of the Prodi Commission’s proposal. The latter sets the EU’s budgetary commitments at an average of 1.27% of the EU’s GDP, whilst being opposed to the position of the six largest net payers, who wish to limit the level of these commitments to 1% of GDP. Only if the EU’s budget is greater than it has been to date will there be a realistic chance of significantly increasing funding under the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which would in turn make it possible to implement measures that effectively promote development in the new Member States. This is all the more necessary in view of the planned generosity towards regions in the old EU Member States which as a result of the ‘statistical effect’ will rise above the threshold of 75% of the EU’s average GDP as of 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the restriction that has existed since the mid-1990s, namely that countries benefiting from the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot receive funding exceeding 4% of their GDP, or in other words more than around EUR 17 billion per year for the ten new Member States overall, we are not calling for anything out of the ordinary. I should like to draw these issues to the attention of the Council representatives taking part in this debate, as they are related to the implementation of one of the enlarged EU’s most important priorities, namely reducing the development gap between the old and the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted that Mr Nicolaï from the Council has indicated that we will be doing this more frequently in future and that we will, every month, have the opportunity to put our fingers on the pulse. Nevertheless, this new Parliament has set very clear priorities with a view to pursuing the cohesion policy, because that proved effective in the past and because it has narrowed the gap between the differences between us in Europe. Alongside this, new initiatives, including the Lisbon agenda, have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still not performing well, though. The Kok report has shown quite emphatically that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels, but need to invest. We need to do this at European level with renewed dynamism and right across Europe. There are also new challenges ahead. Today, for example, we were discussing the issue of Ukraine, and the new neighbourhood policy needs fleshing out; it needs investments. Those are new challenges and this House wants to meet them head on.</p>
<p class="contents">My message is that we should draw lessons from what has happened in 1999, particularly in terms of regional policy. The first year, 1999, was not a productive year because the discussions we held were too tentative and too protracted. We must avoid 2007 being another tentative year, especially since the key objectives, if anything, require acceleration. We will therefore need to muster perseverance as a group. It is precisely the linking of instruments, a more integral approach to matters such as research, that opens up opportunities. That is the sort of attitude that the electorate expects of us. Fresh policy and new perspectives cannot be achieved with 1%. We will need more than that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament and the Commission are both new, and the EU has only been functioning with 25 Member States for seven months. There is also the prospect of further enlargements, and of course the Lisbon Strategy to take into account. The temporary committee’s timetable and working methods should include an examination of the positions and priorities of the Prodi Commission and the previous Parliament. An assessment of the current enlargement should also be carried out, and plans made for future enlargements. These are tasks to be tackled by the new European Commission, with the Member States playing a major role. The latter’s proposals must be studied thoroughly, and it is for the next Presidency to ensure that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Financial Perspective contains plans for several years, and maybe for as long as a decade or more. It is possible, and indeed certain, that conditions within the EU and beyond will have changed. After all, this is a long time, especially in the twenty-first century. It would therefore be a good idea for there to be a review of the new Financial Perspective after it has been in operation for three years, and for it to be adjusted as necessary. It should not be forgotten that in 2009 there will be a new Parliament and a new European Commission, and provision should be made now for those key EU institutions to have the right to put forward proposals and make certain amendments. The fundamental decisions on the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, however, are a matter for the Member States and the Council. Europe cannot be reduced to mere percentages, and in particular not to 1% of GDP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me start by responding to the issue of the timing, the timeframe and planning which we in the Council follow and has been questioned by some of you, first of all by Mr Böge, but subsequently also by Mrs Schroedter and Mr Hatzidakis. The latter two also spoke about rumours and indications that the timeframe which I gave you a moment ago would have been altered. Reference was made to a summit and to other rumours. I can put your minds at rest. There is only one timeframe and it is the one I presented to you. It mainly comes down to the fact that indeed, it is our plan and intention to achieve agreement in the Council by June 2005. I can add to this that I agree with what Mr Böge said about the continued non-appearance of the Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors. He knows, as you do, that we in the Council share Parliament’s concern about this. Some of you, including Mr Galeote Quecedo, have enquired after the precise state of affairs in connection with the timing and the schedule. The state of affairs is that the preparations for the Council of 17 December are now underway and that we will then do as agreed. That means that we then hope to take a decision about the principles and guidelines for the financial perspectives, as well as the package, the survey of what we have achieved by means of the building-block approach. That is what is before the Council and it is hoped that we can take a decision on this on 17 December. I will return to this building-block approach in a moment, because a number of questions are linked to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that here too, rather like in the discussions in the Council, various priorities as to content are already being mentioned at this stage which should find a home in the new financial perspectives. As Mr Böge made explicit, one general point of departure is the discussion about the added value of what is happening at European level. I naturally recognise a number of priorities that have been presented, including the Lisbon strategy, that has been mentioned by many, the international role of the European Union, cohesion policy, security and specifically also the item of the 4% cap on structural funds. Those are all elements that are still being discussed here, as they are in the Council, and form part of the proposals we are in the process of formulating.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the approach which we in the Presidency have decided to adopt for the steps to be taken during these six months in preparing the new financial perspectives. First of all, I should like to distance myself quite categorically from the questions about the 1% approach put by, among others, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mrs Buitenweg, who was delighted that this approach would be abandoned. As President of the Council, I have not abandoned anything, and neither have I held on to anything. I am not speaking here on behalf of the Netherlands, nor on behalf of the Group of Six, who, as you know, have adopted this position about the 1%. I am addressing you as President of the Council. As President, I have done precisely those things that a number of you regard as grounds for criticism, Mr Karas, for example, who urged me to talk about priorities, or others who questioned how I could solve this problem from a financial point of view. We have opted for the building-block approach, precisely because it allows the political priorities, the priorities as to content, and not the money, to be put first. That is the step that we are now trying to achieve by 17 December, so this is exactly along the lines of many remarks which I have made in the past. Since I seem to perceive some confusion about this, I should like to reiterate that the Commission proposal is very definitely the point of departure, although we all know that the Member States are entitled to adopt positions other than that proposed by the Commission. What the building-block approach tries to do quite simply is to combine, classify and put into a readily understood format the different positions of different Member States in terms of category and subject, thus enabling us in the Council to make more informed decisions politically speaking. That will only benefit the discussion as a whole and may even be advantageous to you. I am therefore delighted to hear, as Mr Walter made explicit, that Parliament will venture a similar attempt. I think that with this, I have responded to most remarks about the building-block approach and the line taken by the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn my attention to the other aspect. Not expenditure, but revenue and own resources, which one or two of you briefly mentioned. We all agree on how important these are. Parliament’s right to be consulted is unmistakable and abundantly obvious and there is no doubt as to the fact that you will be making use of it where this section of the financial perspectives is concerned. One or two Members of this House also mentioned the generic correction mechanism. That is all covered by the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Buitenweg specifically mentioned Eurotax. The Commission proposed to open this possibility for the next financial perspectives in 2014. I can inform you that the Council is currently discussing that and that it will continue to do so. By way of update on the discussion, I can inform you that it is unlikely that the Council will argue in favour of bringing this date forward any earlier than proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Another specific point that has been mentioned by a number of you – Mrs Jensen, I believe was the first one, but Mr Walter and others followed suit – concerns the duration of the financial perspectives and the seven-year term. The Commission has proposed to apply the seven-year term once more, and this is also still being discussed in the Council. We have not adopted a position on this. You know just as I do that the multi-annual budget is a framework within which the annual provisions are made. We do not lay down everything in exact detail for seven years, or however many years, but I do not need to tell you that. What matters are the ceilings within which there is scope for annual allocations, provided that the margins are sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am looking forward to working with the European Parliament, for the remaining time that I will be in the role of President. I am also saying this on behalf of the Council. We will not be accepting foregone conclusions, as some of you fear. First of all, at all times, but certainly now during the preparations of these financial perspectives, the Council listens very carefully to the opinions, remarks, signals or resolutions in the European Parliament. I cannot speak formally on behalf of the Luxembourg Presidency, but I can say that it seems a good idea to me to continue the informal way in which contacts between Council and the European Parliament have been established during the preparatory stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to my last remark. I do not entertain the worst-case scenarios one or two in this House have suggested in connection with the question as to what we will do if things do not go to plan. We should beware of a self-fulfilling prophecy and should consider how we dealt with confrontation between the European Parliament and the Council about the annual budget. As you know, the negotiations were tough and in a tense atmosphere. If truth be told, the Council’s and Parliament’s starting positions were very different, but we have struck a sound compromise. This compromise is beneficial to the European Parliament, to the Council and, above all, to Europe, and all of this on time despite tense negotiations. I think that that should be an example of how we can look toward the multi-annual budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
