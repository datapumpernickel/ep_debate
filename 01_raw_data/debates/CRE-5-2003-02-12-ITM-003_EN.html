<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>.<span class="italic"> </span>– <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, ladies and gentlemen, one month ago I presented our Spring Report to you and, today, I am here to listen and to discuss the main points in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy is already bringing positive results, but we are still not harnessing the Union's full potential in terms of growth and innovation. Of course, this phase of the economic cycle is not helping us, as Mr Yiannitsis said, nor is the current international political situation. On top of the endogenous causes of Europe's economic slowdown are the uncertainties and fears associated with the risk of a conflict and the difficulty of ascertaining the timeframes and consequences. This continues to have a considerable impact on the overall strategies and individual decisions of enterprises and investors. There is a prevailing sense of insecurity. Clearly, this situation will continue until we are in a new phase that offers brighter prospects, which is vital for new business and investment strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues we are discussing today are of the utmost importance for Europe's future and for the type of Union we want to leave future generations, but the Iraq crisis is, of course, uppermost in our minds. I am still convinced that war is not inevitable and I continue to hope it can be avoided</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">by applying strict, stringent controls to the Iraqi dictatorship and, at the same time, maintaining and strengthening the international alliance against terrorism. At this time, we must all strive to find common ground so Europe's diplomats can take action. No one can predict the consequences of a conflict. Military intervention, even under the United Nations – the only legitimate framework for any action to counter threats to world peace and security – must remain a last resort, to be used only after all other options have been found to be impracticable. If war breaks out, it must mean that all political options have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis highlights the contradiction between the need for joint action from Europe, which is the basis for the work of the Convention, and the total lack of a European common policy. This is a problem which affects us all directly. Yet if Europe fails to pull together, all the individual States will disappear from the world scene. Unless Europe speaks with a single voice, it will be impossible to continue working closely with the United States on an ongoing basis while retaining our dignity. And unless Europe and the United States work together, it will be impossible to preserve world peace and stability. It is the behaviour people see in times of crisis that they remember and take as a model, an example for the future. At such times, trust is won or lost.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake is our determination to make Europe an influential leading player on the world stage with its own values and traditions, its interests and its vision of the world. Today, both the old and the new Member States need to show and apply that determination, committing themselves to the common cause in the knowledge that they are helping to create a political player that will keep faith with its allies and be mindful of its responsibilities and role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current international context, which is by no means favourable to economic recovery, we need to show greater political will and coherence if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives and fulfil the pledges we gave at EU summits in practical terms. Indeed, I am convinced that the Lisbon Strategy is the best way, even in the current circumstances, to bring our citizens greater prosperity and greater social cohesion. It is also the only strategy that can bring a strong recovery and ensure these benefits are sustainable for future generations. It is my – and the Commission's – fundamental task to continue, steadfastly and tenaciously, to give more impetus to the implementation of our strategy. I wrote to the Heads of State and Government to this effect about three months ago, drawing attention to certain points I consider necessary for the success of the forthcoming Spring Council. I know I can rely on the Greek Presidency's backing in this, as was clear from what you said just now, Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">The gap between political objectives and legislation I referred to a year ago has now been narrowed to a certain extent, but only to a certain extent. Progress has been made in energy, financial services, the Single Sky and research. Nevertheless, more political determination is needed to get things moving on the Community patent, which has now become a symbol of the Union's ability – or inability – to achieve its goals. We must also achieve satisfactory agreements on the Directives on take-over bids, the prospectus and pension funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we need to review the European Employment Strategy. In this regard, the Commission welcomes the proposal put forward by a number of countries for a task force of high-level experts to assist it in its work. At the initiative of Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whom I would like to thank heartily for taking this on, the task force will be set up as soon as possible. Above all, however, we must bridge the gap between Community legislation adopted and its implementation at national level. The number of decisions adopted but not yet transposed into national law is still too large – and, quite frankly, it is actually increasing – in the field of reforms connected with the Single Market, employment and social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in view of these considerations, my message to you today, the message which, in the light of today's debate, I intend to deliver to the Spring Council, is this: Europe can still succeed. Europe can meet the challenge of modernisation and innovation and it can show that the European economic and social model is a model example for the world. Those objectives, however, cannot be met without far-reaching changes in our societies. Far-reaching changes that call for political decisions, a shared outlook and rules. Let us not delude ourselves that market mechanisms or the pride of researchers and scientists suffice to meet the challenge of modernisation: what are needed are decisions we agree on and a common will.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year's Spring Council is also a time to look at the economic strategy, what we call the governance of Economic and Monetary Union. Our fellow citizens need to understand the nature of our project and how our monitoring and decision-making system functions, how it uses all the instruments available to us today, in particular the Broad Guidelines for Economic Policies, the Employment Strategy and the Internal Market Strategy. We need to explain that these instruments, together with the Stability and Growth Pact, form a coherent and effective whole. This is the aim of our recent proposals for a new interpretation of the criteria for applying the Stability Pact. This interpretation pays more attention to the different economic situation of each country and the need to finance the reforms planned under the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I feel it is important today to stress our action in the field of education, research and innovation as well. This calls for governments to reform their regulatory and tax frameworks to eliminate the obstacles to establishing and developing enterprises. The Commission will do its part: to this end, we have just adopted an action plan to simplify and update the Community acquis, making it clearer and more precise.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging changes in the way research is organised and opening it up is the basic aim of the European Research Area. Exploiting the advantages that a shared vision – a genuine common research culture – can bring in universities and enterprises is vital to this end. Over and above the economic aspects, we must not, indeed, neglect the social impact, particularly in terms of jobs created, participation and cohesion, that a coherent education and research strategy can yield.</p>
<p class="contents">Our national education systems may differ widely but they are all faced with clear challenges, and these can only be met if we tackle them together. Thus, the work programme on the matter up to 2010 needs to be implemented quickly and coherently to make our education systems more effective and more coordinated. That means we must invest better and invest more in research and education. In this regard, we cannot put off establishing major scientific centres of excellence at European level any longer if we want to make Europe an absolute world leader in research. This is a line we have been exploring for many months and I believe that it is now time to proceed with it and place it on the table, for if we cannot attract the best brains on the planet we will certainly not be able to put the Lisbon Strategy into effect. According to the Lisbon Strategy, we have to be world leaders. In order to be world leaders, we have to have the best brains in the world. We will only be able to attract the best brains in the world if we have major research centres which are the best in the world. It is a simple, ambitious strategy, which the Commission is going to propose not least because I believe that, without it, we will have no chance of achieving the goals we ourselves have set.</p>
<p class="contents">If we genuinely, seriously want to lay the foundations for a knowledge-based society, we must, lastly, and this is my last point, take the target literally from now on and invest 3% of GDP in research. This too is a goal we ourselves set. If, however, we look at the budgets of the various Member States, we see that, this year, there has been a shift away rather than towards the figure of 3%. Therefore, either we change the goals or we must endeavour to pursue them consistently. This is the goal and there is no getting away from it: we said 3%, and 3% means 3%. There is no leeway.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is not just a matter of spending more but of spending better, as regards both research and education. I would point out that we cannot afford to let one young person out of five abandon their studies without obtaining a qualification. These are human resources which are a drain on our society. This means we must rethink the way we prepare our young people for the labour market and the world of industry, which are growing tougher by the day. Unless we take these practical steps, we will not be able to make up for the lost time we regret. Building a knowledge-based society is the only way to become a world leader.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we have of course listened with enormous interest to the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, and, if I may summarise, it was concerned with two issues. Firstly, how to restore confidence in the Lisbon strategy and how to improve the efficiency of its implementation. Mr President, that is at the very heart of the matter. I also think that now is a good time to make this analysis, because the realisation of the Lisbon objectives is under very great strain. In addition, the circumstances have become much more difficult, the economic climate is unfavourable, uncertainties have increased and, as the President of the Commission rightly says, entrepreneurship is extraordinarily difficult at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore welcomes the evaluation report from the Commission. The report offers insight into the achievements of the Member States over the last couple of years with regard to implementing the Lisbon objectives. I must say, however, that the picture is disconcerting. We see extraordinarily sluggish implementation by the Member States and vast disparities in implementation. That also means that the credibility of the Council with regard to the implementation of Lisbon has taken a tremendous blow. You were not wrong when you said that it is necessary to restore confidence. Confidence can only be restored, however, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if we put an end to the fine words and magnificent plans and actually concentrate on implementation. Therein lies the main problem. And so we say in our resolution: it is time for the Council and the Commission to come up with a roadmap: a roadmap setting out precisely what tangible aims have to be achieved over which period of time; stating that the Council imposes an obligation to make an effort to actually <span class="italic">do</span> that, that EU legislation will be implemented and that this is then very carefully maintained, and that there is a coherent, consistent division of tasks between the European Council and the relevant national ministers, because that is generally lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon document raises a large number of issues, some of which do, but most of which do not, fall within the jurisdiction of the European Union, and for these we have the fine term ‘open coordination’. It would be good, however, if we could have much more clear-cut agreement on how to proceed with this open coordination. As my group sees it, the emphasis would have to be placed on cooperation, on the exchange of best practices, on benchmarking, and also on respecting the role of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament. Lisbon is not a one-man show involving only the European Council, particularly if one were to now lay its achievements on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the economic and budgetary reform process indicated by the Ecofin Council must be continued. We must then have the courage to take daring decisions. Then we must also get the debate on the revision of the pension system under way. We would call for the three-pillar system to be looked at, under which, of course, the solidarity of the state is maintained, along with the solidarity on the part of trade and industry, and of course individual responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">A three-pillar system may, in future, put us in a better position to tackle the problem of an ageing population. It is true that a large number of obstacles would then have to be removed. If we argue in favour of more entrepreneurship, we make it possible to achieve that aim of a 25% reduction. Let us then get down to enacting the European Charter for SMEs, too. Let us also ensure that something is done about the obstacles to the recognition of educational qualifications. If we say 3% R&amp;D, where is the timetable enabling us to ensure that that 3% can be achieved by 2010? It is lacking, so it must be put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been discussing patents for such a long time now. The intellectual elite, says the President of the Commission, must not leave. Indeed so, but how long will it be before a European patent finally appears? The credibility of the Council rests on this, and at some stage we must take up a position on it. It should not be the case that it is constantly being blocked by a number of the national ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the knowledge-based economy is key. However, we no longer have any inkling that a significant part of software development, and all the research in the field of the knowledge-based economy, is currently on its way over to Japan because we in Europe have been consistently unable to establish the 3G sector. We are already three years behind Japan and, by the time we do bring it in, we will be five years behind. That is disastrous in a sector like this. I am therefore making an urgent plea to the Council: do not go on discussing the French proposal to give another six or nine billion back to one operator, but instead give some thought to devising a programme that will enable you to actually make 3G a reality in Europe. We need it.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, what is important is not fine words, but deeds, and sending out a strong signal that the Council must actually get down to the business of implementation. What is important is getting a roadmap, so that we can see, in practical terms, who is going to do what and when. What is important is having a good working relationship between the different parts of the Council, and between the European Council and the relevant national ministers, because otherwise we will keep muddling along, and then the intellectual elite really will go to the United States and Europe will remain on the sidelines. Our Europe does not deserve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro was one of those ambitions, which is providing increasing benefits for citizens. After thirteen months in actual physical existence, the euro has become the equal of the dollar, and is already the second reserve currency in the world. Since the European Central Bank has been managing monetary policy, the rate of inflation in the euro zone has remained lower than the American and British rates of inflation. Long term interest rates are at an historic low in Europe and lower than in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">By pointing out these facts, I am standing against the prevailing euro-scepticism and against the tendency for self-punishment among many of our colleagues. It is true that Europe has problems: growth has slowed down, some large Member States have mounting deficits and unemployment is rising again. However, which region in the world does not have problems? We are told that Europe is suffering as a result of its lack of flexibility and structural deficiencies due to social overprotection. We are given the example of an American economy which is reportedly more productive and which, thanks to a more flexible labour market, is said to create more jobs. So what do we see? American unemployment is higher than in the vast majority of European Member States. What is more, the American unemployment rate does not count the two million Americans of working age who are in prison. However there is something more important: productivity per hour is greater in Europe than in the United States, which is evidence of greater efficiency of production and services in Europe. This efficiency is reflected in international trade, in which the Union is selling nearly twice the volume of American exports. The United States are accumulating other deficits. Currently, if the federal budget deficit were evaluated according to the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, it would be between 5% and 6% of the United States GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason that I am pointing out these figures is not in order to gloat about them, as the United States are an essential driving force in the world economy. Europe could take over, as long as it equips itself with the resources to support its ambitions. The Lisbon Strategy is an ambition that will incite action, but the Member States will have to finally get behind implementing this joint strategy defined in Lisbon and Gothenburg. The Commission should ensure that all the Member States keep to this strategy as a whole, and not only to a few structural reforms, which are necessary but not sufficient to create the most competitive knowledge and ‘well-being’ based society in the world. In this context, Europe needs to rethink its investment strategy. In 1970, Europe used 4.2% of its GDP for public investments. Now we have dropped that figure to 2.3%.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that stability is essential for fighting inflation and public deficits. It also helps towards defending the purchasing power of the poorest in our societies. However, in order to have greater growth, we need to invest in infrastructures, research and the knowledge-based society. We also need to distinguish between investment expenditure and operation expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will conclude by saying that I have tried to give an optimistic message. However, if war were necessary, we would all have to take another look. One of the first victims of this war will certainly be the Stability and Growth Pact, unless Europe refuses to sacrifice growth and employment on the altar of the gods of war. We therefore need to work to prevent this war in order to preserve growth and employment.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I congratulate the President-in-Office on his speech and wish him well with his agenda. Mr Prodi has outlined the scale of the challenges we face and the measures that are needed; yet it seems to me that if the Union's backbone were as strong as its wishbone this debate might not be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of unresolved economic reform issues on the agenda for the Spring Council makes depressingly familiar reading. A year ago, ahead of the Barcelona European Council, which one government dubbed the 'make or break summit' for economic reform, the Union was deadlocked over fundamental issues such as the Community Patent, the Take-over Bids Directive and the Pensions Directive. Ministers were at sixes and sevens over the Stability Pact, having failed to issue early warnings to Germany and Portugal. Resolving these issues was proclaimed to be the foremost objective of the heads of state and government.</p>
<p class="contents">So how much progress have we made, one year on? On the Community Patent, which Mr Prodi mentioned - no progress. The best gloss that you can put on the new Take-over Bids Directive is that it is 'a work in progress'. Far from improving the situation, the Pensions Directive could actually represent a step backwards if adopted in the form currently advocated by Parliament's rapporteur. And Germany and Portugal have since been joined by France in the rogues' gallery of countries which are falling foul of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">In the midst of this litany of failure, in step Messrs Blair, Chirac and Schröder with another depressing example of letterbox diplomacy. After highlighting Europe's divisions on Iraq with the 'gang of 8' letter, the UK's Prime Minister has now formed a terrible trio of leaders with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder, who presume to tell other leaders how to reform their economies while blocking economic progress themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">To hear a clarion call for economic reform from a British Prime Minister whose continued indecision over joining the euro is hitting jobs, growth and investment, is more than a little galling.</p>
<p class="contents">For the President of France to put his name to a letter calling for the rapid completion of the internal market, when France tops the charts for failure to implement single market legislation, is little short of breathtaking.</p>
<p class="contents">And to be lectured on the need for Europe to reform labour markets and increase employment by a Chancellor who has presided over record levels of unemployment in Germany, really takes the biscuit.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps a little humility from those three leaders is called for when it comes to economic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the third year of the ten-year Lisbon plan to improve competitiveness. The truth is that progress has been disappointing. The keys to higher employment levels and sustainable growth lie in sound public finances, a dynamic private sector, the completion of the single market, a real European research area and incentives for work, skill and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would emphasise in particular the importance of completing the financial services action plan, fostering entrepreneurship and promoting flexibility and adaptability in the labour market. We must also increase the participation of women, immigrants, older workers and disabled people in the labour market, and adapt tax and benefit systems to make work pay.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the challenges we face and we have only seven years left it we are to achieve our goal of making Europe the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world. Instead of setting new bold targets, the heads of state and government should get on with the job of closing the existing 'delivery gap' between their words and their actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The slowdown in economic growth, the relocation and closure of companies accompanied by further redundancies, higher employment and increased social difficulties demonstrate the danger of the approach that has been pursued. This approach involves speeding up liberalisation and privatisation, the insistence on the primacy of monetary policies and of competition, the deregulation of the labour market and of labour legislation and making these more flexible. These factors clearly demonstrate the need for a sea-change in the neo-liberal guidelines and policies currently practised, which will not happen as a result of the proposals that have been presented to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission acknowledges, however, that the lack of up-to-date data still hampers the detailed study of what is happening in the field of poverty and social exclusion. Furthermore, little progress has been made in preventing early school leaving and in reducing gender inequality and the guidelines that have been presented, specifically in the field of social security, structural reforms of the labour market of work based on making work more flexible and more precarious and on wage moderation, and for pursuing the process of liberalisation in an increasing number of sectors, tend to aggravate the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">By accentuating the unilateral approach to the liberalisation and greater flexibility of the goods, services, capital and labour force markets, ignoring economic and social cohesion, the Commission and the Council are contributing to increasingly significant social problems and to hampering economic recovery. Consequently, as we highlighted in the resolution tabled by my group, it is crucial that the objectives of full employment, the harmonisation of social conditions in order to achieve progress, economic and social cohesion and development are defined as priorities for the Spring Summit. Social and employment policies cannot remain subordinated to strict compliance with the criteria of nominal convergence and make it urgent to redefine the mandate and powers of the European Central Bank. Sustainable development with a view to achieving social and ecological conversion must be founded on a thorough overhaul of the irrational criteria of the stability pact, given the diversity of the economic and social situation of the various countries. It also requires a more equitable distribution of wealth, an overhaul of social protection systems in a way that demonstrates solidarity, and requires public and social investment, particularly in education, research and in the knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as demanded by workers and citizens almost everywhere, including in Portugal last weekend, for example, at the impressive demonstration in Lisbon, it is time to heed the calls of the citizens and the workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I have barely heard mention of those last two words. The question, therefore, is whether Lisbon is on the right track that is the question in the Commission notice and whether we, the EU, are still on the right track, and are travelling at the right speed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the right track is concerned, I think that the report is based on a number of presuppositions – in regard to which I should like to delve a little deeper than Mr van Velzen and a number of analyses that are incorrect. I think that what we are dealing with is not a new economy but a cyclical one, and we have to take account of this. I think that we are also over-emphasising the knowledge-based economy, as we also need jobs at the bottom of the labour market – but I do not hear anyone talking about this. We are overestimating the potential of liberalisation and underestimating the Member States’ capacity to implement directives and legislation. We are not seeking the causes of the failure to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the EU still on the right track, and travelling at the right speed? I think that Mr van Velzen puts it well, and several people have mentioned it. The answer is no. Let us look at employment: there are too few new jobs. With our twelve million, we can consider ourselves well off, but these jobs are not the result of our policies alone. The number of women, older people and people with disabilities in employment is too low. The path to better jobs is still long, and we have done far too little in the way of the modernisation of the organisation of work. I hope, therefore, that the review of the employment strategy that we are now going to work on and the improvement of the social agenda will bring about an adjustment in that field.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the environment, we see that nothing has come of the horizontal integration in this policy. I am saying it simply but in the strongest terms. I have also just said that little progress has been made in the transport sector, and likewise in energy policy, in agricultural policy and in the field of public health. Who is discussing energy tax reforms? And so on, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the general approach, too, talking of Kyoto or Johannesburg, we see very little progress. However, we need better indicators, et cetera. I have already said it: the policy is too one-sided with regard to knowledge and innovation. As an engineer, I am all for the intellectual elite, but we should also look at other developments. We need other jobs, too, and that means that we also have to think of the bottom end of the labour market, that we have to tackle the informal economy, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The streamlining of economic and social policy is very important, but that means that we have to draw conclusions both for the Stability and Growth Pact and for the orientation of the broad economic guidelines towards social and environmental policy. We must continue with Lisbon, but incorporating great adjustments, not only in the Member States, who have all kinds of things to implement, but also strategic adjustments and adjustments to its content. In my opinion, we need a thorough evaluation of what we are doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, I welcome the positive and pragmatic contributions made this morning by the Greek Presidency and by the Commission President, Mr Prodi. I welcome the fact that every spring EU leaders meet to review what is known as the Lisbon Process, which is designed to ensure that the European Union becomes the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world. Over the coming weeks, there will be many ministerial meetings to put in place serious preparatory work before EU leaders meet on 21 March 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a lot of work to do, as recent data presently points towards slow economic development within the Union. Growth rates for the last quarter of 2002 range between 0.1% and 0.4% of GDP growth within the European Union. Unemployment within the Union stands at 8.5%. I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency is focusing on the need to create more and better jobs within the European Union. It is clear that the spring European Council meeting will put labour market reforms at the top of its agenda. We must all be conscious of the need to improve the workings of the European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government is right to guarantee that the social partners in Europe will be involved intrinsically in the process of labour market reform. I have always supported social partnership, which is based on the sensible principle of involving trade union and employer groups in key economic and social reform policy issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency is working towards the implementation of the Green Paper on entrepreneurship. This will focus on eliminating red tape which hampers the day-to-day activities of the 19 million small and medium-sized companies in Europe. It will also entail enactment of the European Charter for small enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve access for small companies to know-how and to finance, and we must simplify our regulatory environment. If the European Union is to become the leading knowledge-based economy in the world, then we must take full advantage of all new information technologies. We must guarantee universal access to new telecom services for all the citizens of the Union and we must put in place adequate training and educational programmes for all users.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the EU initiative and the adoption of a Community-wide patent system are certainly concrete measures that must be supported. The Greek Government is rightly pushing all the Member States to put in place innovative structures which will fully guarantee the payment of future pension policies. Fortunately, as a society, we are living longer and that is why our governments must plan for the demographic changes for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have sent a complaint to President Giscard d'Estaing and asked to be given the right of access to the documents being used in the course of the Praesidium’s work. We have still not received a reply.</p>
<p class="contents">President Giscard d'Estaing has refused another request to scrutinise documentation on the grounds that EU rules on transparency do not apply to him. I should like to call upon the Presidency to inform him politely but firmly that the Praesidium too is funded by EU taxpayers and must of course act in accordance with the judgments of the Court of Justice and the principle of transparency, which now appears in Article 255 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no exemption for President Giscard d'Estaing and no legal base for representatives of the Commission, Parliament and the Council being able to depart from the principle of transparency unless they are provided with a special legal base by the regulation on transparency or decline to make a document available after making a practical assessment of it. In the case of every single document in the Praesidium’s possession, President Giscard d'Estaing must weigh up its significance in the negotiations against the public’s interest in knowing about it and, like everyone else in the EU, he must ensure that the principle of equality is practised.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation must not arise in which three political groups have documents from the Praesidium available to them that are not available to the other four groups, or in which Convention documents circulate among foreign ministry interns that have not also been made available to members of the Convention. We demand equality – neither more, nor less.</p>
<p class="contents">The word ‘constitution’ appears 32 times in the first 16 articles. It must now be clear even to those least quick on the uptake that a constitution, and not merely a constitutional treaty, is being worked on.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to call for the Praesidium to be reconstituted and made more representative of EU citizens. All the political groups should be represented. Women, who constitute half the electorate, cannot be satisfied with two places; the 13 candidate countries cannot be satisfied with one observer; and there cannot continue to be no representatives of that half of the electorate who voted no in the referendums on the EU held in the few countries that allow people to vote.

The final Lisbon Objective – to make the European economy the most competitive knowledge-based economy in ten years – appeared to many, right from the start, to be an optimistic, consolatory slogan. In actual fact, it seems increasingly less consolatory seeing as, three years later, very little headway has been made towards attaining that objective. The European economy is still at the starting-post, the necessary reforms are postponed or watered-down at each summit and the hopes of unemployed Europeans of finding work thanks to growth are still closely associated with the revival of the economy of that driving force: the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Spring Summit, the Heads of State and Government will probably confirm their commitment to the Lisbon Objectives, even though as things stand, we cannot be sure of this. A letter addressed to the Greek Presidency is already doing the rounds, reaffirming the need and desire to revitalise the European economy through ambitious structural reforms. Good – very good, we will say – but we Radicals nevertheless believe that instead of setting or reintroducing impressive objectives, we should do useful and fair things right now: welfare systems are in urgent need of immediate reform, and for many States constitute, in addition to a serious injustice for future generations, a real time bomb for the sustainability of public finances; we need to liberalise the markets in key sectors such as energy, transport, postal services and the professions; we need to create a truly integrated European financial market; there must be drastic cuts in the burdens weighing down, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses in Europe – tax burdens and bureaucratic burdens in terms of employment regulations – and which are one of the reasons for which a substantial number of European entrepreneurs and microentrepreneurs – I am referring mainly, but not exclusively, to Italy – are driven into the underground economy, a type of economy which evades regulation, which evades legality precisely because of the excessive burdens which are imposed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what should be done, if we want to avoid fooling ourselves with slogans, with magic formulae – formulae put to much use in this Chamber – such as ‘European social model’ or ‘social market economy’. We would do well to ask ourselves whether these models are, today, really capable of protecting society’s most vulnerable, society’s ‘outsiders’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lisbon is certainly very much about competitiveness. It is very much about jobs. Jobs will create greater prosperity and, therefore, in turn more social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday I clashed briefly with Commissioner Diamantopoulou at Question Time on the atypical workers directive. I do not wish to revisit the various points made there, except to say that I would like to clear up a misunderstanding which is relevant to this debate. I mentioned that Birmingham City Council – a socialist-run council, one of the largest employers of temporary workers in the UK – has decided to reduce in number the thousands of temporary workers it employs. And I mean 'decided to reduce' already, as a direct result of the proposed atypical workers directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestion from the Commissioner, possibly because of the interpretation, was that this was to do with the costs of insurance. It was directly linked to the costs of extra pay for the temporary workers and, moreover, the costs of the extra red tape involved in employing temporary workers. As a result of that, thousands of workers will lose their jobs. If that happens just in one council, it can happen throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking the presidency to ensure that the whole Commission accepts the importance of competitiveness in generating jobs, and the need therefore to promote competitiveness and not labour market inflexibility based on out-of-date dogma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish the current Presidency-in-Office well at the extraordinary summit next Monday. I hope that it can establish a common position for the European Union in the present very fraught situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to put it to the Commission and the Council that one of the most important things we can do at the summit is insist that Member States comply with the agreements they make in the Council. By this I mean both the targets they agree to under the Lisbon Process and the implementation of those targets because there is a clear gap in the implementation process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to re-emphasise a point made by a number of Members. The Lisbon Process is not simply a liberalisation process – important as that is. The whole idea of the Lisbon Process was to have a coordinated and well-balanced social and economic approach to modernising the European social model. If we are to retain the uniqueness of the European Union, then we must ensure that social equity is not sacrificed in pursuit of the goal of liberalisation and competitiveness. That is also essential – not just from the point of view of social justice but also for creating a more productive Union. We have to ensure that those who are engaged in production feel it is worthwhile for them and for their children.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the crucial role of public services has to be defended. At the summit, the Commission and the Council have to seek to guarantee that services of general interest are enabled to grow and develop and are protected – and I use that word cautiously – from the ravages of the free market.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that we must set targets for youth employment, in particular for disadvantaged youth. They are the long-term unemployed of tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increase in the implementation deficit is causing EU markets to splinter and is eroding the benefits of the Internal Market. Unless the directives on telecommunications, for example, are implemented in the Member States, that sector’s development will be become more disharmonious than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain our competitiveness it is vital that we increase resources for research and training. We will not succeed in the future with just bulk products and a poorly trained workforce. Tax on earnings and employers’ indirect costs must be cut to boost employment in Europe and to make it easier for SMEs and growth companies in particular to employ staff. Lower taxation would, for its own part, stimulate European entrepreneurship, one of the pillars of competitiveness. Let taxation in future fall within the competence of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also encourage Member States to lighten the tax burden in parallel with the Lisbon objectives so that they take account of fair and positive tax competition. The EU’s task in this area will be to compile comparable data and propagate best practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I would like to concentrate on employment and on the objective of full employment which I think should be the prime, if not sole objective of the European Union, as all other objectives are only consequences of it. This applies to equality between men and women, the progress of social harmonisation, maintaining and developing public services, establishing sustainable development, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Full employment requires that the Stability and Growth Pact be reviewed, made more flexible and improved, that social partners be respected and listened to, that companies that make redundancies solely in order to make a profit be penalised, in particular when they have had public subsidies, that the European Council makes a major commitment and the research efforts be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, whatever some people think, the old liberal recipes have failed. Not enough jobs are being created, the Lisbon objectives have not been achieved and enlargement could aggravate the situation for the Fifteen and also for the ten new Member States that are soon going to join us.

It is very ironic, however, to state that the European Union is going to be the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 and then do absolutely nothing dynamic about living up to this. In so doing, the European Union makes itself look ridiculous and the Council is not meeting its responsibilities. The most important reason is that we, as a Union, tolerate the failure of the Member States to honour the commitments they have entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, it has emerged that France, for example, does not, in general, want to have anything to do with the commitments it entered into in 2000. For example, the monopoly of the largest energy supplier remains in place, and, what is more, <span class="italic">that</span> subsidised energy is being exported to those Member States who have indeed opened up their borders. In so doing, we have achieved the opposite of what we intended. The countries that have carried out liberalisation are being punished for their good behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to see to it that countries honour the commitments they have entered into. This means commitments that are honoured instead of more targets. If we do not want to let the Lisbon process become a gigantic flop, definite action will have to be taken, and the Commission will have to draw up a clear timetable stating how the aims are to be achieved, setting end dates so that the Member States can be called to account on their responsibilities. The emphasis will have to be placed on financial soundness, on full liberalisation of the services sector, the creation of a knowledge-based economy by investment in research and development, and radical simplification of the regulatory environment. This means less detailed legislation and more framework legislation, so that people are not hampered in their activities by unnecessary red tape. It is not just the Lisbon process but the credibility of the whole Union that is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I was struck by the speech by Mr Bouwman on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but I should like to add one thing to it. He says that jobs should be created at the bottom of the market, and not only for the intellectual elite, and I agree with that, but we have to realise that one is a precondition for the other, and for this we need a competitive Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, Birmingham City Council is a Labour council, not a socialist council. More importantly, his comment raises many questions about the current employment practices of councils within the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of the information we have received, for example from the low pay unit, indicates that many of the people working through agencies at the moment are poorly paid, poorly protected and very badly served. We need to look at this clearly. For example, the school where I used to work has now brought back in-house its cleaning staff because it can pay them more and it works out cheaper than employing them through an agency. So there is a win-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">But the question I particularly want to raise with the Council and Commission this morning is linked to the issue of sustainable development, which is an overarching and not just an additional concept, and the place of Göteborg and not just Lisbon within this whole process. Since Johannesburg, private companies have been seen as a means of delivering government policy. There is a need to think again about corporate social responsibility and a strong legal framework for this when examining how companies behave in emerging democracies or countries with repressive regimes, often backed by governments through export credit guarantees. We need to ask them to look at this and assess whether the present 'free for all' really encourages sustainability, democracy and openness in many of the regimes and countries within which they are operating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Prodi said this in anticipation of the debate that we will have this afternoon on the situation in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The geopolitical context of the European Council meeting will not only be present in our minds, but also very evident in the data and economic forecasts from our Member States. A climate of international tension is always damaging to the world economy and is one of the major results expected by the terrorist organisations behind that tension.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council meeting will focus on evaluating the measures that have been implemented in order to achieve the Lisbon objective, which consists of making the European Union the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. In particular it will involve evaluating the efforts made by the Member States and by the European Union in education, training and also research and development. We are all aware that the results so far do not match up to the Lisbon objectives, but how can we be surprised at this when the governments of most of our countries have no other choice than to remedy the negligence and lack of foresight of their socialist predecessors who, far from making the necessary efforts when there was an opportunity for growth, have spread public resources thinly, sprinkling them between state handout programmes with no future?</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels European Council will therefore be a useful opportunity for our countries to reconsider the Lisbon objectives by adapting them to the economic and social reality of our public finances and resituating them in the international context. I would like to conclude by encouraging President Prodi for his initiative in presenting a plan to simplify European legislation, of no less than 90 000 pages. This initiative is more than welcome in order to make life easier for business and therefore to increase the competitiveness of the Union. This plan aims to reduce the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> to some 25 000 pages between now and 2005 and simplify the language in draft legislation. I do not think that anyone will complain about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The message from this summit must be one of confidence, because Europe's economy and hence growth and employment, will not be got moving if such confidence in the EU Member States' political leadership is not created or, where it exists, improved. I do think, however, that it is not just confidence in governments that matters, but that it is also significant that European business is at last affirming its responsibility for contributing towards growth, investment, and employment. The state alone cannot create the jobs that Europe needs in order to really develop its productivity and also in order to become the region of the world best able to face the future. So it is to the Greek Presidency of the Council that I am appealing for a continued campaign against unfair fiscal competition and for us to be enabled at last to blockade all the tax havens and not let matters rest with the first breakthrough we achieve on the fiscal package, so that everyone can help put the Member States in a better position as regards the receipts on which their ability to make investments depends.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that I would like, again, to appeal to the private business sector to step up private investment. Not only is there too little public investment, but the private sector also invests too little, and it is only partnership between the two that will enable Europe to evade the self-fulfilling prophecy that our weak growth – or, in certain states, stagflation – will be followed by recession, which is something Europe can do without. It is because our periods of growth are far too weak that this appeal is addressed to the Greek Presidency of the Council, along with the appeal to the Commission and the Council for improved cooperation between the institutions. The European Parliament, as co-legislator, is prompt in doing its work, and it would be a good thing if the Council could keep up with us.</p>

It would make a great change – and I say this to him with due humility - if Presidents of the Economic Council would come here with a shortlist of things they were actually going to deliver. One hundred priorities on a list means there are no priorities at all! I want to echo what Mrs Randzio-Plath just said. It would be refreshing – in fact essential – for the Economic Summit, when it meets on 21 March, to set down what its real priorities are. I would suggest - and I think all colleagues would agree with this – your priorities are to inject confidence and dynamism and a sense that the Prime Ministers of the European Union are determined to create a dynamic single market in which we will create jobs and accelerate economic growth. If we do not get investors behind that, President-in-Office, how are we to deliver all the other promises on your long list? That is what we must do.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be refreshing – and, as you said, innovative – to find ways to activate the European Charter for small enterprises. It would not take much innovation to talk about it for once and actually implement it. It has taken three years of inaction to demonstrate that making business start-ups easier and cheaper across the Union – something the Prime Minister is committed to doing – simply has not happened. Again, I echo what Members have said: it is about time the Member State governments started to deliver on their promises on the patent, completing the internal market, clearing their transposition deficit and moving forward on the internal market for services.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, we are witnessing an absurd situation where a simple mutual recognition measure of sales promotion is blocked in your Council. Show us the message, take away the clutter, get down to business and priorities, come back here and then we will feel you have delivered something.

It is therefore clear that our proposals look like pious hopes or we appear to be reaffirming our will while we know that we do not have the tools to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, underlying our debates and the Spring Summit that is being prepared, there is a fundamental challenge involving reforming the Treaties with a view to the new Constitution for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that if we want to arrive at a structured concept by determining how these three elements can form a sound cycle of development in Europe, we would be well advised to look more closely at what is happening in the services of general interest sector. If there is a triangle, services of general interest are the barycentre of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us think about that and look at how our European policies are operating today.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, we will not achieve any results by trying, on the one hand, to speed up the construction of the internal market, with all that it involves in terms of opening up to competition and, ultimately, privatisation, and by seeking, on the other hand, to maintain the balance by arguing that it will be done in the interests of the public, of social cohesion, etc. We have a duty to evaluate what has been done, and that will help us to think about how economic activity, which is supposed to fulfil fundamental rights and ensure social and territorial cohesion, can or should be considered and integrated into the new Treaties. Where is the evaluation? Where is the framework directive for services of general interest? Where are our proposals to strengthen Article 16 of the Treaty, particularly regarding the resources and tasks of these services of general interest?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that if we are capable of moving forward in our discussion, without being dogmatic, looking at what is happening and what it would be appropriate to do, our ideas will begin to take shape. You know, brains are indeed precious, but what counts above all is collective intelligence, and that is what we especially have among users, employees and operators, just like among elected representatives who are reminded every day of the cost of the closure of public services in their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I think that this is a very important indicator that we need to use and take advantage of for the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite some timid progress, the basic idea of integrating economic, social and environmental policies has not seen any significant, coherent progress at either Member State or Community level. If we totally accept the view that social and environmental quality is not incidental, but an element of growth and an essential factor of competitiveness, then I believe that the open cooperation method must be strengthened. I therefore applaud the fact that, in the Convention, the possibility of granting it constitutional status seems to be gaining support.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience teaches us that objectives as ambitious as those involved in the concept of sustainable development cannot be attained without a strong, common lead from all social and institutional quarters. Regarding environmental policies in particular, without the adoption of plans and incentives at all levels, it is hard to imagine that more eco-compatible production and consumption models will really take off, models to which we are also committed under the Johannesburg Summit conclusions. We therefore need to ensure that all interested parties are persuaded to adopt innovative and responsible practices, by including them in medium and long-term outlooks.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I consider it a grave limitation that Parliament has not yet managed to formulate organisational and procedural methods in order to monitor, appraise and guide sustainable development policies in a truly effective – that is, multidisciplinary – way. It is right to call for Parliament’s effective participation in the formulation of the broad guidelines to be guaranteed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, but we too must make better preparations to achieve our goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that there are two reasons for this. The first is to do with Lisbon itself. Back then, we took – as we, particularly, do now – as our starting point scenarios based on excessively high growth rates. I think that too many people think that growth is something that you can simply write in a book and it just happens. It does not. Instead, as Mr van Velzen pointed out, you then have to take hundreds of measures to promote this growth, and that cannot be done by means of rhetoric alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, of course, all kinds of promises were made, and they have not been kept. This has also been pointed out enough times. What, however, can we do about it now? One of the things you spoke about, Mr Prodi, was the takeover bids directive. That is one example that I would like to give. There is a great deal of talk about employment effects. In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have been looking into the probable employment effects of this takeover bids directive. They are negative. The Commission itself did not look into that. I would also like to see some more employment impact assessment, therefore, not only in the field of social measures – which is logical – but also with regard to other measures, in particular financial measures. Things often do not turn out as one would think.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I would draw attention to is the figures. In the Commission’s answer to a question I asked, it admitted that the European growth figures cannot be compared favourably with those for the United States, presumably because the US growth figures should always be taken with a pinch of salt. It makes sense to me that we not only look at the US or China, but that we at all events use good figures and not go by incorrect data.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a good deal has been said about cooperation in the field of universities. I think that that is very important. I think that a lot more can be done without us encroaching on the sovereignty of the Member States in this respect. I should like to put one question to the Presidency, however. How is it possible, if we are busy working on the universities, that, in Greece, the state universities still enjoy a monopoly, so that thousands of Greek students are studying in the USA and not in other European countries? Can an end not be put to this? I know that this is a Greek responsibility, but perhaps some thought could be given to it during your Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The desire to end support and to promote the free market is certainly positive, but how can we pursue this objective gradually, taking into account on the one hand, the needs of developing countries, and on the other, the needs of Mediterranean countries which would surely suffer severe, inestimable damage, owing to sudden and excessive liberalisation and the withdrawal of support? This is a subject which I think the Presidency of a Mediterranean country should address, and should be of particular importance to it, not least because 2010 is not far off and the free market area is an appointment we cannot miss, but one for which we are making inadequate preparations. We should initiate a major debate and large awareness campaign throughout the Union on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">A final remark on the European research area, which greatly concerns me: our economy is indissolubly linked to our ability to intensify research, but many small-sized, very small businesses remain outside the Sixth Framework Programme, not because the Programme itself requires it, but because they cannot manage to take advantage of this opportunity by themselves. I would call for an incentive to be considered for small-sized business combinations, especially in circumstances where there is little inclination to plan and make arrangements together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate him for raising the problem of war with Iraq, which is clouding the atmosphere and will have a direct impact on the political and economic future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We started out with great expectations of the Lisbon process. However, in education, research, lifelong learning and training, it does not appear to be delivering the goods. 3% in research was an important target and the Commission deserves our praise for managing to push it through, but we come at it as if our hands were tied behind our back and we fail to make the necessary progress every year. We talk a great deal about training, but the private sector only invests 2.3% in training and progress with investments in lifelong learning, school-leavers and immigrant groups does not, unfortunately, give us cause for optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is taking place in a climate which discourages university researchers and teachers because decisions are not followed up with the practical policies needed. Education and training are not, unfortunately, at the top of the agenda, not even the Lisbon agenda. But we still believe they must remain at the heart of the policies, as they were formulated when the Lisbon process was first designed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Spring Summit must therefore pay just as much attention to these, and not spend hours on the economy, minutes on social aspects and only seconds on environmental policy. The European Commission should prepare a sustainability report each year, and the joint resolution requests that the European Commission do just that. One example is fuel cell cars: the car of the future. Citizens of the United States and Japan are already driving them: they are already available; but not in Europe. We are lagging behind in this field. The widespread use of fuel cell cars, powered by biomass, will also mean that wars over oil will be a thing of the past. Environment, social aspects and economy are each of equal importance. It is a great shame that by no means all Heads of Government have taken this to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who are able to produce goods whilst producing the least emissions will be the winners in this new economy. They will therefore be able to gain advantages in terms of employment and in economic and environmental terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it is extremely important that the European Union should have developed an emissions-trading system that will enable us to lower emissions in industry and in the energy sector, which accounts for fifty thousand companies and for 46% of carbon dioxide emissions. This is particularly important because it will lower the financial cost to Europe of complying with Kyoto by 35%.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, resolve Kyoto merely through industry and energy. The Commission needs to come up with initiatives for the transport, farming and energy sectors. Despite the fact, however, that we in Europe are living in a carbon economy, we are still dependent on Russia’s agreement for the Kyoto protocol to enter into force. We also know that the United States are currently waging a campaign in Russia against the Kyoto protocol. I would ask the Council and the Commission, what measures are being worked on at European level to ensure that we can convince our Russian friends to ratify the Kyoto protocol? It is crucial that the protocol enters into force so that European businesses can accept the forthcoming measures, some of which are more difficult, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A 3% target for investment in research was set in Barcelona, but it is beginning to look like my New Year's resolution – to eat less and take more exercise – in that it has not been kept and really needs a bit more effort!</p>
<p class="contents">I attended an interesting benchmarking conference in Greece on research and technology. Let me tell you about some of the areas where people looked in detail at the performance of different Member States. Regarding women in science for example, countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy are turning out excellent women scientists and engineers, but other countries are doing very badly. When it comes to persuading young people to enter science and engineering, Nordic countries are doing well, as they do in a lot of categories. Others are doing poorly. This is a crisis across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of linking research with regional policy, again Finland is doing well, and Ireland exceptionally well but other countries are not. Representing Cambridge, I am pleased that some prestigious Cambridge institutions are now looking to South Yorkshire as a suitable location for research infrastructure. Some countries do well in clustering. The more we do of this comparison and the more we learn the lessons of the comparison, the more likely we are to keep our New Year's resolution. I will try harder on mine if Member States try harder on theirs!</p>

If anything, they will make it worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA appears to be determined, with the direct or indirect connivance of the European Union, to go through with its threat of war; against Iraq today, tomorrow against who knows?</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is to redistribute the markets and control energy resources as part of the USA’s master plan to rule the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However hard the communications policy of the European Union and the governments of the Member States tries to nourish vain hopes for the future, the working classes feel the brunt of the system and its anti-worker, anti-grass roots measures on a daily basis. Even the European Union and other international economic organisations admit that their liberal policies have been a total failure. Underlying stagnation and falling production and development can no longer be turned around by stability pacts. It is fast becoming apparent that the much trumpeted social policy of the European Union, as it reduces labour costs and curtails or abolishes the workers’ rights, is not fostering development and is not resolving the crisis inherent in the capitalist system, even on its own terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure to achieve the Lisbon and Stockholm targets on employment proves how right we were when we said that they were designed, not to deal with unemployment, but to step up the attack on workers’ rights and grant big business new privileges. The reason for insisting on privatisation and liberalisation, even in sectors such as health and education, and for handing over insurance funds to big business is so that it can increase its profits even during a recession.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way forward is to galvanise the workers at both national and international level into a bigger, more massive and more dynamic anti-monopoly, anti-imperialist movement and so create a new force field that will get the economy out of the doldrums and pave the way for another, diametrically opposed policy for our people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union is in need of structural reform, as we have heard, and reform of the labour market is a structural reform that will be included in the Spring Summit, preceded by Thessaloniki. However, Mr President, the labour market and welfare systems are two sides of the same coin: if one goes well – the labour market – then so does the other – welfare systems – given that the labour market finances welfare systems and vice versa: if the labour market does not go well, then neither do welfare systems, and Commissioner Solbes starts to have problems. If, on the other hand, the labour market changes – owing to either regulatory reasons or market reasons, or both – then the welfare systems must also change, because they must reflect the changes occurring in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, we also need to launch a strategy for welfare systems, similar to the one we applied, some years back, to the labour market under the Luxembourg Process: national plans, consensus on common objectives, transparency, the so-called three pillars, what was not yet called open coordination but which is now referred to in this way, and so on. We have to synchronise the two systems, we have to synchronise the two reforms, we have to synchronise the labour market and welfare systems. Therefore, open coordination, obligations and evaluation of the Stability Pact are all aspects that must be clearly defined and quantified at the Spring Summit, if we want to meet the Lisbon Objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the decision to place skills and innovation in the frontline of the strategy at the Spring Summit is a welcome one indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication is urging Member States to increase investment in skills and innovation over the next twelve months. This is a good start, but there has to be long-term investment in training. A solid skills base will not be built in a year. Public expenditure for training and education has remained virtually unchanged in all Member States in recent years. With an ageing population and as the need for labour grows we must view training and education, not just as a necessary evil, but as an investment in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Societies which try to make use of the whole nation’s resources, based on a policy of equality, achieve great things. Public services alone are not enough in making use of resources: the public sector must also do its share, especially by offering its employees the opportunity to receive training alongside their work. Training is the most important factor when it comes to employing people. The share of the population that works has increased in the last ten years. Since 1996, for example, 12 million jobs have been created. Most of these have been in sectors that require further or higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and training policy is the responsibility of the Member States, but we can enhance it though cooperation at EU level. The ministers for education have agreed on some common targets for education and training systems. By 2010 the number of those who leave school early should be halved and the proportion of those receiving vocational education and training among 25-64 year olds should be increased to 80%. The imbalance between men and women in the areas of mathematics, technology and science must be corrected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I turn to you for reassurance, in particular President Prodi, not just because he has a persuasive, calm, reassuring, almost paternal voice, but also and above all, because of the statements made so far. Why am I worried? Because many pensioners are worried and cannot sleep either. They know, as I do, that the Presidents-in-Office of the Council try to balance the accounts, for economic reasons, in any way they can, even by cutting expenditure intended for pensioners. Pensioners agree with having accounts that balance – and what well-balanced accounts they are – but some of them only have their pension to live off. The approximate number of people living exclusively off a pension does not exceed one hundred million in Europe, without taking into account the candidate countries, and they say: ‘We are all for balancing the accounts, but why not cut expenditure other than that intended for pensions?’ In some States, for example in Italy, there are laws, adopted by previous governments but still in force under the current government, according to which a 99% disabled person who has worked for a few years is given a pension of EUR 30 a month and widows of young men who have died are given pensions of EUR 18.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we be reassured – and therefore sleep peacefully – that cuts will be made, as is only right, but that this will be done wisely? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think it right that it should be examined critically. At the same time, we must not underestimate the fact that it has done quite a bit of good. If, today, we look at how we are coping with the present recession in comparison with the one we experienced at the beginning of the nineties, there is a big difference. We have low growth, and unemployment has certainly stopped falling, but we are coping much better than we did in the nineties. Might it be that economic coordination and monetary policy are playing a role? That is what I, in any case, believe. At the same time,<span class="italic"> </span>I believe that the Lisbon Process must be reformed. The process needs to be better coordinated. It needs to hang together properly, and more focus on implementation is required. In this connection, it is important for us to see these three parts of the process as being of equal value. It is also important that there should be balance in the Lisbon Process.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Sweden, a country that is used to implementing structural measures. We are in favour of an open economy, competition and structural reforms, but we are also in favour of a high social standard, that is to say social systems that provide security and the target of full employment. If the Lisbon Process does not strike a balance between the structural measures, the employment strategy and sustainable social systems, it will fall apart and fail. It is therefore important that this balance be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to say something about sustainable development. This affects the whole area. It has to do with development that is sustainable economically and with sustainable social systems, especially sustainable pensions systems, that is to say ones that are sustainable both from economic and social points of view, so that they are fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development has to do with the environment too, however. The strategic solution in this connection is investment, for if we get investment under way in the new technology, by which I mean the cleanest technology, we shall also improve the environment throughout Europe, at the same time as increasing growth and creating more jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Gothenburg, however, the Union had taken a big step in that direction by announcing its desire to measure sustainable development through the Spring Council meetings. Having heard your speeches, I am forced to admit that once again, this Spring Council meeting will not achieve that objective. Sustainable development is not part of the European plan, a chapter among others, as it was portrayed. Sustainable development implies a new approach to all our European policies, which would involve social and environmental issues as well as the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is as follows: have you analysed the Union’s policies in the light of these new criteria and, in particular, environmental criteria? We would like to know how environmental and social issues are reflected in your proposals. What are the consequences of an economy that we want to be the most competitive? Even more redundancies? Even more damage to the environment? We are aware today of the financial cost of that social and environmental damage. So please, do not make this Spring Summit just another summit, but an innovative one. The European Union will only get out of the current crisis if it changes its policies as the people expect, and only a socially and environmentally sustainable development plan will be capable of restoring the impetus, optimism and confidence that appear to be severely lacking in both the Council and the Commission. If the Union, our European Union, does not respond to the current challenges, both at international level – I am obviously thinking of the issue of Iraq, on which Europe is unacceptably divided – and at the level of European citizens, who are asking for more Europe, a better Europe, then who will be able to? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most Members add further dimensions. More and more tasks and policy areas are given priority. In the end, almost nothing is given priority and, instead, there is just a long repetition of politically correct words and phrases, while Europe all but stands still.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, there is a need to focus on bringing about the internal market; to put pressure on the Member States to implement EC legislation and remove the obstacles to this; to reduce taxes for companies and make rigid labour markets more flexible; and to have done with large numbers of tasks and rules that are unnecessary for promoting growth. There is a need to focus upon education, research, development, competition and small businesses. At the same time, more stringent monitoring of state subsidies is required, as well as a review of the rules governing regional aid. Confidence in the European business climate is undermined by short-sighted financial aid that is hostile to development, causes distortion and hampers competition. Who will dare, or want, to invest if, by doing so, there is a danger of seeing the whole basis of their enterprise swept away because a similar factory is being set up with EU subsidies in a neighbouring country? These matters must be reviewed, the number of tasks selectively reduced, and action taken. We do not need any more fine-sounding declarations. They are nice to listen to, but it is action that is now required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is indeed regrettable, as – or so I believe –the future development of our society is to a very large degree dependent on how we manage to fashion the elements of our lives in an ecological way that will also be able to enable future generations to live decently. In so far as that is the case, we need to step up our efforts in the area of sustainable development; it is here that I address my remarks particularly to the Council, as we in this House, as well as the Commission, have specified in precise terms what shape sustainable development should take.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, when the Gothenburg Summit was in preparation, laid out before this Parliament very clear indicators and objectives for sustainable development, and these I can wholeheartedly endorse. What I believe hampers our discussion is the Council's failure to take these objectives on board, so that, whilst we are drawing up projected goals for many policy areas, sustainable development is not one of them. This means that it is not possible for us to impose any binding obligations, nor can we monitor what is done. I do not at this point want to draw up a long wish list, as one does at Christmas, but we have to focus our considerations on one or two core elements, and in that respect, strategy for dealing with climate change is certainly one important area, and transport another. What matters is that there should be binding targets, which the Member States have to achieve. I might add that this encourages renewed investment and creates jobs. Let me remind you only of the way in which the promotion of forms of energy such as wind energy has created tens of thousands of jobs in the European Union. What we need, then, is definite goals, goals that we must achieve, rather than only – as Winston Churchill put it – planning great things but taking small steps! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes it a symbol of the unity of Europe, at a time when this unity is being severely tested; perhaps even a symbol of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">This letter is commendably realistic because it puts the emphasis where it is needed: on industry which, apart from the fact that it generates 25% of total European domestic product, also employs 45 million people; at a time when there is a great deal of talk about services, knowledge and so on, it is worth remembering that the economy has a far more material and palpable basis. It also puts the question of public utility services on the right footing. These services are a necessary basis and a necessary infrastructure for the economy and they must be maintained in the European way, not in ways which could lead to their being broken up, as is the case in certain sectors in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the whole issue of modernising the markets and not tying companies down in more red tape. That is quite right. And of course, one issue which is extremely important when it comes to unifying the markets is the unification of the financial markets. From this point of view, 2003 is a milestone in the Lisbon programme. We also need to complete the legislation unifying the transport markets; perhaps the Commission could tell us if it is optimistic about at least keeping to this deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">The prime ministers also emphasise the need for high levels of employment. It is worth remembering that Lisbon talks of full employment, not high levels of employment, and we should stick to our original ambition. Then, of course, there is the question of investments. Where the money is going to come from now that the stock exchanges are falling is a question which needs to be addressed and I hope, Mr President, that the skills of the Greek Government, which has a very distinguished economic staff, will create the optimistic climate without which confidence will crumble and the economy – and hence the Lisbon process – will not progress. This optimism is sorely needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I see the Lisbon strategy as being Europe's response to globalisation. The Lisbon strategy is our regulatory framework, because it links the market to social responsibility and the sustainability of the environment, which is how this regulatory model distinguishes us from the United States and from other continents. What is known as the eco-social market economy is the European regulatory model. We must stop apportioning blame. We must make it clear where responsibilities lie – who is responsible for meeting what target and by when. We need definite targets rather than woolly statements. In which areas do we want to be Number One and by what date? Who has to achieve what subsidiary goal and by when so that the jointly determined European objectives might be fulfilled? What the Spring Summit should do is specify how the Lisbon objectives are to be broken down country by country, and have these objectives incorporated in every statement made by governments and every labour convention entered into by them. There is no contradiction between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strategy; on the contrary, without the Pact, the Lisbon strategy could not be fulfilled. This means that we have to keep on ensuring that the internal market becomes a true internal market and that sufficient account is taken of small and medium-sized businesses' potential as the foundation of Europe's economic structure and a source of new employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It represents an attempt to demonstrate their unity once more and to set the tone for the debate at the summit. There is nothing wrong with this in principle, because I think that it is good that some broad lines are set out amid the multitude of documents that crop up around this kind of summit, but I think that the epistle that these three have drawn up really plunges to new depths. It is an insult to the equilibrium and depth that characterise the Lisbon process, which we have now been working on for three years. In addition, I think that it clumsily upsets the careful balance in the Lisbon objectives, because – and a number of points have already been mentioned in the debate – it leaves out a number of objectives completely, and it only places the emphasis on the interests of trade and industry. It does indeed seem as though the letter has been copied from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Federation of German Industries (BDI) and the French Enterprises Association (MEDEF), the employers’ lobby organisations in the respective countries. I took particular exception to a passage concerning the Hartz Commission. A kind of commission is proposed at European level based on the German model, but evidently the governments in London, Berlin and Paris do not realise that a European directive on temporary employment, the cornerstone of the Hartz Commission, is already under discussion in Brussels. An extraordinary deal has been struck between London and Berlin concerning that very directive, to block any decisions being taken on it; a deal which has to do with another dossier, the takeover bids directive, which is also being discussed at the moment. It is absolutely absurd that, in the self same letter that has now been drawn up ahead of the Spring Summit, it is proposed to set up a kind of Hartz Commission that reinvents the wheel, instead of now working constructively on that directive and a decision being taken on it in March, within the Economic and Social Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The social repercussions of possible military intervention in Iraq and its impact on the European economy are giving great cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Just what is it within the Union that ties it to outside developments? According to the snapshot presented by the Commission, things are not so rosy when it comes to the open method of coordination between the Member States at all levels within the Union. For example, there has been too little progress towards the objective of sustainable economic development, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion which we set in 2000. Some Member States have completely failed to meet targets for employment and competitiveness, with the result that the word now is that we shall not achieve the target set by the Union in the Lisbon strategy. We therefore need to review what has been done and examine everything left on the to-do list, especially in the Member States which have fallen short.</p>
<p class="contents">Again on the subject of sustainable development, we need to plug the gap between the announcements we make and the legislative tools we provide for protecting the environment and public health and we need to mainstream the environmental dimension in all Union policies. With pressure from both the Lisbon process and the process of reviewing the Union Treaties and, of course, globalisation, we urgently need to apply sustainable development within the context of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I want to focus on and highlight once again is this: I think, no I believe that the European Union is lagging behind in science and technology, especially biotechnology. Without scientific and technological progress and innovation we shall be unable to meet the challenges – the nutritional, medical, environmental and socio-economic challenges. Science and technology are the key to dealing with the major problems that beset human society. This has always been a basic element in the history of man and it still is today. Scientific, technological and related research, education and training are therefore non-negotiable. And in my opinion, Mr President-in-Office, you should take decisive action to promote research in science and technology, as the President of the Commission said, because it will, I think, turn out to be the most important tool in achieving the Lisbon policy, strategy and programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bullmann (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am indeed very well aware of the backdrop against which the Greek Presidency of the Council is obliged to make preparations for the Spring Summit. What makes it certainly the most difficult Spring Summit since Lisbon, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is the global economic situation and the prospect of an imminent war, which we hope yet to be able to prevent. In a situation such as this, a great deal of responsibility rests upon your shoulders, but there is only one mistake you can make, a very serious one, and that would be if you were to allow your courage to fail you – the courage to, for once, push to one side the declarations prepared by the many bureaucracies; the courage to distance yourself to some degree from the anaemic statements, all couched in the same language; the courage to engage in real discussion among yourselves of the real conditions under which the people of the European Union live. We know from former Presidents of the Council that finding the courage to break with ritual is perhaps the hardest thing of all. It is not simple. Let me give two reasons why I think it essential that you summon up the courage to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">What we learn from an unvarnished depiction of the situation is that investment, both private and public, in Europe is at a low point. We have to take especial note of the fact that public-sector investment is collapsing in those economies on which a major part of our economic development depends. This is where ritual invocation of the Stability and Growth Pact is not enough. When will we at last affirm our belief in the golden rule and put fresh wind and impetus behind increased investment in Europe? I, for one, want to hear no more from Members of this House who ritually affirm the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises without at the same time stressing the link with public investment. This question demands an answer, and soon. You are in a position to do this, and you can get it done.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second aspect that seems to me to be of great importance. Wonderful papers are produced on active ageing. I know about the demographic situation, and about how important it is to keep people active as they get older, but if you ask the European public, what you come up against is the great difficulty you have in persuading someone who has worked in a factory for forty years, perhaps working shifts, to carry on doing that job. You will find it even more difficult to convince a businessman that this worker has to keep on working longer, and, in particular, even more difficult than that when people out there know that these papers are written by people who reckon on going in their fifties or early fifties with a golden handshake. If you really want to do something, do some work on health programmes in the workplace, do something about enabling people to have an early-retirement part-time pension, and then, above all, ask yourself how it is that nearly 20% of our young people still end up on the labour market without proper training? These people are the future of Europe, and we force them into unemployment. This is an urgent problem, and I do not find anything like enough about it in our papers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore insist on the aspects which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party considers to be most important in this preparation for the Spring Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on assessing the results so far since Lisbon, we observe that, rather than making progress – at least in relative terms – we have moved backwards. If we compare the levels of productivity in the European Union and in the United States we see that the European Union comes out worse. We believe that this is because we have not been able to make sufficient progress on a framework favourable to business initiative for investment. This is because, despite the declarations made at the successive Councils in Lisbon, Gothenburg and Barcelona, there has not been adequate action on the part of the Member States, which have committed themselves to making a series of reforms, of which the really important ones are reforms to make the labour market more flexible, to promote an environment more favourable for the creation of companies, at a time when growth forecasts within the European Union are low. Small and medium-sized enterprises are key, but it has been demonstrated that the bureaucratic obstacles to creating a new business are infinitely greater in the European Union than in the United States. This is not a favourable environment either for the creation of companies or for small and medium-sized businesses or, above all, for those companies which are taking a new direction by applying new technologies. Therefore, the twin objective of creating companies and applying and developing new technologies has also been significantly delayed and clearly, despite the successive commitments and solemn declarations, which were repeated in Barcelona, on the process of liberalisation of sectors which are still protected, in energy and telecommunications we see once again that they have not been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that rather than making great declarations, the Brussels Summit will fulfil its commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At worst, it has not made any headway. Clearly, it is developing and progressing too slowly. The recession which has hit the economy, especially the sectors of the new economy on which we have – to put it one way – somewhat over-optimistically pinned our hopes for the Lisbon strategy, cannot be left out of the equation. As far as sustainable development is concerned, there has been a huge delay. We should already be fully monitoring and developing the outcomes of Johannesburg. I think that both the word and the town have been forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the letter from the three leaders, which a previous speaker quite rightly referred to and which really does upset the balance which the Lisbon strategy tries to strike. This letter calls for reform, but reform in the wrong direction. The letter ditches the term full employment and talks of high levels of employment. It says – and this is outrageous, Mr President-in-Office and I should like you to respond to this – that we need to prevent new restrictions on companies and that, whenever the Commission proposes new policies, we need to listen to the opinion of companies and the business world first. I have nothing against consultation, but what will you do about the legislation on chemicals? What will you do about the new legislation on environmental responsibility? In one sense, these laws are restrictions which come within the context of sustainable development and so on. Will they too be left out of the equation? I think an answer is required. If not now, then during the discussions at summit level. In all events, a clear answer is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously the war, or rather, let us not deceive ourselves, the invasion of Iraq may exacerbate all this and does, of course, make it hard to get down to brass tacks and discuss the follow-on strategy for Lisbon. However, a number of questions need answering, Mr President. Have you thought about re-tabling a general reduction in working times in order to create more jobs? About funding the development of the so-called third sector? About updating the ideas in the White Paper, which was when we last thought about this in a specific, integrated manner in the European Union, for example on trans-European networks and tax changes, in order to shift taxes off employment and on to the use of natural resources. Have you thought about re-tabling all this in the light of the failures so far? Or has all this now been forgotten? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that now, of all times, we need to testify in strong support of the value of the European model, not only as a market, but especially as a model for well-being, sustainability, development, and the prosperity which is tied up with well-being. That is why we have made a conscious decision to support integration in place of confrontation, unity in diversity, and world development in place of dominance. And so we have brought about the upcoming enlargement of the Union, but, at the same time, we are confronted with the growth of unemployment. At this time, therefore, we need leadership from the Commission, the Council, Parliament, the  EU institutions and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States, regions, local authorities and heads of businesses alike fail to deliver the goods, however. They all sit on top of their heaps of gold, exercising caution and not doing what needs to be done in order to combat this unemployment. Believe me, if we carry out enlargement of Europe with unemployment still hanging over our heads, we will be heading for an utter fiasco.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk of research – we have failed to bring about a real European policy for this. Our <span class="italic">doctores honoris causa</span> still come to our universities to collect their honorary doctorates, before returning to the USA to work in very high-performance laboratories. Why are we doing so little; why are so many countries lagging behind in terms of research? If sustainable development is to be possible, each country must do more than it is currently doing, and together we must do more than we are currently doing. For we must admit that when times were good – times are not so good now, but we must turn the tide – we did actually see, to our regret, that regions with high unemployment also remained regions of high unemployment when they were part of the Union. On top of that there is also cyclical unemployment. At the same time, we can see that, across the board, there are still semi- and unskilled workers who are out of work, still too few women in the labour force, too few people in work, and businesses that systematically show their staff the door when they reach 52; and there are still too many countries that endorse this behaviour and even give government money for it. Have we not been fobbed off in that regard with nice summits and fine words for long enough now? I hope that now, some action will be the result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is seriously weakened on both counts, to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace has been compromised by the unbelievable violation of the Treaties by Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Denmark, signatories of the Maastricht Treaty, and I doubt that the summit called on Monday by the Greek Presidency will change very much. In reality, European policy amounts to very little and even that is very weak. There is not more new Europe than old Europe. There is quite simply no Europe at all.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as prosperity is concerned, which is more the subject of this debate, the reason that Union policy is half what it could be is an antiquated monetary policy that was put together for an old Europe. The Malthusian policy of the European Central Bank, which has been reiterated enough in this House, is the main cause of European stagnation and, soon, recession. So, Mr Prodi and the Greek President-in-Office, if you hold a Spring Summit, make it worthy of its name! Bring the European economy out of the monetary winter that it has been plunged into by the policy of the European Central Bank. The proof is the very report that you published on the competitiveness of European countries after the Lisbon Summit. Which are the three countries that come out best, the three countries on the podium? Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, precisely the countries that did not adopt the euro. They are doing better in terms of unemployment, inflation, debt and competitiveness, than the countries that adopted the euro. So spot the mistake! And now that you are pleased with yourselves – I heard Mr Goebbels this morning rejoicing that the euro is finally picking up – that the euro is beating the dollar, the long-held dream, be aware that the more the euro goes up, the more European growth will decline. Your ego will be flattered, but the result will be seventeen thousand more unemployed each month, as happened again in France last month. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>In its report to the European Council on 21 March, the Commission invited the Member States to step up their efforts to comply with the objective that they set in Lisbon in Spring 2000: creating the most competitive and dynamic economy within ten years. This call is welcome, because today we look more like an old Europe falling into a depression.</p>
<p class="contents">In reaction to this, the Commission and the Council have just presented some interesting action plans, particularly for the European research area, which should enable us to attract the best brains in the world and also to keep them, I would like to add, through a taxation system designed not to dissuade them from staying. However, the main responsibilities lie with the Member States, and the European Union needs to help them better in several areas.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, firstly, we need to ensure that standard European rules do not make the existing rules more inflexible. On paper, standardisation leads to savings in terms of information and transactions, but in practice, it also leads to many costs because a standard rule is liable not to be suited to anyone. That is undoubtedly what is happening with the euro. Let us not repeat this type of error too much. In particular, let us preserve flexibility and truly open economic and social co-ordination, in other words not covertly proposing standard solutions to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to stop the Convention moving towards a super-State, which would be cumbersome and restrictive. In particular, we need to entirely reject the European tax that is looming, which would further increase our compulsory contributions, either straight away or later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union must help the Member States to only take in immigration that is useful on the labour market. Influxes of immigrants of every category are weighing too heavily on our public finances and on the workings of our societies. Yes, we need to help the poorest people more, but we need to do it where they are, and in our mutual interest. In this respect, the Commission needs to radically change its policy, as I said yesterday when discussing the Terrón i Cusí report.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Union must defend our interests more forcefully on the international scene. We are tired of seeing that the Commission is again going to offer the WTO, with the agreement of the Council, a 36% reduction in our agricultural customs duties, destroying the Community preference a little more. On the contrary, if we want to gently reduce budgetary support, at the same time we need to strengthen the Community preference. The Member States need to make greater efforts for reform, that is true, but the Union needs to support them and not make their task more difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It seems to me that the entire debate can be summarised in three key words, three key messages. The first is confidence, the second is action and the third is balance, the European model. Let me explain myself.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion, what the citizens of the European Union want to come out of a Council such as the Spring Summit, which has an agenda of important and extensive issues, is confidence, not just in the abstract sense, but based on a realisation that the European Union is in a position to take decisions on growth, on employment in these difficult times and on a series of other issues of real concern to our citizens in their everyday life, such as social issues, pensions, health, education and quality of life. This is an aspect that, I think, mainly has to do with economic and social affairs. However, I think that, especially in today’s circumstances, questions of confidence do not arise solely from decisions relating specifically to Lisbon matters. We are in a period, to paraphrase Tolstoy, of ‘War or Peace’ and Europe’s confidence in the European Union will also depend on the decisions it takes on political issues. Everyone is waiting to see what decisions we, as the European Union, are in a position to take. The Greek Presidency, in agreement with its partners, has convened a special summit on political issues next Monday, in order to consider how we can make sure Europe is in the thick of things and how we can gain the confidence of the citizens of Europe on this front and prove that Europe can progress, that it can progress in an organised fashion and that it can take decisions. President Prodi mentioned the importance of this sort of image under present circumstances and I shall have an opportunity to say more on this during this afternoon’s debate on Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">This confidence, to come back to Lisbon, touches on a series of issues for which, as a number of speakers quite rightly mentioned, there is no institutional basis for progressing as one might perhaps wish. However, they are issues on which progress must be made and the open method of coordination, which has proven its worth over recent years post Lisbon, has injected flexibility into the Community system and allowed us to make some headway. I think the debate under way in the Convention may give us a more efficient institutional system, which could allow us to make decisions which are important to the citizens of Europe rather than getting entrenched in specific remits which prevent Europe from moving forward on a series of day-to-day issues. Greece, not as the presidency but as a Member State, is one of the countries that wants us to move in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I noted from the debate and want to highlight is the real need for action. We do not need new objectives, we need to implement much that has already been decided. Everyone realises this, the presidency realises this, the Council also realises this and we are working in this direction. However, I should like to point out that, whatever you may say about Lisbon’s progress to date, it is also worth remembering and highlighting the positive developments. I should just like to mention employment, because that was one of the main points of Lisbon, and remind you that, during these difficult years, with a recession in 2002, Europe managed to create 600 000 new jobs and that between 1999, the year before Lisbon, and 2003, an estimated 7 000 000 new jobs have been created in Europe. I know we also have the problem of unemployment, but mentioning this does not play down existing problems; I just want to point out that we have to see not just where we have failed to hit target; we also have to look at what has been achieved in relation to the targets set.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on another basic Lisbon issue, to do with balanced policies. I really do believe that Lisbon is one of Europe’s many responses, and a very serious response, to the issue of globalisation. And that is very, very important. The whole core idea of Lisbon revolves around the key word of balance, balanced policies. What we have to decide, of course, is how we can strike a balance between policies to strengthen competitiveness and policies to strengthen the social dimension. It seems to me that you have to decide how to answer this. How to answer the need to strengthen and remove all limits on the market system and, at the same time, strengthen issues to do with employment, the social model or the concept of growth and the concept of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of post-war Europe has been built on its ability to find a satisfactory answer to the question of balanced policies. We cannot compare Europe with other models without thinking about it very carefully and setting certain limits. We can use benchmarking in each country to see where we were before and where we are now. We can even use it between Member States of the European Union; but benchmarking between the European Union and other countries is another matter, because no country anywhere in the world has developed the elements that typify and constitute the post-war European development and social model. No country has fast rates of growth and social protection and sustainable development and environmental protection all at once, meaning that any benchmarking is flawed. Useful yes, as long as you are aware of its very narrow limitations. We know what the price will be if we ignore the demands of competitiveness. So we are forced to proceed in the direction of key factors that currently strengthen the competitive potential of our economy. Otherwise we shall achieve nothing. However, we also know what the repercussions may be if competitiveness is our only criterion or if employment, or social protection or environmental protection are our only criteria. I think that all our concerns centre around how we can safeguard the Europe we know, by which I do not mean safeguarding old inflexible structures, I mean safeguarding old values and achievements, taking account of the fact that times have changed and that we need to move with the times if we are to have the sort of success we had in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous speakers rightly raised issues to do with employment and employment arrangements. One of the hardest problems is how to tread the fine line between the need for flexibility and the need to strengthen competitiveness and job standards and protect workers. These are the values we have always known in Europe and these are the values we want to safeguard. No one objective takes precedence. There is a very fine balance between all of them and therein lies the rub, therein lies the concern; Europe has acted on this concern for years and has managed to find its own answer. We believe that it will be able to find a new answer to these issues in this new, difficult phase.</p>
<p class="contents">One speaker pointed out or, if you like, criticised the fact there is no specific emphasis on sustainable development or the environment. I should like to start by reminding you that it is Europe as a whole that has put the emphasis on environmental issues. We in Europe have done this, which is why we are critical of other countries which have not signed the Kyoto agreement and so on. Of course, we still have a great deal to do in this direction. We, the presidency, want to focus over the next few months on removing obstacles to environmental technologies, strengthening procedures to promote renewable sources of energy, promoting approaches which allow transport infrastructures to be properly costed and polluting sources of energy to be taxed and examining the report on the environment which will be submitted at the spring Council. We also agree that the question of investments and trans-European networks are important issues in the current phase of low manufacturing output in Europe, and it is vital that we find new, innovative ways of funding and boosting investments in both the private and public sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues arising from enlargement are important in relation to the Lisbon strategy. The Lisbon strategy basically summarises the European development and social model and, if we want to make enlargement a real success rather than just a decision to enlarge the European Union, we need to see how we can extend the main elements of this model to the new countries, how we can set up social, economic and political structures in most of the new Member States, which still have quite a long way to go to meet current European standards, and how we can transplant these standards and promote unification. This is a new challenge for everyone and, of course, for several presidencies, not just the Greek Presidency or this spring Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close with the letter received by the presidency from the three leaders already referred to. This is one contribution and we want to examine it. We have had contributions from other Member States which have not perhaps received as much publicity. They raise a series of issues which the spring Council will be examining and I agree with the Member who said that the European Union will need to demonstrate in March – the presidency does not of course have magic powers and cannot decide on behalf of the Fifteen – the Fifteen will need to demonstrate that, despite the climate in which we are operating, we have managed to take decisions which will open up prospects, build confidence and work for the future good of the European Union.</p>

I would just like to emphasise the tone of this debate which has been, I would say, characterised by considerable pessimism. It is clear that this is not the best of times, in both political and economic terms. Nevertheless, we have a doctrine and rules which all of us here have endorsed. I can assure you that if we persevere in forging ahead with this doctrine, with these rules, we will not fail to see results. We have created the largest, and I would say, potentially the most efficient market structure in the world. We have established rules, and know where we want to go; progress, obviously, is slow because this entails transfers of power and transfers of competence which are always difficult to carry out. Some States are pushing ahead, others are dragging their heels, but remember that it is our duty – the duty of Parliament and the Commission – to lead everyone back to the course that must be followed and the journey that must be completed. And you will see that results will not fail to arrive soon.</p>
