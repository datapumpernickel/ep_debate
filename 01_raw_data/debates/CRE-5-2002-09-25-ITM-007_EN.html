<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the other parliamentary groups for supporting our initiative of 8 August for an oral question, following a trip to Latin America to see the effects of the crisis and ascertain the expectations of the Latin-American countries with regard to the European Union. Secondly, I would like to welcome the compromise resolution in which the European Parliament will show – as I hope it will tomorrow – its unanimous support for a clearly determined direction established by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we are asking has three parts. The first is that, from the very positive experiences of the association treaties with Mexico and the treaty we have just signed with Chile, we believe that we need to speed up negotiations – Commissioner Patten was in Rio de Janeiro in July with Commissioner Lamy – for three basic reasons. First, because we need to consolidate the political and economic integration of Mercosur. Secondly, because this is an instrument for stability – we hope it will be – to give investors confidence, to be a factor in economic growth and also to help consolidate democracy in these countries. Thirdly, last but not least, because we are the main investor and the main commercial partner in this area, ahead of the United States. And it is appropriate that we should talk about commerce, the economy and subjects such as the International Criminal Court, the WTO, Kyoto, etc., in order to consolidate these alliances.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is that we can make progress on some of the proposals of a transitional nature we are currently putting forward, taking account of the need for aid in order to overcome the crisis – in particular, I am thinking of certain agri-fisheries aspects which can subsequently be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect is that we are facing a significant problem with regard to the representation of the European Union in international bodies, which, I admit, is difficult to solve. We need to address this in the Convention and consolidate our positions, but you will acknowledge that in the case of the Commission’s mission to Rio de Janeiro, Commissioner Patten was not in the same situation as Commissioner Lamy. Commissioner Lamy has commercial power, as he showed in our negotiations in the WTO. In the case of the International Monetary Fund, we found that, although we jointly have 30% of the vote, due to special rules for negotiating, the United States, with 17%, carries more weight than we do. We must find a solution to this which allows us, within the scope of Article 99 of the Treaties, to be represented as a whole and thus carry enough weight to reflect our responsibilities and size. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resolution firmly expresses the solidarity that the Europeans share with the peoples with whom we have so many historical ties through friendship and even family. Unfortunately, this solidarity is not expressed by means of a co-ordinated position of the Member States in the international financial institutions, which are in fact largely responsible for the disaster in Argentina, as a former IMF Chief Economist, Professor Stieglitz, demonstrated so well. The resolution quite rightly calls for our policies to be co-ordinated in order to provide financial aid to the Mercosur countries and to include these new guidelines in the EU-Mercosur agreement that is currently being negotiated. These negotiations also cover external debt, the ethical position of businesses and the European banks.</p>
<p class="contents">So, there are many good resolutions, and yet the issue remains and will without a shadow of a doubt be raised in the US: does Europe really wish to save South America? In order to calm the fears of our Mercosur partners, we must listen to their demands and dot the i’s and cross the t’s. Hence the three amendments that we tabled to our own resolution: firstly, the very clear rejection of financial conditions which would further exacerbate the poverty of the Mercosur peoples, such as lowering salaries or making cuts in public services. Secondly, Europe’s renunciation of its subsidies for agricultural dumping for exports that are largely responsible for Mercosur’s difficulties, and lastly, the creation of a bilateral citizen’s committee so that the representatives of our societies can be involved in the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union and the Member States must therefore act as one to ensure that the International Monetary Fund finds a solution to all this suffering and need.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it should be pointed out that the solution must involve creating stable employment. The economy needs to recover and we must help the people so that they can trust us. It is important for the European Union that Latin America should trust us, and we must therefore give priority to this matter.</p>

This is not our observation, but that of the Heads of State of Mercosur at their meeting in Asunción last September.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that circumstances are not helping much: presidential elections in Brazil in the next few weeks; spectacular devaluation of the real over the past few days, stock market slump in Brazil; contamination in Uruguay; presidential elections and ongoing crisis in Argentina in March; presidential elections, too, in April next year in Paraguay – if they are held, taking into account that, when the delegation was there in July, a state of emergency was declared.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look elsewhere on the continent, the scene is no more promising: instability in Venezuela, an extremely delicate situation in Colombia, a spectacular fall in public support for President Toledo in Peru – who is due to visit this House in December – and general unease throughout the region. In other words, the progress that has been made with regard to coexistence and democratisation are at risk, if none is made in the fight against poverty. What are the Mercosur countries saying about this? They are saying, more Mercosur, more integration and more and better democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to respond decisively to these problems, and I believe that what Mr Barón Crespo was saying is perfectly logical: as Parliament has said on numerous occasions, we need to promote this association agreement. We ask the Commission, once the elections are over, to promote the chapters which are not yet closed. The signals given to the Commission with regard to giving EUR 200 million and the increase in the Hilton quota are extremely positive, and I believe we must continue to send these positive signals.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has asked – and this is an initiative that will not cost another euro – for a regional solidarity fund to be created using the existing budgetary appropriations. I ask the Commission to consider this initiative and I believe it is particularly important for the EU Member States to back a swift solution and agreement with Argentina in the International Monetary Fund. I seem to recall that currently only two Member States have firmly supported this agreement between Argentina and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, we must show solidarity with Argentina because I believe it is deserved, and because this solidarity would clearly be to our own advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Madam President, by recalling something said by a well-known Argentine Minister: there is no point in travelling first class when an economy passenger has a bomb in their hand luggage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would stress the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, first of all, for speeding up negotiations and achieving a new agreement, which certainly meets the planned schedule and, if possible, speeds it up in order to send a positive message with regard to the good will of the European Union in this integration process. Positive signals have already been sent, including Commission aid of EUR 200 million, which we believe should be supplemented, as stated in the motion for a joint resolution. The use of preferential commercial mechanisms should also be used in order to promote commerce and economic recovery in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this process of greater integration and greater cooperation by the European Union, in conjunction with international financial bodies, should be used to carry out and consolidate the search for robust, credible, rigorous economic programmes to restore confidence in both economic recovery and in investment flow, which the Mercosur economies, and in particular Argentina, clearly need in order to overcome the serious economic, social and political situation they are currently experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that in the various references that have been made to international financial institutions and to the International Monetary Fund in particular, the Argentine crisis, once again, shows the need for the European Union to act more directly, with its own voice, to address this type of subject within these bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must, therefore, devote our full attention to these difficulties, and by ‘we’ I mean not only Parliament, but also the Council and the Commission. These countries are facing political, economic and social challenges that require permanent international cooperation underpinned by a spirit of solidarity and mutual respect. Most of us share this objective, although it is felt particularly strongly, as you would expect, by those Member States, such as my own, Portugal, that have special cultural, historical and linguistic links with these countries. We believe that relations between the European Union and the Mercosur countries are strategic relations, comparable, incidentally, to those that Mercosur is developing with other parts of the world and to which we usually give priority status. I say this not only in light of the already-mentioned principles of solidarity or of the region’s defence of the rule of law and of the economic model based on free initiative and on improving working conditions, but also because of the opportunity that a revitalised and concrete EU-Mercosur partnership would represent for a more balanced political and economic profile of the Union and its Member States in that region of the American continent.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we ask the Council – in the wake of the recent Madrid Summit – to prioritise cooperation with the Mercosur countries, with this cooperation being translated into practical measures that go beyond rhetorical gestures of solidarity with their peoples. Strong political signals that reaffirm European Union confidence in that region must be given, ensuring that cooperation policy is based on the principle of association to the benefit of both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make another observation: we cannot combat the phenomenon of the unilateralism being demonstrated by the United States – visible mainly in its external and defence policy, admittedly – only with the criticism that we have been hearing in certain circles of European thought. This criticism, which on top of everything is not accompanied by proposals for political and financial measures that would allow us to overcome the causes of an apparent European inferiority complex, could easily be redirected into stepping up strategic actions of this type. These would prove more useful in balancing relations between the two continents in an atmosphere of cooperation and of sharing values common to both.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the problems that we are seeing in the region must not affect the course of the negotiations currently taking place between the European Union and Mercosur. Instead, the crisis – which we know is complex and problematic – must act as a stimulus for an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties to be concluded as rapidly as possible. Lastly, we are in no doubt that everyone would gain by taking advantage of the opportunities that these closer ties would normally provide to encourage the rapid recovery of the economies of the Mercosur countries and closer relations with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly through the GSP’s generalised systems, they can, as Mr Barón Crespo mentioned, be given the opportunity to increase their own export income, promote industrialisation in their own countries and speed up the diversification of their economies as a stability tool.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone here must be alert to the fact that the members of the international financial bodies, namely the Bretton Woods institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are sovereign states unto themselves. They are not subject to the dictates of the European Council or to joint decision-making by the European Council. It is therefore up to these states themselves, and not to the Council, to decide how they are to conduct themselves in these international financial bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nonetheless clear that coordination between the EU Member States in relation to Article 19 of the EU Treaty may be of benefit to their work in these institutions. Accordingly, there is in actual fact a degree of informal coordination at intergovernmental level within the framework of the institutions I mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Member States’ efforts to remedy the situation in the Mercosur countries, they are participating fully and actively in the IMF’s work to secure stability and sustainable economic growth in the region. It would be foolish to do otherwise. The arrangements made to support Paraguay, Uruguay and, most recently, Brazil have received backing from the EU Member States, and work is being done on securing a strong, sustainable and credible IMF programme for Argentina, as outlined in the Council’s conclusions of 21 January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In his question on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Barón Crespo states that the negotiations concerning the association and free-trade agreement with Mercosur are expected to be concluded in 2003. The parties have not set any deadline for the conclusion of the negotiations, the date’s depending therefore upon how the negotiations progress. In July, the negotiators at ministerial level adopted an ambitious work programme for the next twelve months. The European Union has undertaken to reach a comprehensive agreement with Mercosur and make further progress in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me therefore to conclude that the Council is fully alert to the serious crisis in the Mercosur countries, especially Argentina. It is absolutely right that it should be taken seriously. We are therefore interested in strengthening relations between the EU and Mercosur and promoting trade, and we also had a meeting with them during the General Assembly in New York last week. First of all, everyone here must be aware of the need to go home and say to our own governments that they themselves must work in the IMF on behalf of the institutions and say to the Mercosur countries that, first of all, they themselves must implement the financial changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, the Commission fully shares the view of honourable Members that Mercosur’s financial problems have intensified during the summer. The European Union and the Commission are concerned at the financial turbulence that is affecting the entire Mercosur region. The turmoil was triggered by the economic and banking crisis in Argentina, which led to spillover effects on other Mercosur countries such as Uruguay and Brazil. As a result, the social and economic indicators, as the honourable Member indicated, are pointing sharply in the wrong direction; poverty is increasing and GDP has declined in all Mercosur countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis will require deep economic and political structural reforms. The Commission is convinced that one of the answers to the financial and economic turbulence should be deeper and faster regional integration. In this respect, the European Union and the Commission strongly support the Mercosur integration process, especially at this crucial moment for the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The European message of support for further integration as one of the responses to the present crisis is confirmed by our strong commitment to intensify and accelerate negotiations for an Association Agreement between the European Union and Mercosur. The agreement will create improved market access for Mercosur exports to the European Union and it will strengthen Mercosur as a common market. In addition, from the political and cooperation point of view, it will be a clear signal of a strengthening of EU-Mercosur relations.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament knows, the EU-Mercosur negotiations are highly ambitious and include three pillars: political dialogue, cooperation and a comprehensive trade agenda. To date, we have virtually finalised the political and cooperation chapters. At the recent Rio Ministerial Meeting on 23 July 2002 which, as the honourable Member noted, I attended, an ambitious work programme for the trade negotiations was established. This includes a ministerial meeting during the second half of next year to kick off what we hope will be the final stage of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the interregional negotiations, the Commission has considered additional forms of help to alleviate the Mercosur crisis. Firstly, on the trade front, the European Union has taken important decisions to increase the allocation of the Hilton Beef Quota for two Mercosur countries: 10 000 additional tonnes to Argentina and, as a first step, 1 000 tonnes to Paraguay. It is also worth remembering that Mercosur countries have benefited, as my honourable friend the President-in-Office pointed out, from the EU GSP mechanism for quite a long time. The latest review of the regime entered into force on 1 January 2002 and it should expire on 31 December 2004. At this stage it is not possible temporarily to adjust GSP preferences only for the Mercosur countries, as some have suggested. However, we remain committed to helping Mercosur countries to benefit further from the current system.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been coordination of the positions taken by our Member States on the South American crisis by means of Council common positions and public statements on Argentina. It must be said that this falls short of actual coordination of positions in the International Monetary Fund. The Mercosur crisis shows that it would desirable for the European Union to speak with a single voice and play a more influential role in international financial matters.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament knows, the European Commission cannot intervene as such in the definition of the criteria imposed by an international organisation like the IMF – in which, as I have said, European Union Member States are represented – for the grant of loans to certain countries in a crisis situation. The approval of IMF assistance as such is based on its own criteria and is tied to sustainable economic programmes proposed by the governments of the countries affected by financial or economic problems. We believe it is only natural that the conditions imposed by international organisations like the IMF for the concession of loans for the structural adjustment of countries undergoing a crisis are different from those set by international cooperation organisations like the UN Development Programme for the concession of grants. These organisations have different objectives, which explains why the UN Development Programme puts more emphasis on the social component of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">But above and beyond any discussions on the merits of any of the criteria used by international organisations, we should not lose sight of the fact that the crisis requires fundamental economic reform in the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission adopted in August a substantial cooperation package in favour of the Mercosur countries covering EUR 200 million for the period 2002-2006. These programmes will support regional integration, economic reform, social development and poverty alleviation, modernisation of the state and protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an additional EUR 48 million for the period 2002-2006 has been allocated to cooperation with Mercosur as a whole and it is focused on three priority areas: support to the implementation of the Mercosur internal market; support to Mercosur institutionalisation; and support for civil society in Mercosur.</p>
<p class="contents">In sum, there is a package of EUR 250 million to be made available in the period 2002-2006 – of which EUR 30 million are planned to be committed in 2002. I hope this is another sign of our long-term commitment to Mercosur.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final brief point. We have just held meetings in Copenhagen with the ASEM countries and individual meetings with South Korea, China, and Indonesia. In the last few years – at least until the recent crisis, and for a change – European investment in Latin America outstripped investment in Asia. It is interesting to compare the two regions and to compare for example the savings ratio in Asia with that in Latin America. Because domestic savings are so much lower in Latin America, it has depended much more on foreign direct investment in order to promote economic growth. The problem in today's liberalised global market is that just as money can go in, so it can just as rapidly go out again. The only answer to poverty in Latin America is sustainable economic development. We can only have sustainable economic development when we have sustained investment. So there is a very strong argument for trying to increase domestic savings ratios in Latin America and for looking at financial flows in the way that Chile did a few years ago and trying to ensure that they become stabilising rather than destabilising factors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, despite the efforts made over the past decade, the situation in Mercosur and Latin America in general is once again a cause for concern. The regional associations are adversely affected and Mercosur is suffering serious problems, preventing it from getting off the ground. We do not know if the Argentine crisis has reached its lowest point, Uruguay and Paraguay are experiencing serious difficulties and Brazil, despite considerable aid from the International Monetary Fund, is, at the very least, cause for certain doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and each Member State can and must do far more. The de-institutionalisation of the region, the loss of prestige of parties and politicians, the strong upsurge in certain populist movements and tyranny that have caused so many problems in Latin America are all worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot continue to sit by passively observing the extreme situation in Argentina. Mr Patten, if we look at the Union budget, the budgetary headings allocated to the development of the region of Latin America as a whole do not always confirm what you have just told us. It is true that Mercosur has regressed, just as Mr Patten said. It is also true that in Argentina, it is the leaders themselves who must adopt measures to prevent the situation, which is already serious enough in itself, from worsening. This involves economic, fiscal and financial measures and sacrifices requiring still greater effort for the Argentine people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union and its Member States, however, should adopt drastic measures to kickstart these countries’ economies, which should be covered by the Community budget, and which are not currently included, giving special priority to exports and showing the necessary courage and resolve so that our representatives in the international financial bodies can adopt these measures urgently in order to prevent further delays. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not wish to repeat it all. I should just like to make two short comments and refer to Mr Patten's final remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I have been working on Latin America for many years and – to my horror, I have to say – I have observed that Latin America's importance on the world stage is diminishing further every year, while Asia's is growing. There must be reasons for this, reasons that are far more complex than just a measure or two. We should discuss this openly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment that I wanted to make concerns a survey that was carried out recently in Latin America. Part of the population – around 20 000 people – were asked whether they believed that authoritarian governments were better able to solve the problems than democracies. In 1996 in a similar survey only a minority put an authoritarian regime first; the majority was in favour of democracy. Today over 50% of the population are saying: yes, we need authoritarian governments to solve our problems. This means that the crisis that we are facing today in Latin America, and in particular in Mercosur, also presents a risk to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This reminds me of the eighties and early nineties when our debates on Latin America mainly concerned democracy. At that time we understood that we needed to pursue a social and economic policy that restored people's faith in democracy. That is why I do not think that it is pointless for us to concern ourselves with Latin America; if we do not then we will only end up drafting more motions on dictatorships.</p>

The social and economic crises constantly afflicting these countries are preventing economic growth in South America and hindering the implementation of a sustainable development programme because of the frequent economic problems caused by structural instability.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore firmly believe that the European Union must place South America and the Mercosur countries at the centre of its focus, although not to the detriment of the environmental protection policy, of course, which is becoming an essential tool for the preservation of green areas which are part of the world’s heritage. To this end, the creation of a special trade programme for countries in difficulties and the promotion of agreements with international bodies which can successfully reduce the crisis threatening the stability of the entire continent would seem appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we need to review the trade agreements we have with these countries and relations between Europe and Mercosur. The barriers to trade, the constraints on trade between the European Union and South America, need to be removed in order to boost the world’s economy, which is under threat from these crises. We must not forget that Europe is the principal trading partner of the Mercosur countries, and it would be easier for these countries to recover and to resolve their socio-political problems if they were economically stable and opened up to trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to renegotiate the external debt and establish a system of equality between the different Mercosur countries in order to protect fundamental human rights and prevent the emergence of socio-cultural problems such as those currently afflicting the continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Patten knows the Far East extremely well – he has been closely involved there – and the majority of today’s speakers probably know South America better.</p>
<p class="contents">He has described the situation in very clear and very economic terms, and that is that, while the countries of the Far East have in recent years gone from misery – by adapting to the new situation – to a higher standard of living, in the countries of Latin America the standard of living has declined and, in 50 or 60 years, a country such as Argentina has gone from exceeding the European average to being below it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Patten is right, but the problem is that at the moment – this is what the Latin American countries tell us – the international system is obliging the countries of Latin America to reduce their standard of living, to proletarianise and to introduce a genuine revolution, in other words, to ‘Asianise’ itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is cultural and serious.

To my knowledge there is no ban on criticising the International Monetary Fund or similar institutions and I do not regard them as sacrosanct. I was also pleased to hear Commissioner Patten say that certain import quotas in the agricultural sector have been or are being increased. I think, however, that even if we doubled or tripled all of these measures, we would not get to the root of the problem. Mercosur has everything it needs. It has oil, gas, all the important raw materials, and enough agricultural products to feed not only the whole of Latin America but Europe as well. It has a competent workforce and it has a diverse industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take up something that Mr Linkohr said: the causes of this crisis run deeper, and not only economic reforms but also political reforms are necessary. It is precisely the most important Mercosur States that have far-reaching political problems. They have inefficient and, in some cases, corrupt political systems. Anyone who has been to a rich, thriving country like Argentina and seen the desperate demonstrations by people from the entire political spectrum outside the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, calling for the resignation of all politicians in all parties, because they will not accept anyone anymore, can see quite clearly that this crisis is not a passing phase; it is democracy and the political system that is undergoing a fundamental crisis. That is why we obviously want to take individual steps, but without a thorough reform of the political system in Argentina, but also to some extent in Brazil, this continent will not shake off the crisis. So far, it must be seen in a positive light that, as a market, Mercosur has had the effect of preventing the worst – they have limped along by supporting each other – but in the long term the political system really needs to make a full recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has been irresponsibly negligent with regard to this matter, and we must drop this approach without further delay. I believe that we have serious moral responsibilities towards Latin America and that the North/South dialogue and cooperation and development are meaningless unless we translate our words into action.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, give coherence to the entire range of means with which Europe can act, from overcoming the differences within the Council – we could begin there – to effective and personalised intervention in the name of Europe in the framework of the IMF, to the possibilities opened up by our preferential trade mechanisms, to financial aid and the accession agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, all of this will mean a very considerable effort by Europe to reaffirm, as the resolution quite rightly states, our commitment of solidarity towards Latin America, which is also a commitment to democracy in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
