<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I would first of all like to make it clear that I am all for the further completion of the internal market, that is to say the removal of obstacles facing EU citizens in the area of free movement of goods, services and capital. I also welcome Commissioner Bolkestein’s dynamic approach in this respect. This development results in great economic expansion and has led to more prosperity in Europe. Also, the free movement of goods within the Union has become something which both citizens and industry take for granted. </p>
<p class="contents">There will undoubtedly be Swedish consumers who will benefit, and also find pleasure, from the Commission proposal once beer, wine and spirits, ranging from whisky and brandy to lesser products such as gammeldansk, shellfish in brine and Beerenburg, are more readily available. There is, therefore, no doubt in my mind as to the general benefits of the internal market. Despite this, I also have the impression that it is unsatisfactory to treat alcohol only as an issue which concerns the internal market or agricultural policy, as has often been the case. This is clearly an issue which also has major public health implications. </p>
<p class="contents">The main focus in the discussion on the internal market’s further liberalisation and completion is the economic goal of banishing unfair competition. The aspect of a high level of public health and consumer protection, as expressly included in Article 95 (3) of the Treaty, is sometimes overlooked although it forms an essential part of the European treaties. The European Community will need to carve itself a role in the increasing cooperation between Member States in collating data and exchanging expertise and best practices. Across the Union, we will also need to take into consideration the less attractive aspects of alcohol use, which also, unfortunately, exist. This is also in line with the pledge which the European Union made with regard to the World Health Organisation. Last year, all Member States agreed to back the second European alcohol action plan drafted by the WHO. It means that, by the year 2005, all European countries must have drafted a tax policy which contributes to a reduction in alcohol-related accidents. The action plan also underlines the huge need for a higher minimum tax for alcohol in the EU as part of a general health strategy. I understand that the Swedish Presidency will be organising a conference on this subject in Stockholm in early 2001. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore difficult to overlook the significance of the fiscal aspect in this connection. It has transpired that not only the fiscal instrument greatly impacts on total consumption, but that the tax level in a particular Member State also has a bearing on the neighbouring countries. Sweden is greatly affected by the excise level in Denmark which, in turn, is greatly influenced by Germany. In the United Kingdom, people cross the Channel to France on a massive scale to stock up on alcohol. The Commission has now levelled criticism at Sweden because the excise on wine is apparently too high in comparison with the excise on beer. Beer is produced in Sweden. But it is, of course, interesting in this connection to note that seven or so wine-producing EU Member States still apply a zero tax rate to wine. </p>
<p class="contents">In principle, fiscal measures are a matter governed by national sovereignty. But in order for the internal market to operate most effectively, Member States should strive for a higher degree of coordination in prescribing excise levels for alcoholic beverages. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the general benefits to be had from the internal market are beyond dispute. It is nonetheless unsatisfactory to treat alcohol only as an issue which concerns the internal market because it quite clearly has major social and public health implications, as well as implications for consumer protection. The government should not act as a moralist and the moderate use of alcohol poses no problem whatsoever, of course. It even has beneficial effects on health. But the use of alcohol which leads to fatalities on the roads, violence within the family and such like is not just a Swedish phenomenon by a long chalk. Public health and consumer protection should form an integral part of the European agenda, and it is encouraging that the European Parliament seems to be heading in this direction. The step-by-step abolition of restrictions, as proposed by the European Commission, gives the Swedish authorities the time to introduce alternative measures in order to address the problem of alcohol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, the Scandinavian countries present us with a difficult problem with their repeated requests for derogations known as “Nordic derogations” regarding the importation of products subject to excise duties, particularly wine and beer. In this way, Sweden enjoys a derogation to this fundamental right, which we prize and which is one of the major rights acquired under the single market, enjoyed by the citizens of the Community, to carry goods bought for their own personal consumption from one point within the Community to another, without having to pay additional taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">This derogation, which concerns alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, was extended until 30 June this year back in 1996, and will, according to the Commission’s proposal, have to be extended once again until 2003. If this were not to be the case, then, in exactly 17 days, European citizens resident in Sweden would find themselves on an equal footing with citizens in the majority of Member States, who can purchase alcohol and tobacco in another Member State up to a value of EUR 175, which is considered a reasonable amount if you have to prove that the goods are for personal use.</p>
<p class="contents">I deplore this new derogation but, inasmuch as Finland and Denmark have been granted derogations until 2003, all we can do is go along with this new derogation granted to Sweden on the basis of the arrangements entered into with Finland. I do so, if I may say, with a heavy heart, because these continued derogations are not calculated – as events show – to solve the problem of alcoholism which these countries use as a reason not to reduce their exorbitant excise duties, particularly on wine and beer. These excise duties are the only reason why their citizens adopt a policy of importing from other Member States in order to achieve what I would call the citizens’ ‘legitimate defence’ against high taxation levels. Your problem, Mr Maaten, will not be solved by abolishing the zero tax rate on wine. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Sweden has a monopoly on importing and a virtual monopoly on distribution, resulting in an price policy which penalises consumers, an area of activity in which Commissioner Monti could well let off some steam more usefully than in the matter of taxes on savings, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters being what they are, I should nonetheless like to ask the Commission the following questions. You base your proposal on Article 93, but you do not say a word about the problem of the harmonisation of excise duties to assist the operation of the single market. Why not? Apparently Commissioner Bolkestein was opposed to extending this derogation. Why have you changed your mind? What expectations do you have of Finland and Sweden in relation to the harmonisation of indirect taxes by 2003? Are you so reticent to intervene with respect to the level of excise duties in Sweden because, by rights, you ought to be making the same recommendations to the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are not covered by derogations, but which also implement a policy of exorbitant excise duties in order to prevent their peoples consuming wine, most of all, but also beer, in moderation, which is scientifically proven to have a preventative effect with regard to diseases which cost a lot in terms of social security.</p>
<p class="contents">I could continue, Madam President, but my speaking time is running out. I shall conclude by saying that the solution to the problem of alcoholism in Scandinavia does not involve derogations to cater for the monopoly, but rather by reducing excise duties, particularly on wine and beer, by abolishing monopolies, and by means of an information and education policy which favours the moderate consumption of wine and beer, to make it beneficial to health and quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, this matter concerns the phasing-out of Sweden’s derogation from the internal market’s rules concerning imports of alcohol and tobacco. It may appear as an insignificant detail, given the number of rules governing the internal market, but Swedish alcohol policy has proved itself to be successful in combating harm caused by alcohol. The policy is founded partly (not solely, but partly) upon high taxes, which entail high consumer prices. It is also founded upon a State monopoly on sales and upon active efforts to protect certain areas, such as road use, from all forms of alcohol consumption. </p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the fact that Sweden belongs to the so-called vodka belt, with its special pattern of consumption, and in spite of the presence of illicit distilling and smuggling, the low overall consumption of alcohol means less overall harm caused by alcohol and lower social costs due to alcohol, if we include everything from accidents on and off the road to alcohol-related illnesses and deaths. </p>
<p class="contents">This policy will, of course, become more difficult to implement without the protection of import restrictions, which is the reason why Sweden has wished either to retain the derogation on a permanent basis or, as the Swedish Government has now agreed with the Commission, at least to be given a number of additional years in which to phase out the derogation. Quite simply, time is needed to prepare new features of alcohol policy which may reduce the risks entailed in the abolition of import restrictions. In the long run, it would probably not, in fact, be possible to isolate Sweden from the rest of Europe in this area. We are now already seeing a lot of private imports from Denmark and Germany, which is likely to increase further now that the Öresund Bridge is being opened and is creating a fixed land link to the European continent and now that the Danish Government is announcing reduced alcohol taxes as a result of competition in Germany. There is also alarming intelligence about illicit distilling, smuggling etc. </p>
<p class="contents">Even if taxes on alcohol are decided at national level, which ought to remain the case, it would probably be impossible, in the long term, to maintain such large differences as there are today in the level of tax between neighbouring countries without this creating problems. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the consequences of the high taxes in Sweden is to create difficulties for Swedish producers and vendors of beer, wine and spirits, as well as for the serious hotel and restaurant trade. Against that background, I see it as indispensable for Sweden now gradually to reduce its taxes on alcohol. It is not certain that there is a need to go right down to those levels which prevail on the European continent, but it will probably become necessary to take a few steps in that direction. In quite a few EU countries, no tax at all is paid on beer and wine, something which is also controversial from a public health point of view. In these countries, these products ought perhaps to be taxed instead. </p>
<p class="contents">I am nonetheless pleased that the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, is taking the problem of public health seriously and does not, like so many others, see alcohol merely as a problem for the internal market. Excessive alcohol consumption is a public health problem to which attention also needs to be paid at European level. For the Scandinavian countries, there is, of course, the risk that a sudden change in the patterns of consumption might lead to many people’s also adopting European patterns of beer and wine consumption on top of the old tradition of schnapps drinking, with serious health problems as a consequence. </p>
<p class="contents">The two forthcoming holders of the presidency, France and Sweden, have indicated that they intend jointly to take up this issue and to propose common public health initiatives which will also deal with the role of alcohol, a development I find gratifying and an important initiative. </p>
<p class="contents">How, then, is the Swedish Government to deal with the problem, now that the borders are gradually being opened so as to permit imports of larger quantities of alcohol than ever before, and at the same time as taxes are likely to be reduced? I believe in a vigorous long-term campaign to provide information, influence attitudes and promote education in schools, within the health care sector and among road users, and I believe especially in the public education carried out by national campaigning organisations etc. All this is necessary and needs to be worked out energetically and with a view to the long term. </p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I therefore agree with the rapporteur’s conclusion to the effect that Parliament ought to approve the agreement between the Swedish Government and the Commission which came about at the request of the ECOFIN ministers. According to this, Sweden should be given time, between now and the end of 2003, to reduce import restrictions to the level which otherwise applies within the internal market. In that way, we should in fact achieve the double aim of, firstly, adapting to the rules of the internal market and, secondly, preventing any harm this might entail by obtaining the time to provide Sweden with a more aggressive alcohol policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Social policy on alcohol springs from a history of serious heavy drinking. For a long time, this policy successfully held its own against influence from outside. That is not the case today. </p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation, an increasingly mobile population and EU membership have caused conditions to change. The current derogation regarding imports of alcohol and tobacco into Sweden was not going to last forever. The new agreement now in the offing between the Swedish Government and the EU would involve a gradual increase in import quotas. This is a good compromise which would give Sweden the opportunity to adapt to the new situation. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maaten has prepared a good report. It is no panegyric to the view that alcohol is merely an agricultural matter, a view expressed in certain parts of Europe. On the contrary, Mr Maaten makes it perfectly clear that alcohol must also begin to be dealt with as a public health issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Sweden’s alcohol policy has led to a situation in which both total consumption and alcohol-related illnesses have been kept at low levels. At the same time, the system, with its monopoly on sales and very high taxes, has been put under heavy pressure in a Europe with open borders. At present, a large proportion of the alcohol consumed in Sweden consists of smuggled and illicitly distilled spirits. Border trade between Sweden and its neighbours is flourishing. </p>
<p class="contents">The increase in import quotas will give Sweden a chance progressively to adjust both its alcohol policy and level of tax in accordance with the policy that is being pursued in other European countries. Lower taxes are required in Sweden, but higher taxes may also perhaps be required in some other EU countries. Sweden cannot conduct an alcohol policy with the aid of border controls and of tax levels higher than those of our neighbours. Now is the time to find new solutions. I believe that what is required is cooperation with other countries, together with a future alcohol policy characterised by a proactive information strategy. What is required is a sensible alcohol policy marked by social responsibility and increased responsibility on the part of the individual. A greater European input is needed in Sweden, but perhaps also a greater Swedish input in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before the referendum on EU membership, the Swedish Government solemnly promised that Swedish alcohol policy would be maintained unaltered. Now, the Social Democratic Government, together with the Left Party and the Moderates, has given an informal promise, as the Commission’s text puts it, to approve the Commission’s proposal gradually to abolish the restrictions on imports of alcohol and tobacco so that these no longer exist by the year 2003. </p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, phasing out the rules on imports means phasing out Swedish alcohol policy. Doing so will, in fact, put a big strain on alcohol policy which is based entirely upon high prices for consumers, that is to say a high tax on alcohol. </p>
<p class="contents">Four parties in the Swedish Parliament oppose the Commission’s and the Government’s line: the Christian Democrats, the Liberals (whom we have just heard speak), the Centre Party and the Greens. These parties are demanding that the Government should stand for, and argue in favour of, keeping the Swedish derogation for as long as the Council has not unanimously taken another decision. </p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important to clarify the EU’s own policy on this question. What ought the Court of Justice of the European Communities to have said? As Mr Maaten is very carefully intimating, this is not merely a question of the internal market but also a health issue. Alcohol and tobacco are the factors which cause, for example, the greatest health problems within the EU, major costs to society and great suffering to individuals. </p>
<p class="contents">Article 152 and Article 95.3 of the Treaties talk of how important it is to have a high level of protection, and Article 30 in actual fact permits restrictions on imports, partly on the grounds of people’s health. </p>
<p class="contents">Sweden has chosen another method, a successful method where alcohol policy is concerned. We have less harm caused by alcohol than most countries in the world, and very low alcohol consumption compared with other EU countries. I do not know whether it is cause for laughter or for tears, but it is certainly worth noting that, as recently as last year, the Member States approved another European action plan for alcohol, prepared by the World Health Organisation. According to this plan, States should impose more tax on alcohol, and there should also be higher minimum taxes on alcohol within the EU. This is recommended as a part of public health strategy. Why dismantle Sweden’s alcohol policy when the EU’s public health strategy points in the same direction with a view to reducing the harm caused by alcohol? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report also indicates that, thanks largely to its responsible alcohol policy, Sweden has a lower level of alcohol consumption and fewer alcohol-related illnesses than other Member States. Sweden’s positive experiences in these areas ought therefore, of course, to be made use of by the EU. Alcohol issues ought to be dealt with in the way that, for example, tobacco and drug issues are now beginning to be dealt with. </p>
<p class="contents">Instead of Sweden’s now being forced to phase out its approach to health policy in order to adapt to the EU, it ought to be the opposite way around: namely, the EU should model its policy on Sweden’s and try to get to grips with the growing alcohol problems. In this area, I should like to see a convergence policy whereby countries with major and growing alcohol problems adopt the much more successful Swedish model. I am therefore going to vote against the Commission’s proposal, recommended by Mr Maaten in a move quite out of keeping with his otherwise excellent report. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by noting that the Swedish Government has now given in to a market imperative able to dispense with the approach focused upon health policy. I hear that many of my fellow MEPs are adopting the same view, namely that Sweden should, for example, give in, even if there are reasons in terms of health policy for taking an entirely different direction. I do not share that view. I think there are good reasons why the EU should reconsider its alcohol policy, and the Swedish experience is important in that context. Therefore, Swedish policy ought not now to be discontinued but, instead, used constructively to the EU’s advantage and benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would argue that excessively high taxes and restrictive monopolies are, in any case, in themselves a bad thing, but they are even worse when camouflaged and justified by the alleged morality of policies protecting the common good.</p>
<p class="contents">But if we examine the data presented, we see that, in proposing to allow this special system to continue for another three years, the rapporteur is clearly saying that 30% of alcoholic drinks consumed in Sweden are produced illegally – which means that they are also sold illegally and that the profits are the profits of crime and mafia activity – and that another 20% is introduced illegally from abroad. This is the situation of alcoholic drink consumption in Sweden!</p>
<p class="contents">However, he tells us that this policy seems to work, for the mortality rate is lower than in other countries, and cites the results of a study carried out by DG-V in October 1998. However, it is a shame that, if we were to examine this study closely, we would find a marginal note, which is not really insignificant, which says that a large number of alcohol-related deaths are not reported as such (hidden population), the real figure being estimated at between 5 000 and 6 000 deaths per year due to alcohol.’<span class="italic"> </span>These figures are over three times as high as the official figures. Let us take care, then! Let us state the figures clearly as they are: the figures demonstrate de facto Prohibition – Prohibition through taxes – a form of Prohibition which, like all Prohibition, fails. </p>
<p class="contents">We have the same problem in Italy with the tobacco monopoly: an entire section of Puglia, the region of Southern Italy which is directly opposite Albania, is overrun with criminal bands which commit murder on a daily basis for the sake of the black market in tobacco. It is the same problem. The figures should be quoted in their entirety and so should documents, especially when one professes to be liberal and comes from an allegedly liberal group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that deadlines are there to be kept to. I think that we should all abide by the same rules in the internal market, and I therefore intend to vote accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Government knew that this derogation was to expire after six months, but all too little has been done to overcome the alcohol abuse which exists. I am particularly concerned about young people’s drinking habits and the easy access to illegal alcohol. Swedish alcohol policy is now in pieces. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, what we have in Sweden is a government which, having yielded to public pressure, has tried to meet the public’s demands for easier access to alcohol. The Swedish alcohol monopoly now opens on Saturdays and at more locations. In many ways, accessibility has also increased due to the larger number of premises serving alcoholic drinks. Above all, however, it is illegal sales of spirits, beer and wine which have increased at the expense of Swedish jobs, tax revenue and supervision. All too little is being done about outright abuse, at the same time as the ordinary drinker has continued to be over-protected and not to have anything like equal rights to import alcohol following visits on holiday to, for example, Denmark or France. </p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about this inability to get to grips with the real problems. Today, perhaps not more than 30<span class="italic"> </span>per cent of sales in Sweden take place via the channels controlled by the politicians. The rest are illegal and may, for example, involve gangland operations, illicit distilling or smuggling by private individuals who, as the politicians see it, are bringing more than their ration into the country. That is why I am saying that Swedish alcohol policy, which involves charging high prices for alcohol and making it difficult to obtain, has foundered. </p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Göran Färm that there has been ample time to do something about this situation. The catalogue of initiatives he mentions should have been embarked upon a long, long time ago. What is more, a lot can be done in the way of providing information and disseminating knowledge. The Swedish Social Democratic Government’s bargaining on this issue shows, however, that there has been no concern about, or belief in, people. Instead, it is only the tax base to which close attention has been given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What makes imports of alcohol into more of a trade issue than a public health issue? In the 1994 referendum on Swedish membership of the EU, Swedish citizens were told that the derogations could be extended beyond the year 2000. The temperance movement and many citizens, including myself, were satisfied with that. </p>
<p class="contents">On 13 March of this year, Mr Guterres, Prime Minister of Portugal (the country currently holding the Presidency of the Union) described the EU’s cultural diversity as a form of wealth. He talked of there not being a single, general opinion, but 15 different arenas. Through the Commissioner responsible, Mr Bolkestein, the European Union should now nonetheless normalise the conditions which enable the Member States to continue to pursue national, democratically determined alcohol policies. Mr Bolkestein and the Commission maintain that the internal market functions in such a way as to require that every citizen be given the so-called right day in and day out to bring 210 litres of alcohol across national borders. For a family with three older children, this corresponds to 7 metric tons of alcohol per week. Should that be a so-called right? Is that a level consistent with moderate consumption? There is no question of Sweden’s being a nanny State. It is about a one-nation mentality and of taking the issue of alcohol and drug abuse seriously in terms of an integrated view of society. </p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this issue and of the disquiet felt during Euro 2000 on the subjects of hooliganism and alcohol abuse, the Commission’s decision and the actions of Sweden’s Social Democratic Government appear absurd to say the least. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Maaten. The Commission proposal reflects the compromise which has been reached between Sweden and the Commission regarding prolonging the possibility of applying restrictions to products subject to excise duties which may be brought into Sweden by travellers from other Member States. This arrangement would normally have expired at the end of this month. Sweden has requested more time to adapt its alcohol policy. This has also been stressed by Mr Färm who said that we need time to adapt our policy. Well, the European Commission is prepared to give Sweden until the end of the year 2003 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the compromise which has been reached is fair and reasonable. It guarantees that the restrictions for travellers will disappear once and for all by the end of the year 2003, as I have already mentioned. But at the same time, it provides for a short, further period of adjustment. The gradual liberalisation during the transitional period underlines Sweden’s commitment to finally do away with derogations and will ensure that Swedish citizens will finally be able to benefit from the unified market in the same way as other EU citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted that Mr Maaten’s report supports the Commission proposal. But the Commission cannot accept the tabled amendments, although it very much understands the reasons which have led to their tabling. The Commission is of the opinion that it is not advisable to make reference to general issues, such as the connection between alcohol policy and health policy or the need to aim for more coordination of excise levels on alcohol, within the context of a proposal on derogations applied by one Member State. These derogations from fundamental principles of the internal market have been granted in order to allow Sweden to adapt its alcohol policy. As such, – and I would also address Mr Sacrédeus here – we are dealing here with fundamental principles of the common internal market. </p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the justification was for Sweden enjoying this derogation since joining the Community – and if I could once again address Mr Sacrédeus – as far as I can remember, no exceptions which were to apply forever were made at the time. The derogation was supposed to lapse at the end of this month, and this has always been provided for. But as I have said before, Sweden was granted a few more years to adapt its alcohol policy. But – once again – this exception was certainly not meant to last forever. I repeat: whatever the justification was for this derogation, the Commission is of the opinion that the transitional period will have been sufficiently long, namely nine years from Sweden’s accession to the EU until the end of 2003, and that it is now time to establish a definite expiry date for this derogation from the principles of the free movement of goods and persons. </p>
<p class="contents">Maybe you will allow me, by way of concluding, to address a few points which have been raised by Members of Parliament this evening. I would especially like to stress once again that the public health aspect which Mr Maaten mentioned is, of course, important. All countries, all EU Member States have alcohol-related problems, and know about alcohol-related problems, and all EU Member States are adopting an anti-alcohol policy. It is only natural and very sensible that Sweden should do the same, but this should be possible without prejudicing the rules for the free movement of goods which, as has been mentioned before, is one of the European Union’s cornerstones. </p>
<p class="contents">So once again, it is very understandable that that health policy is pursued in Sweden. Mr Färm and Mrs Carlsson have already clarified the way in which it should be pursued. It is important to take measures in the form of information campaigns, information in schools and vis-� -vis the public, as happens elsewhere in the Community. This is the first point which I wanted to raise. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the harmonisation of excise duty on alcohol products. Could I inform you that, as the Members of this House are aware, the Commission does not have any instruments at its disposal to impose a specific excise policy? The Commission might wish it had, but it has not. What the Commission can do, however, is to ensure that the minimum tariff, which is the only rule which pertains to the whole of the European Union, is maintained. Furthermore, the Commission will, as it is required to do, be drawing up a report either at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year which will outline the state of affairs within the EU with regard to excise. This report will thus be available around the beginning of next year, and the Commission will naturally make some recommendations in this report because, after all, the huge discrepancies in excise levels between Member States lead to distortions within the internal market, something which the Commission does not like to see. So the report will contain recommendations, but the Commission does not have instruments at its disposal. </p>
<p class="contents">I would recommend Parliament to adopt Mr Maaten’s report without amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
