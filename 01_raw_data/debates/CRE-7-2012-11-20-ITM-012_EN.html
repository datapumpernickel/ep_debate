<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, in the last few months a number of restructuring processes have been announced in many industrial sectors in various Member States. 274 cases of restructuring were registered in the third quarter of 2012, according to the latest data from the European Restructuring Monitor. These cases amount to a net job loss of more than 74 000, thus showing a reversed situation compared to the pre-crisis one, which saw the net creation of 6 600 jobs in the third quarter of 2007 for the same number of restructuring cases.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures reflect the current difficult macro-economic situation linked to the sovereign debt crisis but probably also a structural change in the European economy and labour market. This requires clear policy action. More than ever, good anticipation of change and responsible management of restructuring is crucial. If not managed properly, restructuring operations can have negative consequences for the economy of the surrounding area, incur high social costs across regions and negatively affect workers and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is particularly worrying in the automotive sector, where major restructuring operations have been announced in recent months. There is a significant risk that more such announcements will be made in the coming months. The latest announcements concern PSA and Ford. PSA has announced its intention to close its plant in Aulnay-sous-Bois and to restructure the plant in Rennes. Ford has announced its intention to close its plant in Genk in Belgium as well as the plants in Southampton and Dagenham in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The total amount, including indirect job losses in the supply chain, could be as much as 22 000 job losses. Moreover, announcements were also made by General Motors, Volvo and, in the supply chain, by Faurecia. While the difficulties of the automotive industry are linked to the situation on European markets, it has to be noted that the industry also suffers from long-standing structural overcapacities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to help Member States and all stakeholders to mobilise instruments and policies that can help the sector to restructure and build a sustainable future. Most urgently, the Commission wants to explore all possibilities to support workers affected by restructuring or likely to be affected in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already spelled out in detail its strategy for the automotive sector in the CARS 2020 Action Plan, adopted on 8 November 2012. In this strategic document, the Commission announces how it intends to conduct its policies supporting the sector in many different policy fields: research, development and innovation, trade policy, a better functioning internal market, investment in human capital and the anticipation of change and restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is to boost the competitiveness of the industry. Some actions will thus produce effects in the longer term; others, however, can be implemented already. The Competitiveness Council of 10 December 2012 will focus discussions on these, with a view also to minimising the social and economic consequences of announced restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of anticipation of change, the Commission will support the creation of a European Automotive Skills Council, which will bring together existing national organisations conducting research on skills and employment in the automotive sector. The Commission will also support the creation of a social dialogue committee that should bring together manufacturers and suppliers representing workers and employers at the joint request of all interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to overcapacity and restructuring, it has to be stressed that this is mainly the responsibility of the industry, but the Commission also has a role to play. First of all, the Commission will monitor restructuring activities to ensure their strict compliance with EU legislation, in particular concerning state aid and internal market rules. The Commission also expects each individual company to comply with the rules established in the directives on information and consultation and on collective redundancies, as well as with any existing company agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission will make all possible efforts to minimise the negative social effect of restructuring, which is the core of the Commission’s message today. For that purpose, the Commission will encourage the use of the European Social Fund for retraining and re-skilling of workers in the new financial perspective of the Structural Funds. The Commission will also encourage the Member States to use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the EGF. It is important to note that the automotive sector is already the sector with the highest number of EGF cases – namely 16 – and that almost 21 000 automotive workers have been allocated EGF assistance worth a total of EUR 113 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it would be more important then ever to keep a reinforced EGF in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) after 2014. This is far from being guaranteed and I count on your support in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure policy consistency, the Commission will consider re-launching the inter-service restructuring Task Force, which will bring together the Member States, regional authorities, industry and the social partners to study and follow up the main cases of automotive plant closures or significant downsizing. The Task Force would streamline the use of the relevant EU Funds by providing technical assistance, reducing waiting time, advising on the most effective use of resources, monitoring and reporting.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, for each region affected by a plant closure or a significant downsizing, the Commission will advise, facilitate and liaise with a partnership of regional stakeholders, led by local authorities who would pool the resources available and prepare a complete package of measures such as measures for workers made redundant, support for reconversion of suppliers, community support, measures to develop technology, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to benefit from existing experiences, the Commission also wants to identify good practices and promote an anticipative approach in restructuring, in consultation with representatives of the automotive-intensive regions, employment authorities and the sector’s stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the Commission will encourage Member States to make use of labour flexibility schemes and ESF cofinancing to support suppliers who may need additional time to find new clients following the closure or downsizing of an automotive plant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are of course aware of these aspects but today we are assuming rather too easily that we at European level or you as the European Commission can do absolutely nothing about it. You speak about monitoring the implementation of European legislation but today the situation is such that multinationals like Opel, General Motors or Ford just play off the different national subsidy systems against each other or look to see where they can produce the cheapest for the lowest social costs and then simply move their production to that place.</p>
<p class="contents">That is actually the ultimate misunderstanding of the defective functioning of the European internal market when companies delocalise on the basis of the scope of the national market and that can of course not be the intention. It also illustrates in a particularly painful way, Commissioner, the appalling lack of minimum social agreements within Europe. May I refer to Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It provides specifically for the possibility of the European Commission making proposals in order to ensure the balanced progress of the internal market and we should be able to avail ourselves of that article perfectly to support such restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two more points, Commissioner; first of all the new CARS 2020 Action Plan, which you mentioned, refers specifically to measures provided to support suppliers who are affected by the closure of a car factory. It is very important that suppliers can call upon bridging measures in order to be able to look for new customers. Are you ready to do something about it in the short term?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, a quick word about the European Investment Bank: it must stop granting advantageous loans to large companies, large car manufacturers that then use these subsidies to produce elsewhere outside the European Union and to delocalise. That can obviously not be the intention. It is naive, it is unacceptable and it must stop. Can we also expect action from you in that regard? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without more Europeanisation of national strategies, particularly in terms of job protection, the current crisis will not be resolved and there will be no economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The automotive crisis is not just about overcapacity: it is about widespread job losses. The crisis now seems to be structural and concerns the very future of the automotive sector as we know it today. We want to have an automotive industry in Europe and do not want to squander the skills, know-how and professional expertise that exist. We are therefore calling for a major restructuring and regeneration project to be launched swiftly so that the costs do not escalate disproportionately.</p>
<p class="contents">Restructuring cannot only derive from fragmented decisions by national governments and individual companies. We at least need to try to join forces and guide this painful process at EU level, making the interested parties sit down at the table for a dialogue between the social partners, manufacturers, trade unions and governments in each country, offering support for research, innovation, training, upskilling and the necessary funding. I know that this will be an arduous task, because the national interests of individual companies are not the same. However, since competition within the European Union is highly ambiguous and at times risks being unfair, I believe that ultimately it is in the interests of all countries to have effective EU guidance and stimulus, so that together we can face the increasingly aggressive global market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, we have to consider the impact on the industry itself and on the economies in the various Member States, but equally we need to look at the social impact of all of this – the impact on workers, the impact on their families and on their communities. There is no doubt that this situation has been looming for a long time, with declining domestic demand and of course overcapacity in the industry, and it certainly is questionable whether adequate measures have been taken by Member States to anticipate the structural change that is now taking place in Europe. I certainly look forward to the Commission’s proposals in this area. I would welcome the setting up of an Automotive Skills Council and the social dialogue as outlined by Commissioner Andor.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am particularly concerned with the social impact. The current recession in the EU, coupled with the austerity measures and indeed slow growth globally, paints a pretty dismal picture for many of the workers who will be made redundant. I believe that, in this context, we need to ensure a European response to the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We do have a number of suitable instruments at our disposal, including one mentioned by the Commissioner himself – the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). That Fund was put in place to deal with large-scale redundancies due to globalisation and, in my view, it could provide a significant European response to the situation. The EGF can support Member States in retraining and upskilling workers, and indeed it can assist workers in setting up their own businesses or in accessing opportunities to change their career path. The EGF is important for all Member States – indeed 21 Member States have already accessed it – but it is particularly important for those Member States which are cutting back on expenditure and investment at this point in time, because it can give real assistance and help in funding the retraining and the upskilling of redundant workers.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we have a blocking minority in Council on the EGF, yet I believe that as an instrument it would be of real assistance in this situation. I am once again calling on Member States to review their opposition to this Fund and look at it as another policy tool available to their redundant workers. It will not solve all their problems, but it can be an important part of the policy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with Mr Belet that we need a coherent industrial policy in regard to the location of industry and the harmonisation of social standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That can of course at the very most be just the beginning of an answer to the problems in the motor industry. Yes, we must invest in advanced technologies and in clean vehicles. Yes, improved market conditions and financial stimuli are necessary for the environment. Yes, better market access is necessary. Yes, training of older and younger workers is necessary and the European Social Fund must be used, but all of that is naturally not a response to the specific social disasters that the employees of Ford Genk, the staff in Southampton and the workers in Rennes are now facing.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that the car giants set Member States against each other on the principle that ‘one man’s meat is another man’s poison’. The reality is that ordinary employees are laid off or are forced to sacrifice pay while CEOs are richly rewarded with salaries and bonuses in the millions. The reality is that when a company closure is announced, share prices rise. The reality is that the car giants invest far too little in innovation, people and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have mentioned a whole toolbox of possible measures, but you have actually been really vague. Can you say specifically here that in all the regions affected you will support very specific initiatives that will lead to a change? Can you promise that you and your departments will do everything possible to assure the tens of thousands of employees at Ford, PSA and Volvo, who will probably soon be unemployed, that they will once again have some sort of job prospects thanks to political action being taken?

From my perspective, having been in that industry for 30 years, I feel the situation we are facing is amongst the worst, because sales demand has dropped off so much and shows no sign of immediate recovery. The Commission has made a very realistic assessment and has talked about the key tools that need to be put in place to help in the restructuring which many Members are calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to the future for the automotive industry in Europe – and we want a really strong and globally competitive automotive industry – is going to be investment in new technologies and new products. That is a core part of the 2020 proposal, but in the meantime we have to help those employees who are affected by plant closures. I have been through that where I live. We have had two major plant closures in the last ten years. We have done the things that the Commissioner talked about: we have pulled local authorities together, we have used European funds and we have looked for ways to retrain and reassign people into manufacturing or service businesses in order to redevelop jobs in those economies. We have the knowledge, ladies and gentlemen; it is there for you to use. Please come and talk about it. This is not a new situation, and it is essential that we deal with it in the way we are talking about if we are to have a really strong, long-term future for a crucial industry.</p>

The point I was making, and I think Mr Andor was very realistic, is that the funding we need to put in is to help those employees affected by what are inevitable plant closures. The Ford Company according to their own figures – and you can check them – is going to lose EUR 1.6 billion this year in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Mr Staes was talking about the fact the he felt that the management of Ford could make sacrifices and stop closing plants. I am afraid if you are losing EUR 1.6 billion, colleagues, you have to do something about it. I think Ford are right in restructuring production because they want to invest in new models. That is the reality of where we are. We are supporting research and development and we also need to deploy the instruments which Mr Andor was talking about to help people back into new jobs. That, I think, is something that we all agree upon.</p>

We need strong partners in Europe. We need investors in Europe. That is why I made the point I did. We are not here to question their wisdom in how much they pay their chief executive globally, because Ford is a global business with plants all over the world. We have to decide what should happen and what is realistic in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My point is that the priority is to help the people affected, and not to make criticisms about salaries which are not actually going to help solve the problem. We should be helping people and showing them that we are going to help solve their problems and that we understand the agonies of plant closures. I have been there.

In Italy, for example, Fiat’s chief executive is misleading the public, and more importantly Fiat’s employees, by saying, ‘Don’t worry, our new products will be sold on the US market’, when everyone knows very well that the US market has no need for more imports; it is quite capable of meeting its future production requirements, even though it seems to have its own problems which are very different from Europe’s.</p>

We should therefore be able to expect that the Member States and also the European Union will do their utmost to assist the motor industry, for example, against competition from outside the European Union that does not have to obey the same rules. Yet nothing is further from the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank granted Ford a cheap loan of EUR 100 million to start up a factory in Kocaeli in Turkey. Some sources even speak of an amount of EUR 190 million that was loaned to Ford in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the European Union is actively financing and supporting the delocalisation of companies out of Europe, such as Ford Genk. Turkey also receives billions from the Commission in so-called pre-accession funding. It was therefore to be expected that part of all that money would also be used to take industrial activity away from Europe and move it to countries like Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">How on earth has it come to this? How can you explain it to the 10 000 people in Limburg who are losing their jobs and the thousands of others in Southampton and Dagenham, for example? Are there still cases where the Investment Bank or the Commission finances factories in low-wage countries or relatively low-wage countries whereby unfair competition arises against companies in Europe? Can the Commission be more specific about the question of which funds from the Globalisation Fund can be used to reintegrate workers made redundant in Genk, for example, into the labour market and to support them? It is now time to start coming up with specific answers to these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis has taught us one thing and reminded us of a truth: that the industry is extremely important for the robustness of Europe’s economy, and the car industry is important for Europe’s industrial basis. It creates jobs not only in countries where cars are assembled, but also through the supply chain in all Member States. For instance, no car comes off a production line in Germany today without it containing, for example, parts manufactured in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the car industry is in global competition. It is a global industry which faces strong global competition, and a European or national policy can support or kill off this industry’s competitiveness. If we look, we will see that there is no Member State in the European Union which is similar to another Member State in terms of the tax regime for pollution, car registration taxes and so on, and these differences are obstacles to the development of the European car industry, obstacles in the single market. Is there nothing we can do to harmonise things a little, to eliminate these differences? In the United States, as in other countries, governments have given substantial aid to the car industry in order to innovate and switch to cars with lower carbon dioxide emissions. We need to do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons then was the closure of Opel in Antwerp. At that time I was absolutely furious. First of all I was angry because so many people were losing their jobs and because of the huge impact of this on their families, but I was also angry because the Commission did not take action at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, a good two years later, nothing has actually changed. The Commission has still not taken any action and is to a certain extent hiding behind a number of competences that it may or may not have. Commissioner, the Commission can do many things. Let me mention three things in respect of which I really expect the Commission to act now.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, when restructuring it is perfectly possible for the Commission to intervene, and at the very least speak to the multinationals and ensure that the various companies and establishments are not set against each other. Secondly, please let us make further efforts to ensure that in the future as well industry is still possible in Europe – because if we do not pay attention then a number of American multinationals will gradually pull out and establish themselves on the periphery of Europe. Thirdly – and the Ford employees in Genk are really furious about this – how on earth is it possible that we are using funds from the European Investment Bank to modernise a company outside the European Union in Turkey, in such a way that further delocalisation is possible?</p>

In the community of which I shall be mayor from January, more than 700 families are affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Flemish government and the Limburg provincial authorities are working together on a plan for the future. That is excellent, but the question is: where is Europe in all this? What is Europe doing for this region? I think Europe cannot just sit and watch. With one stroke of the pen a multinational actually moves a whole factory from one European region to another, while it made a promise (only a few months ago) and it was a robust promise, on paper, regarding the future of this factory! It is clearly no longer worth the paper it is written on.</p>
<p class="contents">You have mentioned a number of specific measures, but I have a question for you about the Cohesion Fund. Limburg as a region needs special help, in view of the exceptional circumstances, and there are precedents: for example, Bavaria obtained an additional EUR 75 million under the current cohesion programme. Can Limburg also count on such assistance and will the Commission indicate that similar action will be taken in the short term? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the commercial decisions taken by companies at this time amid car industry woes across the European Union, across the world, may be something which car companies can put up with, but not the people working in them. We understand of course that there is overcapacity, maybe, but promises made are not promises to be broken easily either. I represent the area of Southampton Swaythling plant, which is the assembly for the Ford Transit Van which is now to be scrapped. This will have a major impact upon that community.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say that I join with my colleagues around the Chamber about the transfer of funds – EUR 100 million – for the Ford Otosan plant in Turkey. Perhaps we should ask some questions about this. After all, I know it is not public funds, but let us ask this question. There are certain people who have been involved in this, the Commission itself offers an opinion about whether or not these funds should be transferred and so do Member States. Are we that naïve that we do not believe that such a neighbourhood policy where we give funds to countries just outside the EU will not eventually lead to job transfers? Are we that silly that we do not actually wake up and realise this is going to occur? We really need to ask a question about what the remit of the EIB is in this particular issue and get down to talking about what they should and should not be allowed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just looking at the sight across the way from me where there are empty benches where UKIP sit, who also represent my area, it tells me very well that wrapping yourself in your national flag does nothing to protect you against global crises either and it is a shame they cannot be here to join this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No, I believe we need to examine how corporate policy can be shaped in a sensible way. The lesson is firstly that we need different forms of corporate governance. We need employees to be more involved in their companies so that sensible solutions can be found for the future of firms. This is one of the central lessons learned from the crisis: greater worker participation in companies to enable sensible solutions to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner, we in fact have 15 factories in the European Union that are running at around 50 % capacity. When I look at the global market, however, Commissioner, car production is growing from roughly 79 million to 84 million. Something is wrong here! It is unacceptable that we are de-industrialising here, while, on the other hand, the global automotive market is growing by 3 % a year.</p>
<p class="contents">No, we do not need to just close down car factories, we need investments in future technologies to ensure that the automotive industry remains in Europe and is competitive on the global market. This also means that global corporations must be urged to exercise restraint, as they also make global investment decisions and do not necessarily place a particular emphasis on European interests.

Finally we have some sort of industrial policy. At least the warning lights are now flashing in response to the crisis that can occur in the automotive industry and that is on the table today following the dramatic announcements of the closure of Ford factories in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, however, there will be more, and what we have on the table is a clear awareness that we are lacking in European instruments; that we cannot respond to this crisis country by country and by placing countries and workers in opposition to each other; that we need a truly European instrument that anticipates and prepares for technological change, globalisation and the crisis that we are suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not allow the same situation to occur as occurred with the financial industry: that we come in afterwards with solutions but are not able to make proactive policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see, Commissioner, that in the Communication you are finally beginning to talk about anticipation. You are already aware that yesterday the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted an own-initiative report in order for there to be a legislative act by the Commission, a real legislative act that creates guidelines at European level and European standards for responsibly managing restructuring and change, and that prioritises the participation of workers, information, anticipation, training and assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, Commissioner, let us forget about this idea of this only being an issue for businesses. It is indeed an issue for businesses, but it is also an issue for workers, the regions, the Member States and Europe, whose future is at stake: its future in the world order.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need more Europe, more solidarity, more instruments, and to face up to the situation, as the US has done, for example.

The car industry therefore represents a percentage of these mobilisations, and has done so for some years. The time has come for the Commission to decide to take action in this sector, which is in difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the crisis the only cause of difficulties in the car sector? Have not poor management choices been made by certain companies? Could one not have foreseen the situation, realigned earlier and developed a comparative advantage on the market?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion – and I agree with Alejandro – anticipation of restructuring is a necessity. Why not make the Globalisation Adjustment Fund a European tool for anticipating restructuring? The United States has a far-reaching fund and does not hesitate to use it to realign industries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to introduce the concept of anticipation in the revision of the regulation, but so far without success. I believe that this new focus of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund could appeal to the Member States, and I wonder what support the Commission could provide to such an initiative for the revision of this Fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why eight days ago I received a delegation of the trade unions of this company and discussed with representatives of the employees themselves what the Commission can do in this particular situation, particularly by using the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, but also in the broader context in cooperation with the authorities of Belgium, also using the European Social Fund if allocations are available.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also want to stress that similarly to many who have spoken in this debate, I consider the question of the industry to be extremely serious and very relevant. That is why, together with Mr Tajani, we have been working on a reinforced industrial policy for the European Union which sets out a very concrete numerical objective until 2020: to reverse the industrial decline of Europe, to increase the share of industry within the European economy to at least 20 % of the European GDP from its current level of 16%.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course this requires a very concerted effort. It also requires a sectoral view when necessary and when justified and clearly the automotive sector is one of those where we need a concrete sectoral focus and an action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact the CARS 2020 Action Plan delivers. It delivers many requirements which you mentioned in this discussion. For example, in terms of innovation, it does not lower but actually increases the ambition. It also points to the possible financing tools by which the European Union can help the revival of this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as Mr Harbour also pointed out, there is a need for a certain level of realism, a need to see what globalisation, global competition, cost-effectiveness means in this sector, what skills are needed in the future; and that is why the anticipation of change, the anticipation of structural development in cooperation with the social partners involved is so important in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This is actually one of the key lessons of our consultation, on the basis of the Commission Green Paper, on restructuring which we conducted in the first half of this year; and on the basis of this consultation, which included a broader range of stakeholders and not only the social partners, we are very carefully considering the necessary steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In that of course we pay very close attention to the work of Mr Cercas as rapporteur and certainly we will consider his conclusions, which I believe are forthcoming in December in this Parliament, when we decide in the Commission on the necessary steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly take note of many points made in this debate concerning the wish for a more robust, more interventionist industrial policy. I have to admit that what is there, a 2.0 industrial policy – it has been reinforced as compared to the original version in the Europe 2020 strategy, it does a lot more in terms of innovation, in terms of human capital, in terms of access to markets, access to finance – is certainly not exactly the same type of planned economy which I heard from some of the interventions. We definitely cannot establish a planned economy retroactively and give a capacity to the European Commission to come with concrete intervention potential to cases when some of these companies, multinationals, decide to relocate.</p>
<p class="contents">But I share your view when you say that these industrial policies should be better coordinated with the development of our financial institutions, including the European Investment Bank. Indeed, not only the Ford case but some other cases are controversial and we need to look into the decisions of the EIB and see, especially in the context of the capital increase which the Commission also has advocated in the case of the EIB; without, of course, interfering too much with the business plan of the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">But I think this would be justified if there is an effort in Europe to increase the financial capacity of the EIB. There should also be a discussion of how the EIB could refocus its financing actually on the European Member States and coordinate these projects better with the need to revive European manufacturing and in particular to help the relatively weaker regions.</p>
<p class="contents">That also brings me to the questions of the MFF because several speakers, including the rapporteur, Miss Harkin, but also Mr Daerden, mentioned the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is indeed our key instrument for intervention in such cases. It is an ex post instrument, once restructuring has already been announced. But it is also an ex ante instrument because, through training, through various forms of education, promoting enterprise, it can actually prepare many workers involved for future economic or business activities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a capacity, a merit, a potential in the EGF which I hope those in the European Council will appreciate later this week when they consider the social dimension of the MFF and the instruments that can support workers who are very often the victims of careless industrial decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this has been an extremely important discussion. I would like to connect it to the morning’s discussion when we were together here with Vice-President Tajani to discuss the questions of industry and what the Commission can do for what the Vice-President calls an industrial revolution in the European Union, and I will certainly share with my colleagues the points and lessons of this debate, especially on the question of restructuring. I agree with many of you that we have a lot to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We definitely need some form of restructuring since European societies are facing new challenges in the wake of the economic crisis. I would like to emphasise that Hungary plays a leading role in this respect, where Mercedes and Audi investments have created numerous new jobs supplemented by infrastructure developments that are of use to everyone.
