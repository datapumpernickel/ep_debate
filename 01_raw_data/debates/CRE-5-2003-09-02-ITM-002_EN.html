<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, on behalf of Mrs de Palacio, who is, owing to exceptional circumstances, obliged to be absent from Strasbourg and has asked me to stand in for her with regard to Mr Schmitt’s report, I should like to give you the Commission’s point of view on this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the negotiation and implementation of air service agreements between Member States and third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 2002, the Court of Justice of the European Communities issued a historic judgment on international air transport. This proposal forms an essential part of the follow-up to that judgment. In eight cases, involving different Member States and brought before the Court of Justice by the Commission, the Court ruled that the Community has jurisdiction in many matters concerning air transport. The Court ruled that the Member States had acted illegally by negotiating and concluding bilateral agreements independently. Insofar as the Community and the Member States currently have shared competency regarding air transport, it is up to the Community to take the initiative in international negotiations, and that is normal practice. That being the case, there is a practical problem. Member States have between them probably concluded around 2 000 bilateral agreements. The Commission cannot take on the responsibility of managing all of them. It is therefore necessary to find a way of now giving the Member States the authorisation to continue some of their negotiations within an acceptable legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal now before Parliament was designed to enable Member States to carry out that task. The idea is very simple. Member States will have to inform the Commission and the other Member States of any negotiations being planned, which will enable the Commission to verify that they comply with the measures laid down in Community law and to define, where appropriate, any common interests. The other Member States will also be able to identify any common difficulties. Then, once the negotiations have been completed, the Member States will have to notify the Commission of the results, and the Commission will authorise the concluding of the agreement if it complies with Community law and with the Community’s transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this system, the proposal also obliges Member States not to discriminate so as to guarantee equal treatment for all the airlines of the Community and avoid a situation in which Member States give preference to their own national airlines. The Court of Justice has clearly indicated that all the airlines established in a Member State should benefit from fair treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects which need to be taken into consideration when we examine this proposal. In accordance with current practice, international negotiations on air transport must be conducted at Community level. This proposal constitutes a special and unusual authorisation which recognises existing bilateral precedents in air transport. It provides a balance between compliance with Community law and the establishing of a practical system. Bearing in mind the special nature of this authorisation, it is essential that the activities of Member States should be subject to systematic control before and after the negotiations, so as to avoid any abuse of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council has examined this proposal and, subject to a few improvements or amendments, it approves it in principle. In particular it has approved the idea of the prior notification of negotiations, as I mentioned just now, and of the subsequent approval of the results of those negotiations. Member States have asked for flexibility so as to be able to negotiate with their bilateral partners. As for the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it welcomes the favourable response given by the Council to its proposal, and it hopes that the various stages leading towards the final adoption of that proposal will be completed rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the above considerations, I would ask you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to observe the progress of the action which we have proposed and which I have had this opportunity of describing to you on behalf of Mrs de Palacio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmitt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are actually debating a regulation on the negotiation and conclusion of air service agreements. This heralds the end of a dispute that has exercised the Commission and the Member States for years, a dispute which unfortunately was not resolved politically at a time when this would still have made sense, but which finally had to be as it were set aside by virtue of a ruling of the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, the Member States continued to conclude bilateral air service agreements, which led to the internal market – which we had already made a reality in 1992 – being annulled in the air transport sector, ultimately reducing and restricting the opportunities and possibilities open to the Member States' airlines. It is therefore logical – and I fully agree with this – for our finally to have a Community agreement between the European Union and the United States, so that, competing as a European continent, we can use the opportunities that the USA has already been using for years in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not quite follow the Commission's comments and have also made this clear in my report: the Commission referred, no doubt partly out of annoyance and partly out of frustration after years of trying to persuade the Council to give it a negotiating mandate, to illegality, and in so doing it may now have thrown the baby out with the bathwater! If Commissioner Barnier said that the Council had already more or less accepted that in the future Member States would have to present the results of their bilateral negotiations for approval, then I think we are a long way from what we have discussed so intensively in the past and have also written in the Constitutional Treaty, namely from the principle of subsidiarity. Even allowing for the annoyance and the exuberance, I certainly cannot go along with the Commission's approach here, that it is now trying to treat the Member States like small children in what is after all an important issue for the national airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not disputing the fact that in the future the Community will have to lead the negotiations in certain areas, that is right and proper, not least because of the equivalence that needs to be established. As you rightly pointed out, however, there are over 2000 national bilateral air service agreements and these air service agreements will have to be developed further, they will have to be maintained and new ones will have to be added to their number. I think it is right and proper, where there is no obligation and no need for a Community agreement, to leave these in the sovereignty of the Member States. That these national agreements obviously have to be in accordance with Community law is, as I see it, not in question, but it is unacceptable for the spontaneity and sovereignty of the Member States to be restricted in such a way that, for each agreement, they not only, as it were, have to report that the negotiations have started, but also present the results and have them approved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say again very clearly that I have tried to put this in a slightly different way in my report, and I have not gone along with the Commission's proposal, which has been made once again clearly by Commissioner Barnier. I think that the Commission should restrict itself to those areas where there is a need for the Community to negotiate, and that otherwise the Member States should continue to have the right to negotiate, obviously subject to Community law and the Commission's right, if need be, to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident, when I say a dispute is drawing to an end, that at the latest at the second reading a solution will be found that is acceptable to the Council, the Commission and Parliament. Until recently talks were still being held to achieve this, because there is a willingness on all sides to give a little more ground. The Member States are prepared to accept committing themselves to incorporating certain standard clauses in future air service agreements, and I therefore think that we will be able, despite our still differing starting positions, to settle this in good time to the mutual satisfaction of all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address one final point, because of course next we will be moving straight on to the vote, and that is Amendment No 17. This amendment, which unfortunately – and I use the word advisedly – received majority support in the committee, states that the 'polluter pays' principle should play a role in future agreements. I wish to point out once more that the negotiation of air service agreements is concerned exclusively with which traffic rights are retained and which can be used and I have absolutely no idea what the 'polluter pays' principle is doing in an air service agreement about these traffic rights. Obviously we can write a great deal in regulations, but anything that does not belong there should be taken out again, because it is irrelevant in this context. That is why I would earnestly request that when the time comes you do not vote in favour of Amendment No 17.</p>

If I understood Mr Barnier correctly, he has also swung a little in the direction of the rapporteur, because originally it was still the case that the Commission wanted to say: the Member States will have to terminate all of their air service agreements and we will make new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">If I understood Mr Barnier correctly, he is falling in with our line, because there are two things that we need to consider: we need to implement the ECJ ruling, and underlying that is also that we need to create fair conditions of competition for our European airlines in relation to third countries. That is an important task. But we also need to bear in mind that the airlines need legal certainty. They need legal certainty in their air service agreements with the countries of the world, and that is why we cannot terminate everything and say that we will stay in a state of flux. Instead we first need to restrict ourselves to those things for which the Commission has the manpower. That is why, Mr Barnier, it is right for you also to take the path that the rapporteur has proposed, and proceed on a step-by-step basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important agreement is the agreement with the USA. We want a transatlantic market in air transport with reasonable access rules and reasonable competition rules, and I hope that the Commissioner for transport will brief us very soon in the committee on the extent to which preparations for the negotiations with the USA are already in hand and when negotiations will start. I think that from an economic point of view this is the most important agreement for all of our airlines, whether it be Air France, British Airways or Lufthansa, which is why we need to find a reasonable settlement, and it is also of great significance for competition between them. I therefore hope that we will make speedy progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">Once we have produced such a model for an open, fair airspace with the USA, we will have to ensure, as the rapporteur said, that we apply it to those countries that either already have a similarly liberalised market or are striving to create one.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say in closing that, irrespective of this, we also urgently need to talk to Russia, because the Russian conditions for our airlines are fundamentally such that we cannot accept them. We should therefore proceed cautiously, start with the USA, but not lose sight of Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The basis of the discussion that we have had so far is the importance of these bilateral agreements within the aviation sector. Quite rightly the issue of the United States is being singled out as probably the more important one. But I would not like us to become obsessed with an agreement with the United States to the detriment of an agreement with the other third countries. Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Japan are all waiting for agreements. So whilst it is important that we stress the importance of the United States agreement, we should remember that this is a report about relations with other countries, not just the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is that the United States will see this as a golden opportunity to cherry-pick, as they have always done, the best routes into Europe. It is what the Americans call 'an early harvest', where they get all the goodies and we in the European Union are left with the crumbs off the master's table. That is why it is important that we have a report that prevents this happening.</p>
<p class="contents">We have some concerns with a number of the amendments that have been passed, in particular Amendment No 16, which deletes Article 4. We also have problems with Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 14. We agree with Mr Schmitt with regard to Amendment No 17, but this is what happens when you allow the Green Group to hijack transport reports as they have a habit of trying to do. The 'polluter pays' principle is an important one, but it is not the right approach to a technical decision that comes out of a European Court judgement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say on a personal note, that whilst my group will be supporting Amendment No 4, both the British delegation and I have difficulty in supporting it. With those provisions that I have outlined, we will support Mr Schmitt's report, but we have reservations on those six amendments and in particular Amendment No 16. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In principle, I think that it is important for us to only regulate on a European level things that actually have added value. These are things that we really need to organise properly in a European context. I am therefore very critical of the turn of phrase Mr Schmitt has chosen, and with the direction of this report, which is, I think, doing too much damage to the authority recently obtained by the European Commission with the intervention of the European Court. I myself would like to see the Commission have ample authority in this area in order to ensure that all bilateral aviation agreements between the EU and third countries are concluded according to the same principle. This would prevent the unnatural fragmentation of the European aviation market and ensure that the many bilateral agreements are consigned to the scrap heap from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">The oldest open skies agreement in Europe, the one between the Netherlands and America, is not covered by this decision as it dates back to 1991 and therefore precedes the setting up of the internal market. This agreement, however, will not remain tenable if all other similar bilateral agreements are no longer considered permissible.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain so critical of some of the amendments in this report, however, that if these are adopted here, I can imagine that the Dutch Government would insist on a new decision by the Court, as a result of which the current arrangements with the United States would be delayed for a couple of years. I am very worried about Amendment No 13, which allows Member States to disregard a comment from the Commission on bilateral agreements with third countries. Amendments Nos 2 and 15 permit the monopoly rights of specific airlines to remain unaffected on certain routes. Furthermore, Amendments Nos 3 and 16 entirely deprive the Commission of the verification procedure which enables it to object to bilateral agreements between the EU Member State and a third country. Amendment No 5 also gives the Council the power to overrule the Commission by way of the comitology procedure. Furthermore, Amendments Nos 6 and 7 give Member States the opportunity to allow national interests to play a major role in the conclusion of new bilateral aviation agreements. The airlines themselves will also be the victims on account of Amendment Nos 4 and 18 as they will be poorly informed about any new negotiations or the transparency of what has been agreed. In short, I had the feeling that we would have to put up with the decision of the European Court, but it now seems that real, honest, open competition in the European aviation market is not yet so important and that we apparently want to curb this authority. So I am sorry but I hope that we do not accept the amendments, otherwise I will be compelled to vote against them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has been nearly four years since we completed our report on the single market worldwide challenge in Parliament which favoured general support for a transatlantic common aviation area. I support the granting of a mandate to the Commission to negotiate an open aviation area with the US, replacing the current bilateral agreements and the ownership restrictions which prevent the industry from developing on a global basis. However, we should not underestimate the difficulties which may arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome therefore the Commission's comments on the following points. Although Mrs Palacio is not here today, I would be grateful for a response in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I should like to begin by asking the Commissioner for an assurance that current bilateral aviation agreements with third countries will neither be renounced nor frozen for an indefinite period while Community agreements are hammered out. It is vital that normal business be allowed to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, can the Commission give us its assurance that during the negotiations it will not be lured by the US negotiators into agreeing, as a first step, to a so-called 'early harvest' which, whilst satisfying the current US negotiating requirements, would make the achievement of full liberalisation much less likely?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, how will the Commission address the major issue of the massive cash injection to the US industry of USD 11 billion since 11 September and in addition the Fly America and CRAF programmes with a combined value of USD 775 million? These schemes distort competition and are incompatible both with existing bilateral regimes and any future liberalisation between Europe and the US.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, can the Commissioner also assure us that the airline industry will have a direct role to play in these negotiations, as is the current international practice? Finally, given that a successful EU-US agreement would be a template for further liberalisation on a global basis, can the Commission assure us that no further mandates will be sought by it until a successful agreement is reached with the United States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in itself, a significant breakthrough which will also mean that the Commission will now have a mandate to enter into negotiations with the USA, for example, on behalf of the whole of the European Union, and that could be extremely beneficial, but only if this mandate is so clear that the European Union can in fact speak and negotiate with one voice. We know from other areas how often this turns out to be extremely difficult to do, particularly when we have to do business with the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Member States must be able to continue to negotiate with bilateral partners, and it is therefore necessary for the internal process in the European Union to be properly organised. That is why the rapporteur’s proposal is in favour of not doing everything at once but concentrating on the United States to begin with, at an initial stage. The experience gained in this way will naturally come in useful at subsequent stages. This will also avoid the confusion that would arise if the Commission suddenly had to accept responsibility for all bilateral matters and negotiations or exercise complete control over these.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what my colleague Brian Simpson said about this. It is naturally difficult – that is clear from the amendments – to find a good formula for the role of the Commission on the one hand and the role of the Member States on the other, who naturally also have to take the interests of the aviation industry into account in order to achieve a proper balance in that area. I do, however, think that it is important for Parliament and the Member States, but also the airlines, to be able to play a role in this process, but also to be able to exercise their influence in the execution of their new rules. This is a major operation which can create more opportunities for European aviation, but there is also the risk, and I would like to emphasise that, of an outcome that will bring with it undesirable changes and will thus have a deleterious effect on jobs in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this point about jobs and the interests of our own airlines must remain firmly on the agenda in the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now I can slow down some time in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that at last we are to have a common EU policy on air transport, because the current situation is absolutely idiotic and therefore needs a complete overhaul. Last year’s ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Communities was very positive news. Before that the United States of America had a real stranglehold on the Member States, owing to bilateral agreements. The open skies agreements have prevented mergers between our airlines because no flights have been allowed to the United States from any country other than one in which the European airline is registered. The impossibility of mergers has kept our air services market fragmented, which in turn has nibbled away at our airlines’ competitiveness and led to high prices. Once again the interests of consumers have been eclipsed by the benefits achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of the narrow, national approach, we should realise that national airlines are not an end in themselves but inexpensive and efficiently organised flights are, because the customer, the European, is always right. That is why we should greet civilised globalisation with open arms in this sector too and harness it for the benefit of our citizens. The Commission’s proposals regarding air service agreements are therefore entirely appropriate. I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for his thorough and pragmatic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">When autumn comes the birds fly to the south. If we allow airline competition to increase, less well-off Europeans will also be able to fly down with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally I have listened to all of you, and I shall pass on to Mrs de Palacio all your comments. We have also, Mr President, sent to Parliament’s Secretariat the Commission’s position on each of the proposed amendments.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Perhaps you will allow me simply to make two or three observations in order to reply to some of the questions that you have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr Jarzembowski is worried about the negotiations with the United States. We shall be holding the first negotiations with the United States on 1 October, so work is only just beginning. I believe, however, that we cannot freeze all our agreements with other countries while awaiting the results of negotiations that we have started with the United States. Your rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, referred at the end of his speech to the sovereignty of Member States, and in particular he expressed concern about the question of whether Member States would or would not have to be given authorisation. Yes, Mr Schmitt, they will have to have authorisation. Member States are no longer competent to conclude the agreements for themselves; they now need authorisation at Community level. This, at any rate, is how we interpret the judgment of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Foster also wondered what will become of existing agreements, something that I mentioned just now in my preliminary remarks. There is no question of tearing them up or freezing them: we must preserve things as they are at present. However, it has to be admitted that the legal position has changed following the judgments of the Court. It seems to us, therefore, that we must now, by means of this proposed regulation, consolidate the situation so as to give it legal certainty and avoid any legal problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Commission has sent you its opinion on each of the amendments. It is also puzzled, like Mr Schmitt himself, and as Mr Simpson has pointed out, by the environmental amendments (Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 17), which seek to set precise environmental objectives for these negotiations. The regulation, as I have already mentioned, lays down the procedures governing the bilateral negotiations of Member States. This is not, in our opinion, the appropriate place to set political objectives for these negotiations or to define an environmental policy. Community policies on environmental matters are very well established. I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission will apply those Community policies in the negotiations that it will be conducting, and we hope that all Member States will respect their Community obligations. We do not believe, therefore, that the amendments I have just referred to are appropriate in this context. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
