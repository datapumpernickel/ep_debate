As we all know how difficult it is to reach Strasbourg, we understand all too well when our French fellow MEPs have difficulties with this too.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of goods is one of the European Union’s four basic freedoms. In principle, driving bans, in whatever form, constitute an infringement of this freedom. In both the EU’s core countries, France and Germany, HGV traffic at weekends on through roads is a very sensitive issue for the local people, whose objections we take very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it has to be recognised that HGV traffic ensures that, in our complex society, products and foodstuffs arrive on time. Whilst taking the sensitivities into consideration, we need to try to find a viable solution for all parties concerned subject to these pre-conditions. Along with the European Commission, we believe that we have found this solution in the report by Mr Savary who deserves all credit for this. Nobody needs to cut down the current weekend driving bans by even one minute.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ferber – it would be nice if Mr Ferber, too, were paying attention – nobody needs to cut down the current weekend driving bans by even one minute. We only want to make the bans predictable, thus allowing transport and logistics experts to schedule their journeys in good time and to consult clients about possible different rates of delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the increasing number of uncoordinated new driving bans is a nightmare for the sector. We are trying to solve this by imposing notification duty in respect of new driving bans to the European Commission under the said conditions. This is therefore not about harmonising driving times. We only want to guard each other from surprises. National bank holidays will not be harmonised either. All bank holidays that are already subject to a driving ban can simply remain intact.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission proposal to reach a kind of minimum regulation of harmonised conditions for new driving restrictions deserves our support. It is hoped that this revised proposal will also appeal to opponents of European interference in respect of driving bans. After all, the regulation only applies to the TEN roads. For all other roads, the Member States can determine themselves whether they wish to introduce driving bans. Most amendments that have been tabled by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism form a constructive addition to the Commission proposal. A European information system, for example, is of major importance to the European transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Parliament has tabled amendments that should guarantee good parking and sanitary facilities for drivers who are unable to return home for an entire weekend and are forced to spend that time at a lorry park. The social conditions which drivers face as a result of driving bans can rightly be termed tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">A whole raft of amendments has been tabled to expand the list of derogations. My group will be rejecting all expansions. I personally have to say that I will be voting in favour of Amendment No 21, which pertains to the transport of flowers, although my group will, unfortunately, be voting against it. This will, in fact, hardly affect the driving ban.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that Amendments Nos 4 and 13 jeopardise the directive, to say the least. Thanks to these amendments, Member States can determine at their own discretion whether or not they wish to impose driving bans, rather than via comitology within the European Commission, as has hitherto been the case. These amendments, therefore, undermine the entire proposal. This is why I should like to urge this House to vote against these amendments, as well as against Amendment No 12. In addition, the amendment by Mr Ferber and others will be adopted by my group this time round. We voted in favour of it in the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought that I was scheduled to speak later, but Mrs Peijs has been extremely professional and I thank her and I welcome the support she has given.</p>
<p class="contents">This was an extremely difficult report, a subject already very familiar to all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, given that it has already failed on two previous occasions. We are faced with differences of opinion that are certainly not run-of-the-mill. They are more to do with geographical than political issues, between peripheral countries that wish to transport, and central and transit countries that wish to ban transport. For some time, I feared that we were gravitating towards a contradictory consensus, where everyone would reject this directive: some because they wish to have freedom of movement, others because they wish to have the freedom to impose a ban. I think that we have finally achieved – after many years of work and thanks to a proposal by the Commission, which is already a compromise – a good balance. The only issue to be resolved between us, between those Members who wish to reject this draft directive and the others, is to establish whether we should introduce legislation in this area. I personally believe that we should.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is totally anarchical, which creates unexpected difficulties virtually everywhere in each country and particularly at borders. The dates for the ban only apply in seven out of nine countries: these are not co-ordinated, they give rise to illegal parking on motorways, and even sometimes in motorway service area car parks. As a result, lorry drivers are very often away from home because of difficulties in scheduling their journeys and, lastly, the dates make it very difficult for hauliers and the transport economy to organise the logistics chain.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this legislation is valid from all viewpoints. First of all, because I believe that we have the necessary legal bases. It would be extremely paradoxical for European road transport, which was Europe’s first transport sector to become established, now to return to being auxiliary. The European Parliament would be sending out entirely the wrong message if it said, at the end of the day, the title relating to Transport in the EC Treaty does not apply to road transport. How then could we dictate that, in the future, it will apply to rail, to the maritime sector and to all the other sectors?</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I feel it is very important for a Europe of transport to be implemented and that it leads us towards a policy which was also alluded to in the White Paper, and I think that this is a good reason. There is, however, another, even more important reason: we currently have no legal certainty as far as bans on movement at weekends are concerned and the countries – and I say this to those who wish to reject the proposal – which would like to strengthen this proposal unilaterally would expose themselves to legal proceedings and to possible appeals based solely on the principles of the freedom of movement and non-discrimination and which would most probably pose a threat to a number of existing bans, as well as to the regulation that is commonly known as the ‘strawberry regulation’ of 1998, which has recently been imposed on France in order to allow lorries to travel through the Mont Blanc tunnel. I therefore believe that this will guarantee security for all countries that have introduced bans.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would reiterate that the proposal by the Commission provides a legal basis for what are currently the most stringent bans, namely those in Austria and Germany, and which ensures that the other countries can choose whether to conform to them. The proposal is, in fact, to introduce bans similar to those in Germany and Austria with specific or not so crucial derogations, an exemption scheme in other words, and I will be giving my personal support to Mrs Peijs in calling for the introduction of an exemption for fresh flowers and horticultural products, as I believe that these are products that are difficult to keep fresh. In short, by imposing bans on the movement of HGVs at the weekend, we are being extremely flexible as well as providing reassurance. I live in a region where there is heavy HGV traffic, and I cannot imagine meeting my constituents to explain that the European Parliament does not wish to ban HGV traffic at weekends, which would of course be huge step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has finally managed to find a <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span>. Tomorrow, we must examine the 21 amendments, which were adopted in committee, and the 18 new amendments. I do not think that we should alter the balance of the text too greatly and I myself will call for the amendments tabled by the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities to be rejected, namely Amendments Nos 30, 28 and 31, which ultimately propose to return to the Commission’s draft text that was rejected in 1998 and which specified “Sundays only” – this is too little. Secondly, I will propose that we reject Amendments Nos 22 and 23 as well, which were tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and which, conversely, and this is perfectly legitimate, would result in the Commission acquiring greater powers than anticipated in the text. Lastly, I agree with Mrs Peijs that some amendments distort the text and that we must not therefore venture down that path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also, of course, welcome Commissioner De Palacio to the House. I nevertheless believe that some of us, myself included, were right to table a number of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The plethora of often diverse rules and regulations certainly means that the lot of HGV drivers – mainly men and rarely women – can hardly be called an easy one. It must not, though, be forgotten that it is at the weekends that many members of the public want to have a bit more peace and quiet, and that it is at that same time that drivers want to go on trips. Hence this conflict. I therefore think that there should be mutual solidarity between the population in general, including the haulage business, and the overwhelming majority of the public involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur took the view that such solidarity could be better organised. He was right, but planning for it is often difficult. In my opinion, the transport industry could certainly plan convoys better if it knew about the weekend bans so that the result would not, as is often at present the case, be these periods waiting at borders, which are admittedly unpleasant. So better information would make that improvement possible – and the Commission also has a few things planned, which the rapporteur supports. Railways, too, certainly offer a possible alternative to some degree.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I think there is a lot to be said in favour of leaving the status quo as it is. There is also much to be said for doing so without coming up with a specific rule on the subject. That is also the thinking behind some of the amendments that have been tabled. I would nonetheless like to take this opportunity of reiterating in the clearest possible terms that the Group on whose behalf I am now speaking supports the rapporteur's basic line wholesale. What results we achieve are a matter for democracy and for tomorrow's vote. In any case, the rapporteur has done a good job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That Mr Vermeer is unable to attend today is due to the HGV traffic that is not allowed to drive on Sundays but that subsequently causes so much traffic on Mondays that he is unable to get here on time. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not the purpose of this proposal, namely the harmonisation of driving bans on the Trans-European Network, that is called into question by my group, but the way in which this is done. A general expansion of weekend driving bans is a very sensitive issue in our group. A driving ban, however useful it may be, has a drastic effect on the principle of the free movement of goods and hits the peripheral countries the hardest. Especially for those countries, the grapes are sour because the benefits of the internal market are not always that evident to them. The introduction of a driving ban simply causes a greater traffic flow on a limited number of days and with it, an entirely different traffic pressure, even in the so-called transit countries. The irony of this artificial state of affairs is that the Member States on the TEN network, which often enjoys EU funding, are entitled to introduce driving restrictions without these being adequately examined by the Commission, for example, on their usefulness. </p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the ELDR Group, I have therefore tabled a few amendments that should make this possible. The aim of my amendment is to allow Member States to introduce a driving ban if this is justified on the basis of various criteria, such as the environment, safety or on social grounds. This should prevent a proliferation of driving bans from being imposed. I would therefore ask for your support for Amendment No 23. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rapporteur’s Amendments Nos 4 and 13 are concerned, in which topographical reasons are given to justify driving bans, these are not acceptable to my group. What exactly is a topographical reason and how is it defined? In the explanatory note to that amendment, reference is made to the Alps. However, the Dutch polder landscape can also form a topographical motive for a driving ban, for example. This concept is, in my view, wide open to misuse. Should these Amendments Nos 4 and 13 be adopted during the vote of this report tomorrow, then I, as the shadow rapporteur, will advise my group to vote against the report as a whole. Let us leave the internal market open and not create too many restrictions or opportunities for restrictions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If some companies had their way, it would be possible to drive without any time restrictions, during the day, at night, during weekends and on bank holidays. This type of driving would benefit this industry which, in permanent competition with the railways and internal shipping, tries to be the fastest and the cheapest. HGV drivers who are employees are pleased about driving-time restrictions, which aim to protect their own health, but not about compulsory waiting at uncomfortable locations. Self-employed drivers, who are often former employees who, under pressure from their managers, have had to take over the business risk, want to drive without any time restrictions in order to be able to keep their heads above water financially. If, on the other hand, it were up to the residents in the vicinity of through roads, HGV traffic in Europe would be kept to an absolute minimum, and it would certainly not pass through built-up areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, mountain valleys and mountain passes. </p>
<p class="contents">Local authorities welcome HGV traffic only to the private industrial sites, because these generate employment and income, and not through traffic, which only generates inconvenience. There is now a plethora of measures by means of which local authorities and regions protect the environment and their Sunday rest, and try to level out dangerous peaks in traffic. For a large majority of people, it is important for this freedom to be retained without facing unnecessary barriers to cross borders. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Savary’s proposals make the bans on TEN routes predictable. However, I would prefer to see the fast transport of perishable agricultural products, to which he gives due consideration, transferred to the railways, and for that reason, I do not endorse his proposal for a derogation. For the rest, I believe that he has struck the right balance between the different conflicting interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The former and the latter often come into conflict, a conflict of interests, and we therefore understand the need to apply certain restrictions to movement in order to safeguard co-existence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, several Member States have established differing timetables and dates for restrictions, which is creating great confusion for hauliers, for the senders and receivers of cargo, as well as disturbance in the freight market in terms of distribution and supply.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this means that we need to seek a minimum degree of harmonisation at Community level in relation to timetables for restrictions and to this end it will firstly be essential to provide an effective information system for hauliers. We also need reliable statistics on congestion on the Trans-European Networks, on its peak days and hours etc., and also on the ecological impact of high traffic densities, in order to better protect our environment. Furthermore, we must take advantage of these restrictions on heavy goods traffic to ensure that drivers enjoy a minimum period of uninterrupted rest.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it would not be democratic for some Member States to be able to maintain their previously established restrictions indefinitely, while the new States are not allowed to introduce them. It is only fair that this privilege should last for a limited time period.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Savary, on the quality of his report and on having managed, after two previous failed attempts, to bring about a parliamentary debate during this plenary on regulations harmonising traffic restrictions, which are so essential to the effective operation and co-existence between the market and the people and to the environment in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must strike a balance between, on the one hand, the authority of Member States to incorporate moments of peace and quiet in the flow of traffic and, on the other hand, to maintain the free movement of goods and services. Since national authorities are unable to strike this balance, a European framework is required in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">How wide should this framework be? Any change to existing bans cannot expect to meet with a great deal of support in the Member States concerned. We will have to accept these bans. However, with a view to enlargement, a framework for new driving-time bans is possible. Such a framework need not be very wide. After all, it only contains additional bans. The timeframe should, in my view, be limited to Sundays. This is in line with the special position of Sundays and can prevent a build-up of recreational and goods traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of this regulation can be limited in various ways – by criteria which allow a driving ban to be imposed, or by exemptions for certain vehicles or goods. Too many derogations would render the regulation ineffective. It is not clear to what extent heavy goods vehicles have an impact on road accidents. More information on this would be very useful. On this basis, preventive measures would be possible to improve safety.</p>
<p class="contents">A less appropriate idea is to include social provisions in this text. This is not the place for these.</p>
<p class="contents">We are far from striking a proper balance between social and economic interests. I would therefore warmly recommend the amendments tabled by my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferber (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time that the Commission has tried to concern itself with matters that do not actually have to be regulated at European level. That is what is at the heart of this report, and that is what we have to grapple with. Is today's free movement of goods disrupted by national restrictions on journeys? I will tell you quite clearly that such is not the case, for if it were, the Commission would be entitled even now to take action against the Member States in the European Court of Justice. It has not done so to date, and so no disruption of the free movement of goods can have occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will never manage to harmonise Europe's public holidays. That too is indeed part of the regulation. I do not imagine that France, that <span class="italic">grande nation</span>, will ever let anyone prevent it celebrating 14 July, and we in Germany will also resist any attempt at doing away with 3 October. What this means is that we have different rules on travel restrictions as it is, because our public holidays are different.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it was as long ago as 1998 that the Commission, guided by your predecessor Mr Kinnock, proposed to limit the travel ban to Sundays, and that is the direction they are actually going in. Hence it is not on for us, when we vote today or tomorrow, to agree to the European Union being given the right to enact regulations of any kind on travel bans. These are things that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, must not be regulated other than at the level of the Member States, nor, indeed, can they be.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have started an initiative across group and national lines and tabled an amendment to reject the Commission proposal. I would like to ask my fellow Members of this House to vote in favour of this amendment. The European added value in this is not self-evident. There is no European added value, because the derogations in the proposal are such that nothing will change in real terms. If this is all about making information available, then it goes without saying that the Commission is entitled to set up information systems as appropriate without drafting legislation. My dear Commissioner, it is simply not enough for all the public holidays in the European Union just to be announced in the Official Journal. If the establishment of information systems is what it is all about, then you have my entire support, but that is something the Commission can do on its own responsibility without resorting to a directive. That is what I would ask you to do, so that the regulations prevailing in the individual Member States can be made known to everyone throughout the European Union who will be affected by them.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that this is also about preventing the proliferation of derogations. It is right that perishable goods, and foodstuffs in particular, should be excluded from the restrictions. It is not, however, clear to me what added value accrues to us if cut flowers can also be transported on Saturdays and Sundays, – in summer, moreover, when everything is in bloom anyway – and can also be transported on Saturdays in winter. So let us, I beg you, vote against this proposal. Let us allow the Member States to decide on it for themselves in compliance with the subsidiarity principle, and then we will also have the public behind us in European matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s rewording of the proposal is to be welcomed; it is a balanced proposal and is entirely justified given the requirements for legal certainty and the growing divergence between national provisions, which set transit countries in radical opposition to countries that are geographically remote. The territory of the European Union now constitutes a single area without frontiers as regards roads, and the forthcoming enlargement will mean increased tensions in the absence of minimum harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the excellent work undertaken by the rapporteur, Mr Savary, particularly on the proposals for amendments on the creation of a European road information system, on extending exemptions for the transport of flowers and fresh horticultural products, as well as on the social conditions arising from the disparities in national provisions that could be resolved by social measures. The report has suggested some measures, such as periods of compensatory rest time and extra pay arrangements. I think that this already provides a good solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good compromise, and one that I support. For a start, the Member States can impose restrictions on heavy goods vehicles within the time-spans that have now become customary, namely Saturday, Sunday and national public holidays. Secondly, the scope envisaged has been chosen on the principle that there should be no discrimination between domestic and cross-border traffic. The directive governs only cross-border traffic on the trans-European transport networks, the Member States having the right to enact legislation to impose additional limits on domestic traffic using the road network as a whole. Thirdly, and in addition to the derogations under ordinary law, the national authorities have a margin for manoeuvre to enact supplementary derogations for the trans-European transport networks used for cross-border transport of goods. Fourthly, sanctions and the monitoring of the system of restrictions remain a matter for the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has, among other things, taken on board two important amendments. The first of these has to do with the creation of a European apparatus for road traffic information, and the second with the extension of the derogation to flowers and fresh horticultural products. On this very important point, Mr Ferber, our opinions differ. Adoption of this directive will create legal certainty, so that different arguments will no longer be able to be brought before different courts. Road safety will be enhanced, and the detriment to people and nature will be minimised. Member States that already take a more liberal approach will not be compelled to introduce more restrictive measures, and those with tighter restrictions on convoys of heavy goods vehicles will not be forced to liberalise them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, Mr Savary’s arguments concerning the legal basis – which is necessary because we may otherwise be facing legal battles – are sound. I also think it is important to maintain the status quo. I am saying this against the interests of my country and those of its transport sector. In this case, I take the view that the interests of the core countries should definitely prevail where the problems I described a moment ago are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The periphery, where, for that matter, the ports are situated and traffic originates in the first place, should adapt itself to this. And then it becomes abundantly clear that, if the free movement of goods is thought to be restricted, we should realise that there is always inland shipping, there is always railway transport and that there is always the option of short-sea. If you travel from the Netherlands to Italy, I would advise you to use short-sea. We are all working very hard on this. In my view, Mr Savary is right to introduce Amendment No 13. I would only suggest to him to re-insert the words “exceptional cases” which he has omitted, where restrictions are concerned, because this does put a brake on the whole thing. I shall leave it there, and to Mr Vermeer, I would suggest he take the train next time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I shall say it for the record.</p>
<p class="contents">It is ludicrous that somebody always cries out to the Commission for help when the Austrians close the Alps. Yet when we do something really sensible, like imposing standard rules for traffic restrictions, he questions whether the Community is competent to do so. I would take this opportunity to remind him that you cannot take a stand on more than one platform at once. The whole thing is quite logical. We are discussing traffic across borders, the trans-European networks, and our desire, expressed in the White Paper, for an efficient system for utilising them, and along comes an MEP and says that Europe has no competence in this area. I can only say that such a thing is laughable, absolutely laughable.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I am from Germany, a country battered by transit traffic, with lorries crossing it from north to south and west to east, I nonetheless take the view that we need European regulation. We must have rules to sort out the conflict of objectives between the interests of the local citizens – who are opposed to noise and to clogged roads – and the interest of the economy in getting traffic through.</p>
<p class="contents">We complain about high unemployment, but if we want to deal with unemployment, we need economic growth. You cannot get economic growth off the Internet. You can order goods that way, but, as you have to have them delivered, jobs in industry depend on the efficient utilisation of the trans-European network. The assertion that this has nothing to do with Europe, and that every country can do as it likes, is positively absurd, and our being on the threshold of EU enlargement makes it all the more so. We should be giving the countries that are about to join us a sheaf of unambiguous and harmonised regulations that they know they can stick to and be guided by. There is a general need for European regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply have to declare that nobody, not even the Commission, wants to use the system of efficient reporting and monitoring of supplementary restrictions to change the Member States' public holidays. That is just nonsense. This is primarily about weekend journeys. That is the issue. Any haulier or employer has to know when and where they can pass through and when and where they have to stop. Then, of course, there have to be proper parking places with sanitary facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, there is just one question to which I would like you to give me an answer. Mr Savary, who was a very good rapporteur, has proposed this European apparatus for road traffic information. Are you prepared to support it? If you are, then I would tell Mr Ferber that, if we want an efficient information system, we have to lay it down in a directive, in order to require the Member States to play their part. We know that Member States do not supply up-to-date data if systems are voluntary. So that is what we need. Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, are you ready to support Mr Savary's great idea for such a mechanism?</p>

Restrictions on transport may well improve, to some degree, the protection of the affected citizens and the environment in vulnerable regions from noise and pollution, but, in the long term, only determined support for rail travel can achieve the dual objective of securing the quality of life of the public in Central and Eastern Europe and giving the countries on the edge of the EU good access to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the directive itself, I welcome the introduction of comparable statistics, but the unbalanced guidance on EU transport policy at the present time leads me to think that we still need extensive rights for the Member States, to enable them to defend themselves against an unbalanced EU transport policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems therefore to have escaped the attention of the author of this startling claim that the UK does have a frontier with the rest of the European continent. It is called the English Channel, or <span class="italic">la Manche</span>, if you prefer. It may not be a road frontier, but the 22 miles of sea at its narrowest point does make a great deal of difference. You might have also noticed that we drive on the left and that there are certain other differences in the road systems in the UK. We have different commercial systems and a different tempo of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we have evolved our own system of controls. They work after a fashion and, while we thank the rapporteur for working on the system of convergence plus freedom, which gives Member States the freedom to set their own rules, we do not need your freedom. We are quite capable of setting our own rules and we are quite happy to have our truck drivers abide by yours. Therefore we do not need your convergence either and we do not need harmonization. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Savary, for the subtle and skilful way in which he has dealt with such a delicate, difficult and complex issue, on which, as has been said, there have already been two previous failures with different reports presented on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the health of the road transport sector is fundamental to the fluidity of intra-Community trade and the European economy, and that we are talking about one of the essential freedoms which form the fundamental pillars of the internal market and of the constitution of the Communities. At the same time, we know that the sector is experiencing difficult times: the pressure of competition – which is very strong – the congestion problems on many routes, the difficulties of crossing certain points – such as the Alps – concerns about road safety and strong social pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems do not just distort the image of the sector, but they are real problems which may become worse as a result of enlargement. That is why the Commission stressed the urgent need to adopt a series of measures for a Community strategy to increase the coherence of the road transport sector and to strengthen the internal market within that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Members know all of these measures presented by the Commission – many of them during the French Presidency – which were also debated in part and which formed part of our analysis of the White Paper. The proposal on traffic restrictions we are discussing today must be viewed in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly believe that it is important to introduce Community rules in this area and to organise weekend restrictions for heavy goods vehicles for the whole of the Union. Seven of the fifteen States already impose restrictions for certain categories of vehicle. The lack of coordination of this type of measure hinders the functioning of the internal market in road transport, and the Commission and the majority of States are in favour of common rules which establish a durable, clear and transparent system and which provides, as has been said, a combination and a difficult balance between two opposing interests: the citizens’ right to enjoy roads at weekends which are not entirely congested and the freedom of transit of goods across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s current amended proposal has attempted to respond to the initial objections, by clearly indicating that it applied solely to heavy goods vehicles on international routes and on the European transport network. It therefore still falls to the Member States to impose restrictions of differing durations on all roads outside this network which include the other national roads. The proposal harmonises the timetable for weekend restrictions, but does not jeopardise the current restrictions in the large majority of Member States. It also establishes a system of notification of the days, including holidays, on which the Member States propose to impose restrictions. I am therefore replying to the question by Mr Jarzembowski and I thank him for his support. In principle, we agree with Mr Savary’s request and there are just a few remaining questions with regard to the application of a cost-benefit analysis and with regard to the intensity of the proposed information mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to specific amendments, the majority can be accepted, specifically twenty of them. But there are some which we must reject, namely No 32, simply because it rejects our proposal. We also reject Amendments Nos 4, 13, 35 and 38, since they allow States to introduce a restriction and simply inform the Commission and thus the other States and their transport workers. We believe that this shows an excessive degree of inflexibility which cannot be accepted and that the comitology system is adequate and that it maintains and offers guarantees to everybody. Neither can we support Amendments Nos 24 to 28 or Amendments Nos 30, 36, 37 and 40, which introduce an excessively restrictive approach, which would harm the balance and the quality of the proposal. Amendments Nos 18, 29 and 31 would add additional requirements which the Commission cannot accept, because they are disproportionate to the proposed objective; I am referring to burdens such as the compilation of statistics, lists of infringements and fines, and going further on certain aspects of road safety, not to mention the internal market. Finally, we reject Amendments Nos 2, 23, 25 and part of 39, since we do not believe them to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank Mr Savary for his tireless work. We must deal with this report with enthusiasm and not become discouraged, because the positions seem so opposed that an agreement appears impossible. But like Mr Savary I believe – and this is why I have presented this modified proposal and have continued to insist – that we have to seek a midpoint which will clearly not satisfy anybody, but which may provide a balance which reasonably takes account of the different interests involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that we also have to remember that the internal market will shortly be extended towards the East and that, in those circumstances, it will be even more necessary to seek a coordinated approach and position and a degree of harmonisation. We are not talking about total harmonisation, but rather a minimum degree of harmonisation of the rules on traffic restrictions on the Trans-European Networks which guarantee appropriate freedom of movement of goods within the Union, which is essential to the economic development and economic activity of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Madam President. Thank you very much, Mr Savary. I hope that Parliament will finally adopt the Savary report tomorrow since I believe it to be balanced and I believe it is the best report we could have achieved for both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
