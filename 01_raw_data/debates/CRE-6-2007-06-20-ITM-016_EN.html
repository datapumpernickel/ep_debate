I am therefore delighted that Parliament has produced the Klich report on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There are threats such as terrorism, organised crime, drug trafficking and the trafficking of illegal immigrants that are of a global, international, nature, and the European Union and its Member States cannot therefore tackle them alone. The cooperation of third countries, and particularly of neighbouring countries, is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress three fundamental ideas. Firstly, that the construction of this area is a crucial objective. Achieving the cooperation of third countries must therefore be a priority within the external action of the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, that this cooperation cannot therefore solely be the competence of the very active and competent Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security, nor of the JHA Council, but also of the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Affairs Council, the High Representative and the Commissioner for Cooperation. The Klich report therefore places particular emphasis on this necessary coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I share many of the points of view of the Commission’s 2005 Communication on the external dimension of the area of freedom, security and justice. However, in the chapter on the principles that must govern policies regarding third countries, I would have included the principle of positive conditionality. In other words, we must incentivise and stimulate the cooperation of third countries. We cannot be indifferent as to whether or not they cooperate with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, when it comes to illegal immigration, which is unfortunately so topical in Spain, we cannot be indifferent as to whether or not they sign readmission agreements, whether or not they assist in the identification and documentation of their nationals, or whether or not they tolerate the activities of the organised mafias that traffic in illegal immigrants We must call upon them firmly to cooperate in all of these areas and reward them accordingly. Furthermore, we should monitor and assess that cooperation. In this regard, there is already an assessment mechanism, established following the Thessalonika European Council in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are living in a globalised and highly interdependent world and, therefore, without the cooperation of third countries, the security and freedom of our citizens and the control of migratory flows will be more fragile and difficult to safeguard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, therefore, important to coordinate our strategy for freedom, security and justice with the European Union’s external policy. I should like to thank our two rapporteurs, Mr Klich and Mr Sakalas, for having managed to establish our priorities in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of migration, it is not enough for us just to strengthen our borders. We must create a genuine dialogue with third countries, based above all on protection of fundamental rights and democratisation. We wish, thus, to ensure that fundamental rights become an integral part of all European instruments, by including a ‘human rights’ clause in agreements concluded with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against crime and international terrorism will only be effective if we cooperate closely with our allies. We must, however, remember that, for the European Union, the fight against terrorism must above all include strengthening human rights. We cannot use the same weapons as the terrorists. Let us oppose violence and barbarism with the rule of law and justice! We insist, therefore, that European institutions take care that the requirements of Member States within the context of the fight against terrorism do not in any way compromise respect for the fundamental rights of any person, even when they are suspected of the crime of terrorism, in accordance with the conclusions of our Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to come back to the issues of Swift and Passenger Name Records (PNR). Our American friends are important allies. Consequently, we must negotiate an overall policy for the exchange and protection of data that respects European legislation in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately he is not here, but, worse still, the Council is absent once again. I take that as a sign of its lack of commitment to these important matters, in particular to the human rights aspect of our external relations, to which I will return later. When it comes to taking security measures, measures against terrorism and crime, then the Council is always present and able to take very quick decisions, but when human rights are the issue, it is not here. I would like to emphasise that point.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important report, because it touches upon the very core of the European Union, namely democracy, human rights and individual freedoms. I am particularly happy with the first indent of paragraph 17, which states that the promotion of democratic standards, human rights and political freedoms is a key dimension of external relations and central to our overall goals.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, that is one of the report’s key paragraphs. In the last six years we have taken many measures in the fight against terrorism and crime, but this action has been very unbalanced because the human rights aspect has been completely underexposed. We have talked a lot about human rights, civil liberties and democracy. However, I wonder if we still have the same moral authority in the world, if we look, for example, at Guantánamo Bay, the CIA renditions and secret detentions and the fact that the Council has, until today, failed to reply to any of the issues that were raised.</p>
<p class="contents">If I consider that the human rights violations in Russia meet with only very timid condemnation by the European Union and that the summit this weekend will very probably eliminate the Charter of Fundamental Rights from the Constitution, I wonder what kind of political signal we are sending. I think we should stop talking about the principles of human rights and democracy and actually start putting them into practice and taking them seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">A second issue is, of course, democratic accountability, which the rapporteur rightly strongly underlines. It is very important for the European Parliament to be much more closely involved in these matters and I therefore endorse the call for a <span class="italic">passerelle</span>. It would, however, be even better if the Council arrived at conclusions on a treaty or a constitution this weekend that would ensure democratic control in the area of civil liberties, justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Martine Roure has already highlighted an important point concerning the fight against terrorism. With regard to the topical cases of SWIFT and PNR, we have to say that there is no democratic oversight and that the agreement we will probably reach with the Americans simply does not meet our standards. I am beginning to wonder – and again I am addressing the empty chair in front of me – how hard the Council has been negotiating. We know that the Commission has made a major effort, but I wonder about the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Small informal groups such as the G6 and the High Level Contact Group meeting behind closed doors on matters of anti-terrorism do not befit a modern democracy like the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reality of what we have to deal with, of the new threats that are posed before us, whether it is terrorism, people trafficking, drug trafficking, asylum, illegal immigration and the pressures that are put on the services that deal with all these areas, highlight one single point most of all: human interaction or human involvement is at the core of all these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incumbent on us within the European Union to ensure that we put every tool at our disposal, not only to guarantee the safety and security of our own regions and areas but also to ensure that the rights of people are protected: those who may be suspects, or even those who may have met a suspect at some stage. We find too often that, merely by association, you could be guilty of committing a crime under some of the new draconian laws that have been brought into different countries. That is why cooperation and coordination between the various Member States is important, because not only does it facilitate and allow the free movement of information and intelligence, which is essential in tackling so many of these crimes, but it also allows for best practice to be in force among the police forces or security services that may not be as good as others.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we used to have the idea of the ‘open coordination’ method whereby good things led to the other good things. There are positive things in European Union countries that other countries can follow, not just third countries but also Member States. Because of the complexity of the legal systems that in the different Member States, there still needs to be oversight by the Council of Ministers. This is not an area that can be given exclusively to European Union competence. I hope that at the weekend we will find a proper compromise towards that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are celebrating World Refugee Day and I remember the remarks made, right here, by Kofi Annan, describing as shameful the European Union’s policy in relation to asylum and immigration. What has changed since? Despite the conflicts that mark out the world, the European Union accepts fewer and fewer refugees. The number of asylum seekers in the EU has reduced by half since the 1990s. Today, for example, the rate of acceptance of asylum applications for people from Darfur is incredibly low. The European Union also refuses to accept its responsibilities in relation to Iraqi refugees. More than four million Iraqis are today forced to move and, in spite of that, the German Presidency has stated that Member States do not wish to take part in a resettlement programme for refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The heated negotiations on readmission agreements obliging third countries to admit on their territory any person in transit there causes, as you know, disastrous humanitarian situations and serious violations of the right to international protection and of the principle of non-refoulement. These agreements transfer to third countries responsibilities that they are not generally capable of assuming. This ‘forced march’ policy discredits in part the efforts made in other respects for the protection of fundamental rights in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission ought to make clear and practical proposals to get away from this schizophrenia. A transparent monitoring procedure for these agreements needs to be set up; effective recourse in the event of violation of rights following refusal of entry should be put in place. The Commission could also appoint, within its Frontex teams, people with special training in human rights and humanitarian law to properly ensure that international commitments and conventions are being observed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union anti-terrorism coordinator is not subject to any institutional control, either by the European Parliament or by the national parliaments. No progress has been made on any question of democratic control. We had a serious obligation in the field of civil liberties and the confidentiality of personal data in the name of combating terrorists. I will mention just two points: the use of biometric data in all citizens' passports and the lifting of confidentiality on telephone and Internet calls.</p>
<p class="contents">What we protected in the old days as nations and as states and kept as the apple of our eye, we now sacrifice and we almost look on anyone fighting to maintain freedoms and individual rights as aiding and abetting terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The secret services of the United States and other states are acting without control outside their state, thereby infringing a serious of articles under international conventions of law. A typical example are the secret CIA flights. And yet all the European Union and everyone who voted in favour here in Parliament does is to ratify the incorporation into Community law of the Prüm convention, the last word when it comes to monitoring citizens in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more measures are being promoted which come within the security agenda of the European Union and which of course serve its strategic perceptions about its foreign policy, including increased arming of the military and participation in military operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of the European Union's taking a leading role at international level so as to study the causes of the waves of immigrants and put an end to the huge divide between rich and poor countries, we prefer to introduce rapid intervention forces with Frontex in order to 'rout' immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the policy you are following not only fails to resolve the problems which it seeks in theory to resolve; on the contrary, it exacerbates them. The single area of freedom, security and justice with the content you attribute to it is increasing the lack of freedom, insecurity and injustice.

Maintaining our stability and security depends, among other factors, on our relations with our neighbours and with other countries around the world, and on this point, we must be focused and must send out clear political messages.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I shall be voting against the rapporteur’s proposals aimed at removing references to CIA flights. Many of the problems we face are common to a large number of other countries, and the EU’s experiences – and its success or failure – in dealing with these matters will prove a useful benchmark for these countries. We have made huge progress in many areas and once again I should like to thank Mr Frattini on his outstanding work in the Commission. Much remains to be done, however, on asylum and immigration, on the fight against organised crime and terrorism, on border management, visa management and police and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Programme and its action plan clearly set out the areas of cooperation with third countries. Responses must be found, however, to specific issues. Firstly, there is the problem of consistency between the pillars. External action as regards freedom, security and justice is sometimes transversal in nature and encompasses fields that fall under various pillars. While this system of having to have more than one pillar remains in place, coordination between the pillars needs to be improved in order to prevent overlapping between the various instruments belonging to the area of freedom, security and justice. It is vital that as many as possible of these issues can be introduced under the first pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the problem of the complexity of the internal institutional framework. It is crucial to introduce codecision and qualified majority voting in areas relating to legal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Parliament’s role must be strengthened: Parliament has a vital role to play in reinforcing the democratic responsibility of the Union’s external action and it must be kept up to speed with the negotiations on agreements relating to the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, reference must be made to the common European asylum system and the strengthening of resources relating to Frontex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should welcome the fact that the Union finally has a strategy for implementing the Hague programme. It has been a long time coming. Nearly every year, Parliament has discussed organised crime, corruption, money laundering, illegal immigration and human trafficking, the fight against terrorism, the fight against drugs in Afghanistan, the CIA, data protection, etc. It has also suggested ways of dealing with these phenomena. As a result, it has taken a long time for the strategy to develop and take on its current shape.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain questions arise. What do we want the strategy to achieve? How do we plan to do this? Why do we want to do it? The report’s answer to the first question is that, first and foremost, we want to improve the way in which democracy functions. We also want police and judicial cooperation, as well as cooperation in all areas of human rights protection and the fight against terrorism. In other words, we want cooperation on internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we going to achieve this? We have already developed mechanisms for this, primarily the neighbourhood policy. We have institutions such as EUROMED and EUROLAT. We also have bilateral and multilateral agreements. However, all this is not enough. We want the European Parliament to play a bigger role. We want it to be consulted on a greater range of matters. We also want a better division of competences between the Member States and the Union, in order to be able to resolve these matters more quickly and easily. The only real cure is a European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a third question: why do we want to do all of this? The reason is that we are concerned by the fact that our external partners’ actions are not always in line with European Union standards. If we want partners beyond the European Union who not only know what democracy, the rule of law and justice mean, but also apply these principles in practice, we must provide them with assistance. The report proposes suitable mechanisms to achieve these ends.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, our external actions extend the area of democracy, security, freedom and justice far beyond the borders of Europe. This is important for the citizens of third countries, but is also incredibly important to European Union citizens. A broader, more global and common area of freedom and democracy will make the lives of EU citizens safer and democracy more stable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a serious blow for the EU, the community of values, which speaks loudly of human rights. One might say that it is shameful for the EU if it quietly accepts the presence of secret detention centres. There are detention centres in Europe because US law does not permit them on US soil. In Europe the Commission and the Council have kept very quiet, and the reports by the Council of Europe have led to barely any action being taken, and Member States have not been hauled up over this to any satisfactory extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else I wish to bring up is the EU summit at the weekend. I hope that agreement will be reached there that the Charter on Fundamental Human Rights will become legally binding, so that the EU’s decision-making bodies will also appear before the courts if human rights are not observed by an EU institution or EU authorities. Otherwise, I hope that human rights issues will be taken a little more seriously in the EU in practice and not just on formal occasions.

Do you know, however, how effective the cooperation coordinators — Eurojust, Interpol and Europol — are, and how effective the agreements on police or judicial cooperation are? My personal experience shows that even in the simplest cases a check on basic evidence initiated by the minister for home affairs and the national public prosecutor’s office concerning cases of corruption at the management level of Latvia’s police required half a year in Latvia itself, although less than an hour would have been necessary for a check on the basic evidence in the relevant Member State. Mr Frattini, in my view it is absolutely unacceptable, in issues of inter-state judicial assistance, in cases of the highest significance concerning crimes of a political and economic nature on a national scale, for correspondence with non-EU countries to be drawn out over three or four years. Such is actually the case for the pace of the investigation into the case of the mayor of Ventspils, A. Lembergs. Such a pace in providing judicial assistance does nothing to successfully combat corruption. Unfortunately, this situation creates a legal nihilism in society, which expects crime to be tackled effectively. Mr Frattini, I would therefore draw your attention to the fact that there are individual cases where new instruments are necessary to distribute and examine cases of various categories on a priority basis, in particular, and – and this is important – not only on all sides, but also quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support it and I congratulate the rapporteur on his report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been talking and writing a great deal for a very long time about the strategy of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, but we do very little. We have our subject list, we have our thoughts and recommendations, but we do not have the Community spirit needed to take drastic measures to combat the institutional problems which arise. There is no decisiveness to take action outside the European Union. Each Member State stands rooted on the ramparts of its national sovereignty and we prevent effective joint action. For example, the refusal to use the 'passerelle clause' is, unfortunately, hampering the functioning and efficacy of the European Union and if the European Union malfunctions, it reflects very acutely on the sector of justice and internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The pillars, unanimity and the fear of moving away from national standards are obstructing the promotion of a joint strategy to create a real area of freedom, security and justice. These obstacles are hampering the application of the strategy, not only within the European Union, but also outside it and the external dimension of the Hague programme is as important as its internal dimension. Only a modern, constitutional framework will help to fundamentally promote the strategy for an area of freedom, security and justice. The historic bet of a European Union that functions better needs to be answered correctly by the leaders of the Member States when they meet in Brussels tomorrow. They must all assume their historic responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I only have one minute of speaking time, I will just mention two issues. The first is terrorism. Whether we like it or not, terrorism is, to a significant extent, related to Islamic culture. We would limit its occurrence in Europe and the world if we became less involved in matters related to the Muslim world and if we finally accepted the right of the Palestinians to their own country. When it comes to this group of people, the word terrorism is overused, as their actions are, to a certain extent, simply a part of the fight for the freedom they lost in 1967. Their actions have often been a response to ours.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is immigration. Efforts to integrate immigrants in Europe are costing us too much, they only help a small number of people and usually produce few results. It would be better to spend this money on education in the immigrants’ countries of origin. Controlled immigration seems to be a fair idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

România a preluat responsabilitatea de graniţă externă cu maximă atenţie, investind sume importante în sistemul integrat de securitate a frontierelor, realizând cel mai performant sistem în domeniu. Este nevoie, însă, în continuare de sprijinirea atât a României, cât şi a celorlalte ţări care sunt frontiere externe ale Uniunii.</p>
<p class="contents">Frontex are în acest sens un rol operaţional deosebit, iar alocarea de fonduri pentru lărgirea capacităţii sale de funcţionare ar reprezenta expresia colaborării şi solidarităţii dintre statele membre. Operarea cu ţările vizate de politica europeană de vecinătate reprezintă o garanţie suplimentară pentru prevenirea şi combaterea terorismului, pentru lupta împotriva crimei organizate, a imigraţiei clandestine sau a traficului de orice fel, precum şi pentru protecţia cetăţenilor Europei.</p>

<p class="contents">In adopting the strategy on the external dimension of the area of freedom, security and justice in 2005, the European Commission's aim was to export to other states the values incorporated in the internal policy of the European Union, namely the rule of law, respect for human rights and international obligations. The strategy even includes action in the sectors of immigration, people trafficking, protection of human rights, terrorism, organised crime and so forth and of course we support all this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it needs to be pointed out that all of us – and the European Commission – are very sensitive on the issue of the protection of citizens' human rights, a point which needs to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all of us must know that this endeavour is not easy, nor must spectacular results be expected in a short space of time, because coordination efforts by all the Member States and systematic support from the Commission are required.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this report gives me the opportunity to repeat that I, as a Member of the European Parliament, feel that I am 'playing' the role of simple sidekick in this Chamber, of a simple spectator, given that the European Parliament per se takes no part in the consultations and is barely even given adequate information on these issues and because ultimately, any report which we, as Parliament, submit to the Commission, is taken into very little account by it. Of course the unapproved Constitutional Treaty made provision for solutions which improved Parliament's standing, which created preconditions so that Parliament could be a real parliament. That is why we must hope that the efforts being made by Mrs Merkel will have tangible results, even though I fear that certain Member States will stand by their reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Commission must demonstrate more of a disposition towards close cooperation with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cu toate acestea, cetăţenii a 12 state europene au încă nevoie de vize pentru a călători în SUA. Acest lucru constituie o violare a principiului reciprocităţii, întrucât toate statele UE au eliminat obligativitatea vizelor pentru cetăţenii americani. Mai mult, noile state membre au acceptat în procesul de aderare să preia Regulamentul 593 al UE, care suspendă vizele pentru unele state terţe, precum SUA. România a primit din partea Comisiei Europene promisiunea fermă că poziţia sa în privinţa eliminării vizelor va fi preluată în relaţiile Uniunii cu SUA.</p>
<p class="contents">De aceea, cer Comisiei să se folosească de toate instrumentele care-i sunt conferite de legislaţia europeană, de la negociere până la propunerea de instituire a unor măsuri echivalente pentru cetăţenii americani. În plus, Comisia trebuie să ridice problema vizelor în toate negocierile sale cu SUA, fie că este vorba de acordul privind evidenţa călătorilor, care se negociază în acest moment sau de alte înţelegeri din domeniul justiţiei şi afacerilor interne.</p>

First, it explicitly mentions the <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clause, encouraging Member States to improve their much-needed cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs. Furthermore, it recalls the need for greater parliamentary oversight, as provided for in the Constitution and hopefully the new institutional treaty to emerge by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for greater coherence between the union’s internal security strategy, the AFSJ, and its external ones, the CFSP and ESDP. The sources of instability are not only internal, but clearly also external. Ultimately, it is only by strengthening the rule of law and human rights in its near-abroad that the Union can succeed in securing an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The trafficking of women and children, weapons and drugs needs to be weeded out at the source. It is no use increasing internal controls inside the EU if the problems pile up on our borders. If the new EU External Action Service is properly created, it can provide a meaningful contribution to countering this challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This means that the European Union must act with unity in defending an area based on liberty, security and justice. That applies to both foreign policy and internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">As head of the Moldova delegation, I must repeat that the situations of deadlock in Moldova and Georgia are now the most dangerous sources of instability in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to the elimination of these sources of conflict lies with the Kremlin. We must definitely improve dialogue with Russia. This does not mean complimenting Russia, but engaging in open communication with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot highly value a partner that uses the Russian minority in the Member States and countries covered by the neighbourhood policy in order to destabilise the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must clearly state that this does not correspond to our understanding of good neighbourly relations. During the April riots that took place in Tallinn, a person was killed, namely a Russian citizen. Moscow is willing to pay for the continuation of the outdated ‘near abroad’ doctrine with the blood of its own citizens. Of course the European Parliament cannot accept this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union urgently needs cooperation mechanisms that will work efficiently even with the present greater number of Member States. I hope that the European Council session that begins on Thursday will be sufficiently statesmanlike to achieve an agreement that will enable the European Union to become a giant in global politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
