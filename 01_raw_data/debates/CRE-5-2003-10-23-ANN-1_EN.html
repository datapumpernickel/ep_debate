<p>As to the specific point regarding President Arafat, the Council has urged the Israeli Government to refrain from executing its decision in principle to remove the elected President of the Palestinian Authority, which would be counter-productive to the efforts at reaching a peaceful solution to the conflict.

<p>The Council also made clear that there is no alternative to a swift and full implementation, in good faith by the two sides, of the roadmap.

<p>(IT) The Council agrees with the Honourable Member that trafficking in human beings is an important issue. It is also a complex issue. It needs to be addressed both at national and at international level. And it needs to be dealt within a broader context, which goes beyond criminal law and also involves asylum and immigration policies and preventive measures.</p>
<p>With regard to the assistance of victims of trafficking in human beings, it is recalled that the Council bodies are currently considering a proposal for a Directive submitted by the Commission. Its objective is to offer to the victims who show their willingness to co-operate and effectively co-operate with the authorities in the proceedings initiated against the traffickers, a certain number of benefits, and in particular the possibility to remain legally in the territory of the Member States for the entire duration of the relevant proceedings. Such treatment is intended to help the victims to recover and to escape from the influence of the traffickers. As it clearly appears, the approach adopted by this instrument offers a two-fold advantage: for the Member States, in their fight against the traffickers and for the victims, who may be granted a legal status under certain conditions and for a period linked with the duration of the proceedings.</p>
<p>As far as criminal law is concerned, the EU has in particular adopted the Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings. On the basis of this instrument Member States must provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties regarding trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation or sexual exploitation. For defined aggravating circumstances, the maximum penalty provided by Member States must be of at least 8 years imprisonment. The instrument also contains provisions on liability of legal persons and on jurisdiction and prosecution. It must be implemented by Member States at the latest by 1 August 2004.</p>
<p>The Council has also adopted measures on trafficking in human beings, namely the Directive of 28 November 2002 defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence and the Framework Decision of the same date on the strengthening of the penal framework in that regard. These measures must be put in place by the Member States at the latest by 5 December 2004.</p>
<p>A number of more general criminal law measures taken will also contribute to the fight against trafficking in human beings. Examples are the European arrest warrant, Eurojust, the EU Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters and the European Judicial Network.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0576"></a>

<p>(IT) The Council shares the concern about the state of the cultural treasures mentioned by the Honourable Member, which form part of the world heritage. The Council recalls to the Honourable Member that in a resolution adopted on 6 May 2003, the Council confirmed that a basic principle ruling the EU, as a community of cultural values and sensitivities, is the respect and protection of world cultural heritage. It also recalls that in another resolution on horizontal aspects of culture, adopted on the same day, the Council stressed that an extra effort is needed to be made to include culture in other sectors with the aim of placing culture at the heart of European integration.</p>
<p>The Council has not discussed this specific issue and has no indication of the extent of the damage and resources needed to support conservation and protection of these pieces of art or on the way the Turkish authorities are taking the matter into consideration. However, the Council recalls that the accession partnership includes a reference indicating that membership of the European Union requires inter alia compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. These aims therefore include the community of cultural values. Furthermore, the Council recalls that incorporation of the ‘acquis communautaire’ into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient as it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0582"></a>

<p>As the Honourable Member points out, it is extremely important to inform the public better about the European Union. The various institutions' activities directed at the press contribute to pluralism of information. The Council, like the other institutions, has a duty to provide the public and the press with information and explanations, a duty to which it attaches the utmost importance.</p>
<p>The 'press and information' aspects cannot be seen as separate from these activities, given that these are political in nature. One or more Presidency press conferences and national media briefings are therefore held on the occasion of each Council meeting, whatever the date on which it is held. To ensure that information on the Council's business and decisions is as rapid and exhaustive as possible, such press conferences must be held as soon as possible and as close as possible to the Council meeting.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council has noted the European Parliament's agreement on the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking', which provides for the three institutions to hold a joint press conference whenever negotiations reach a successful conclusion under the codecision procedure, irrespective of whether this occurs at first or second reading or even as the successful outcome of conciliation.</p>
<p>The Council will abide by this undertaking as soon as the interinstitutional agreement is signed and enters into force.

In its statement at the Second Preparatory Committee of the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT (Geneva, 28 April-9 May 2003), the EU recalled the special importance it attaches to achieving universal adherence to the NPT in order to reinforce the global non-proliferation and disarmament objectives, which are at the core of the Union's policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0597"></a>

<p>Nevertheless, the Council recalls that the European Council, at its meeting in Stockholm on 23-24 March 2001, dealing with the demographic challenge, urged the Union and the Member States to act by defining new approaches, in particular by raising employment rates, adapting social protection systems including pension systems. Special mention was made of pressure on social care of the elderly to be counterbalanced. In line with these conclusions the Employment Guidelines, adopted by the Council on 22 July 2003<a href="#defann_11_3" name="refann_11_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, recall in respect of older workers (55 to 64) that a target was set by the European Council to raise the employment rate of this category to 50% in 2010.</p>

<p>(IT) According to the report of the Commission on the practical experience gained with one year of circulation of Euro banknotes and coins (doc. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0747">COM (2002) 747</a> final), counterfeiting of Euro notes and coins has, since their introduction as from 1.1.2002, taken place at a much smaller scale than what was previously experienced with national banknotes and coins.</p>
<p>This being recalled, the Council has provided, in regulation 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, a comprehensive framework for co-operation between the relevant actors, namely competent national authorities, credit institutions, the national central banks and the European Central Bank, in order to ensure effective protection of the euro against counterfeiting. This regulation 1338/2001 provides furthermore, in its article 9, for close co-operation on this issue with non Member countries and relevant international organisations. By regulation 1339/2001, this legal framework has been extended to non euro Member States.</p>
<p>In the field of criminal law, the Council has in particular on 29 May 2000 adopted the Framework Decision on increasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro. This instrument provides that counterfeiting of money, and a number of acts related to that, such as fraudulent uttering of counterfeit money, transporting, receiving and obtaining counterfeit money and fraudulent acts concerning instruments peculiarly adapted for counterfeiting, must be punishable in a way that makes extradition possible. The key offence, counterfeiting of money, must be punishable with a maximum penalty of at least 8 years of imprisonment. All EU Member States which have adopted the euro, must have jurisdiction regarding counterfeiting of the euro, independently of the nationality of the offender and the place where the offence has been committed. The deadline for implementation of the instrument by the Member States was 29 May 2001. A first implementation report has been established, and a second is being elaborated. It may be concluded that, in general, the instrument has been implemented in a satisfactory way by Member States.</p>
<p>The Council has in addition in Decision of 6 December 2001 (2001/887/JAI) on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting laid down measures in respect of expert analysis of notes and coins and exchange of results of analyses and other relevant information. The necessary steps have also been taken to ensure the competence of Europol in respect of counterfeiting, and for the purpose of establishing agreements between Europol and Interpol and other parties in this field.</p>
<p>The instruments referred to are part of the acquis that the incoming Member states must have implemented by the date of accession.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Council adopted on 2 October 2003 a Council recommendation on measures to protect the euro against counterfeiting.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0608"></a>

<p>(EN) There exists a range of civil protection measures, which include EU and national instruments covering the following possible actions on civil protection following terrorist attacks using biological or chemical weapons:</p>
<p>CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) Action Programme: under the mandate of the European Council of Ghent, the Council and the Commission adopted, on 20 December 2002, a programme to improve co-operation in the European Union for preventing and limiting the consequences of CBRN terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Within the general field of Civil Protection, a Community Mechanism to facilitate reinforced co-operation in civil protection assistance has been established by a Council decision of 23 October 2001.</p>
<p>The Health Security Committee (HSC) has been set up on 26 October 2001. The HSC is comprised of high-level representatives of the Member States charged with raising the alert, exchanging information rapidly and co-ordinating health responses in case of emergency following a deliberate release of biological or chemical agents to cause harm.</p>
<p>Other EC instruments exist in the areas of animal protection, atomic questions, energy, environment protection, transport, telecommunications, food protection, plant safety and research.</p>
<p>Military forces have developed inherent capabilities and specialised units to perform their military tasks to deal with CBRN threats. These assets are focused primarily on force protection. Nevertheless, such capabilities and units may be used, on a case-by-case basis, to support civil protection against CBRN terrorism. Obviously, the military assets and capabilities of Member States can be called upon by the competent authorities of that State, to perform tasks in the protection of their civil population. The use of those assets and capabilities might be provided on a bilateral basis or in the framework of a co-ordinated approach within the Council or through the Community Civil Protection Mechanism pursuant to the national legislation of the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>Finally the Council would recall that this is an area which has become a major focus of attention recently and there are improvements to be made.

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is well aware, one of the priorities of the European Union is to ensure that the Lisbon objective of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 is achieved. The role that SMEs play is of crucial importance for meeting this goal. The report on the first year's activities of the SME Envoy designated by the Commission in 2001 underlines the importance that this role could play at the Community level in helping to achieve this objective.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will appreciate that the provisions of Article 157 of the Treaty are relatively limited in nature and that it does not fall within the competence of the Community to take decisions on what measures individual Member States should take, such as the designation of SME envoys. However a good deal of the work undertaken in ensuring industrial competitiveness covers coordination and in particular the open method of coordination under which the exchange of good practices between Member States is an important element. This leads to a system of mutual learning and comparison of result.</p>
<p>In this context, the Council has on several occasions adopted conclusions or resolutions where the importance of fostering entrepreneurship and creating favourable conditions for the establishment, continued operation and growth of SMEs has been stressed. These in addition underline the importance of establishing efficient lines of communication between the SMEs and national authorities and the need to reduce to a minimum burdensome bureaucratic procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0599"></a>

<p>(EN) The SARS outbreak showed how quickly new diseases are able to emerge and spread and how a well co-ordinated response can stop the situation from degenerating into a crisis.</p>
<p>Strengthening the networks of preparedness and response to such diseases is a top priority. Health Ministers agreed at the Extraordinary Health Council of 6 May 2003 to bring together expertise to mount an effective response to SARS. An expert group on SARS was subsequently established.</p>
<p>Co-ordination of surveillance and response are key elements for the early detection of SARS cases and for stopping the potential spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken a leading role in this in the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission informs the Member States, the Acceding and EEA/EFTA Countries on a routine basis on developments concerning SARS. In case of emergency, the Commission will inform these countries through its Early Warning and Response System.</p>
<p>This system was used successfully during the last SARS incident in Singapore.</p>
<p>On that occasion the Commission asked the SARS experts’ group to provide comments on the event and an opinion on its follow-up. The replies indicated that there was no need for urgent action, although the developments should be closely monitored.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by the Panel of experts of the Singapore Ministry of Health, inappropriate laboratory procedures led to the infection.</p>
<p>The Union has now a strong system in place to monitor and to co-ordinate the response to the SARS virus.</p>
<p>In response to the SARS outbreak the Commission organized a special call for research proposals within the context of Sixth Union Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6 2003-2006). EUR 9 million will be made available to fund new research to help tackle SARS. The special call which closed on 30 September 2003, covers amongst others, surveillance and control, clinical manifestations including disease transmission, infection control procedures, interventions and vaccines, and risk assessment.</p>
<p>If SARS returns, the intensive surveillance approach will be applied again and the recommended measures that have been proved to work to control the outbreak, that is case detection, patients isolation and infection control, and contact tracing will be restored.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for the opportunity to speak on the important issue of smoking in the workplace. The question is very broad, and there is no time here to give a really comprehensive response.</p>
<p>However, the implications for the Union as a whole in public health and economic terms of active and passive smoking in the workplace can be at least briefly outlined in the present answer.</p>
<p>From a public health perspective, half a million people die in the Community each year from the effects of tobacco consumption. This mortality rate is predicted to keep rising, so that smoking will continue to be the biggest single form of avoidable death in Europe.</p>
<p>This affects not just active smokers. Studies have repeatedly shown that if someone is regularly exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, through passive smoking, he will have a higher risk of the diseases that it causes. International studies have shown that exposure to tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>Smoking in the workplace therefore becomes a major risk factor for the health of employees. A review of evidence<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in Ireland last year found that people who don’t smoke, but who work in a smoking environment, have an increased risk of lung cancer of between 20% - 30%. The risk of heart disease also increased by about the same amount.</p>
<p>There has always been a strong dose-response effect in relation to tobacco. That is to say, the more someone is exposed to it – the higher his risk of developing serious illness. It stands to reason therefore that people who work in very smoky environments such as bars and restaurants are at a particularly high risk of developing cancers and heart disease.</p>
<p>These businesses employ thousands of people in Europe. The Commission believes that they too have a right to be protected from cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that an estimated 20% of the European population who suffer from asthma and other respiratory illness. Like all non-smokers, people with these conditions suffer from tobacco smoke and have their long-term health put at risk. But, moreover, smoky rooms trigger or worsen their day-to-day symptoms.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, it is important to remember that almost half of smoking related deaths occur in people aged between 35 and 69 years of age. This is at a time when people are particularly productive from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>The loss of productivity and consequently income can affect not only businesses but also households and individuals. The prevalence of cigarette smoking is strongly associated with social class, meaning that the poorest families are most affected by the ill health and loss of income that it causes.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view restricting smoking in the workplace is an important part of the jigsaw to control tobacco use in the population. Not only are non-smokers protected, but such initiatives may help smokers who are trying to give up. However it is important that workplace based actions are seen in the context of a broader tobacco control policy that includes regulation, taxation policy and smoking advice from health professionals.</p>
<p>As far as legislative action is concerned, the relevant Commission Services are examining the issue to determine any eventual European input into this process. However, in developing this debate, it is important to consider the central role which national and local regulators have to play in identifying suitable measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member has referred to recent statements made by the Member of the Commission in charge of Health and Consumer Protection concerning GM authorisations and in particular the approval of BT11 sweet maize.</p>
<p>It is correct that product applications are moving through the approval procedures as foreseen in Community legislation. This is nothing new.</p>
<p>The authorisation procedure provides that a GM product has to be scientifically assessed for its risks to health and environment prior to its placing on the market.</p>
<p>If concluded to be safe and if the product fulfils all the necessary requirements in Community legislation, it can be placed on the market.</p>
<p>One of the product applications which has now reached that stage is the BT11 sweet maize. This GM maize is for approval for food use under the Novel Food Regulation.</p>
<p>BT11 has received a favourable opinion from the Scientific Committee on Food and since then the Commission has been in contact with the companies to establish the appropriate conditions for authorisation.</p>
<p>The Member of the Commission in charge of Health and Consumer Protection understands that we now have a validated a detection method for BT11 and therefore believes that we are ready to move forward and authorise the product in accordance with the Novel Food Regulation.</p>
<p>Applications are also moving through the procedure under Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment - for which the Member of the Commission in charge of Environment is responsible.</p>

The UK currently has a derogation allowing it to apply a zero rate of VAT to personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>Given the great importance of crash helmets to road safety for motorcyclists, and given the popularity among younger citizens, does the Commission agree that derogations from VAT regulations permitting zero rating for safety equipment of this kind should be sustained?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is aware, in July 2003 the Commission adopted its proposal for a Directive concerning reduced rates of VAT. The primary objectives of this proposal were both to allow all Member States an equal opportunity to apply reduced rates, and to rationalise and simplify the complex web of current derogations. The expected outcome is a considerable improvement in the functioning of the internal market and a reduction in market distortions, something which has given rise to numerous complaints from traders.</p>
<p>It is essential that the Union ensures a more equitable treatment of all Member States, both old and new. The derogations granted to the United Kingdom, and other Member States, were, from the first, only intended to be transitional measures. It is now time for a certain degree of rationalisation, particularly in light of the agreements with new Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission has examined the VAT treatment of motorcycle helmets throughout Europe. Only the United Kingdom applies a non-standard VAT rate to these products. Since 14 Member States apply a standard rate of VAT, which can vary between 15 and 25 percent, the Commission did not include a reduced rate for motorcycle helmets in its proposal.</p>
<p>As regards the effect of a reduced VAT rate on the safety of motorcyclists, any such effect is necessarily limited. A Directive of 1989 makes the EC mark compulsory for all products with specific protective features, ensuring a high level of safety protection for users. Moreover, this mark contributes to market transparency, as products that conform to the Directive can be visibly distinguished. Nevertheless, the price of such products differs considerably, even though the level of protection is the same. Consequently, the VAT rate applied has only a marginal influence on the final product price.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commission has proposed to confine the scope of zero rates to those goods and services listed in the new Annex H, to rationalise and simplify the current structure of rates. Since motorcycle helmets have never been subject to reduced rates, the United Kingdom's derogation, only ever meant to be temporary, should now disappear.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the light of the principle of the free movement of goods I should like to raise the following matter. A French armourer from Alsace, who also deals in hunting weapons, chiefly those made in Germany, is facing serious problems in carrying on his business. He can no longer simply pick up weapons produced in Germany, where most European hunting weapons are manufactured, from customs in Alsace. Instead, he must first obtain an import licence from the centralised customs authority recently set up in Paris. However, such licences are very difficult to obtain, must be issued before the transaction in question is completed, are valid only for six months and are made available only on completion of a lengthy procedure. Moreover, he cannot import weapons owned by private individuals from Germany, given the impossibility of providing the relevant tax numbers or other details in advance.</p>
<p>Would it not be consistent with the existence of the European Economic Area and its founding principle, that of the free movement of goods and persons, if the authorities were to at least simplify these procedures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The circulation of civil firearms is, at the Community level, regulated by the Council Directive of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (91/477/EEC).</p>
<p>Following the provisions of this Directive, any commercial transfer of civil weapons is submitted to prior authorization by Member States involved in this transfer. The Commission has, of course, no authority to impose on any Member State the choice of the authority (central or local) competent to grant this type of authorization.</p>
<p>When the transfer is operated between private persons, or between a qualified dealer and a private person, the procedure above mentioned is applicable. It implies that a certain amount of information must be given in order to obtain, within a reasonable delay, the authorization.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that these details must be given prior to the granting of an authorization in the case of the circulation of weapons between a professional dealer and customers located in different Member States.</p>
<p>In case of transfers involving only qualified dealers, no prior authorization might be required.</p>
<p>Should a fiscal identification number be required for the granting of the authorization, this requirement would not be regarded as contradictory to the Directive, as its Article 3 allows Member States to adopt in their legislation provisions more stringent than those provided for in the said Directive.

The expected outcome is a considerable improvement in the functioning of the internal market and a reduction in market distortions, something which has given rise to numerous complaints from traders.</p>
<p>Currently, Member States have already the possibility to apply reduced rates to ‘medical equipment, aids and other appliances normally intended to alleviate or treat disability, for the exclusive personal use of the disabled, including the repair of such goods’. The Commission has proposed to extend this category in order to cover ‘apparatus and electrical, electronic or other equipment and means of transport, designed or specially adapted for the disabled’. Repairs of such goods are also covered. In addition, this category includes those having a serious or chronic illness.</p>
<p>There is no contradiction between the Commission's proposal and the concerns the Honourable Member has expressed in his question: the Member States will have an increased ability to apply reduced rates of VAT for disabled people.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that the Commission's proposal allows the United Kingdom to keep the zero rates currently applied on these same goods, since all Member States will be allowed to apply reduced rates.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the Commission is only extending the reduced VAT rates on aids and equipment used by disabled people, it has not undertaken any studies to assess the impact of a new taxation of equipment for disabled people, since there is no new taxation envisaged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member is right in saying that there has been much talk about extended impact assessments this year. The Commission takes this new approach very seriously. As far as its future proposal on services is concerned, the Honourable Member can be assured that much work has gone into the preparation of the accompanying extended impact assessment and that the Commission is on track to deliver it with the Services Directive in December. It will draw on existing service statistics, a wide range of studies on the development of the service economy and, most importantly, on extensive information that the Commission has received from interested parties over the past three years.</p>
<p>Following the call for action by the Lisbon Summit, the Commission adopted its Internal Market Strategy for services in December 2000. Since then it has been consulting and receiving information on Internal Market barriers and on how they affect both business and consumers. After a first round of consultations it adopted a Report on the State of the Internal Market for services in July 2002, the findings of which were endorsed by both the Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>On the basis of further information received in response to the Commission's Report and continuing consultations with the Member States and interested parties, the Commission is confident not only that it will be able to deliver its proposal for a directive on services and the accompanying extended impact assessment on time but, more importantly, that the latter will provide a clear picture of the directive's expected contribution to economic growth and job creation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0517"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission supports the media of regional and minority language communities through several actions.</p>
<p>The Commission finances the Mercator network whose main role is the collection, storage, analysis and circulation of information via an information and documentation network intended for the Union’s regional and minority languages. The Mercator Media centre covers the following areas: press, publication of books, archives and libraries, as well as television, radio and new media.</p>
<p>The European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages – a body that is 80% financed by the Commission – also recognises the media as important and thus finances the implementation and running of a press agency EUROLANG (http://www.eurolang.net). Created in 2000, this agency deals with all medias and broadcasts news and information about linguistic diversity in Europe. It covers events of general interest for the language communities concerned as well as information at European level.</p>
<p>The Bureau also created the portal Lingualia (http://www.lingualia.net/) in collaboration with the Mercator network. This European portal for regional and minority languages in Europe, aims to be a quality Internet service for all regional and minority language communities. Part of the information relates to minorities in the candidate and accession countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the context of enlargement, the Commission has just launched an extension to the Euromosaic study (http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/). This study will enable us to have a thorough knowledge of the situation regarding regional and minority languages in the candidate countries, in particular of their presence in the media.</p>
<p>Finally the Media programme makes financing audiovisual works possible. Nine candidate countries already have the opportunity of receiving funding from this programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0523"></a>

<p>Parliament has noted year after year, in its reports on human rights in the EU, the dramatic and disturbing state of affairs in the Union's prisons. It has repeatedly called on the Council and Commission to take action to define certain minimum standards with regard to respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of prisoners in the Union. The President-in-Office of the Justice and Internal Affairs Council, Mr Roberto Castelli, has announced on behalf of the Italian presidency, at hearings held by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, that an inquiry is to be carried out into the execution of sentences and prison systems. Mr Castelli stated in an article published on 7 August 2003 in the 'Corriere della Sera' that he had 'launched an initiative for the definition of thresholds of acceptable conditions in the EU's prisons'.</p>

<p>(EN) In its Programme for 1 July – 31 December 2003, the Italian Presidency had stated that it would take an ‘initiative’ for monitoring prison conditions throughout the Union with a view to drawing up new forms of treatment of offenders in order to improve crime prevention. However, no initiative pursuant to Article 34 of the Treaty on the European Union has been made by the Presidency on this subject.</p>
<p>The three questions by the Honourable Member are interlinked and cannot be answered separately.</p>
<p>The treatment of prisoners and pre-trial detainees is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. However, the Commission does support the Italian Presidency’s view that better information on the prison population is essential background to the development of mutual recognition and enforcement of custodial and non-custodial measures throughout the Union.</p>
<p>At the request of the Italian Presidency, the Commission has drawn up a questionnaire on statistical data on the prison population, including pre-trial detention, in the Member States and in the accession countries. The questionnaire was sent to the Member States and the accession countries before the summer, but the Commission has still not received all the replies.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to include a short analysis of the replies in the two Green Papers that are currently being prepared in this area: 1) the Green Paper on the approximation, mutual recognition and enforcement of criminal sanctions in the Union, and 2) the Green Paper on mutual recognition and enforcement of non-custodial supervision measures and pre-trial detention. The Green Papers will also consider the question of the legal basis for taking any eventual action in this area.</p>
<p>Article 6 of the Treaty on the European Union obliges the Union to respect fundamental rights but does not provide a suitable legal basis for a Union legislative instrument.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that any consideration of a possible framework decision on minimum standards in this area would depend on the outcome of the consultation planned on the basis of the Green Papers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>However, the Directive states as a general principle that only cosmetic products that do not cause damage to human health can be put on the market (Article 2 of the Directive).</p>
<p>Therefore, cosmetic products must only contain safe ingredients. Regarding an adequate safety assessment of cosmetic products, there is an obligation for the manufacturer to keep information on its cosmetic products readily accessible for the control authorities of the Member States (Article 7a of the Directive).</p>

<p>The Commission asked Member States and the industry to present scientific data for the safety evaluation of these substances by the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for the Consumer (SCCPNF).</p>
<p>Based on data submitted by the industry a safety evaluation of three substances was initiated. These substances (hydroquinone, benzoyl peroxide and hydroquinone methylether) are now subject to restrictions and conditions laid down in Annex III of the Cosmetics Directive following the recent adoption of Commission Directive of 24 September 2003<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>

Parliament considered that special attention should be devoted to the special characteristics of sparsely populated and peripheral regions in accordance with Article 2 of Protocol 6 to the Act of Accession for Austria, Finland and Sweden and Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>How will the Commission take account of Parliament's proposals that permanent geographical handicaps should be recognised and taken into account when formulating regional and structural policy in the next programming period?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Sapir Report, presented by Commission President Prodi, proposes setting up three funds (Growth, Convergence and Restructuring) which will be financed with the budget currently earmarked for the CAP and Regional Policy, which they will replace. This initiative, endorsed by the Commission President, flatly contradicts the Treaties, along with the acquis communautaire and the major policies deriving from Title XVII of the Treaty on Economic and Social Cohesion (Art. 158, Art. 159, Art. 160, Art. 161, Art. 162). Furthermore, it is odd that Mr Sapir and his assistants should ignore the Community aspects of union, as well as social welfare and solidarity, in their proposal.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission, and the Member of the Commission in charge of the Budget in particular, take this issue very seriously. This issue shows how important the work of OLAF is. Together with the Vice President, the Commissioner responsible for the budget recently initiated an exercise to obtain assurances from all services that certain practices alleged to have operated in Eurostat have not been used since the present Commission has been in office. Regarding the steps already taken and those planned, as was outlined in President Prodi's speech on 25 September to the Conference of Presidents, this matter has been the subject of investigations by OLAF and the Internal Auditor of the Commission and of a report of a Special Task Force, and, finally, a detailed examination by DG Budget of the conformity of the acts described in the Eurostat audits with the Financial Regulation. Following the discharge resolution on Budget 2001 and at the request of the Parliament, the Internal Audit Service (IAS) was mandated by the Commission to examine the legality and the regularity of a sample of contracts concluded by Eurostat since 1999 and to include in its investigation contracts concluded by other Commission services, with Eurostat involvement. The Parliament will be informed by the end of October 2003. On 9 July, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against three senior officials in Eurostat and further ones will be made should they be justified by the discovery of new facts. The organisation of Eurostat will be thoroughly overhauled. A new Director General has been installed and a new organisation chart adopted. Regarding the contracts involved, the Commission has decided to cancel those with organisations and companies likely to be implicated in this case. The true extent of the amounts involved still needs to be assessed.</p>
<p>A number of fundamental measures have already been introduced under the Reform to strengthen control and accountability. In particular the Commission wants to mention: moving to de-centralised ex-ante controls, introducing new financial circuits, setting internal control standards and a new Financial Regulation. In addition, DGs are required to report annually on their activities and to make a declaration on the use of resources and on the legality and regularity of transactions. Furthermore, the Commission, as announced by President Prodi, will seek to consolidate the Reform in the areas of the relations between Commissioners, cabinets and departments and between the central administration and outlying departments in the area of control and audit. Measures have already been taken in this regard in requiring Directors General to report at least twice yearly to Commissioners on audit and internal control related issues and they cover also the exchange of information with OLAF. President Prodi committed himself to present to the Parliament an action plan in November in order to remedy to shortcomings identified through the Eurostat affair.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0543"></a>

During the period under consideration Union direct budget support amounted to US$ 232 million, that is just over 50% of the residual stock. These figures show that a surplus does not exist.</p>
<p>In the mean time the budget of the Palestinian authority remains under strong pressure.

<p>Regarding the arrangements that have been made to monitor the use of the Commission contribution, it should be recalled that the Commission contribution is conditional upon concrete reforms in the financial management of the Palestinian Authority.

<p>(FR) The Commission investigation that opened on 11 December 2002, in accordance with Treaty requirements, is intended to determine whether the advantages that the Region of Wallonia and the airport operator (BSCA) conferred on Ryanair when it moved into Charleroi in April 2001 (rebates on landing fees, defraying Ryanair staff costs, defraying marketing costs, financial incentives each time a new route is opened, etc.) are equivalent or not to state aid and, if they are, whether these advantages are compatible with the common market or whether on the other hand they constitute distortions of competition to the disadvantage of other operators, whether these are other airlines or other airports.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing the final decision in this case, having received numerous comments from interested parties, from Ryanair and from the Belgian authorities.</p>
<p>The aid to Air France, which was approved by the Commission in 1994, is aid for restructuration of an undertaking. The Commission scrutinises this aid in the light of guidelines on restructuration aid, and in this case the criteria for approval were met. Several other European companies have obtained this type of state aid and have been subject to the same checks by the Commission. The period at the beginning of the 1990s was marked by the first stages in liberalisation of European skies and the national flag carriers, which until then had been protected on their national markets, have had to undergo substantial adaptation and restructuration.

<p>(FR) The Commission is aware of the request made to the French authorities by Electricité de France (EDF) regarding the modification of the discharge limits for liquid radioactive effluents within the framework of the renewal of discharge authorisations for the nuclear power station at Cattenom. It would appear that this modification involves a general reduction of discharge limits for all radionuclides apart from tritium, for which an increase is apparently requested.</p>
<p>If the French authorities intend to grant a new discharge authorisation for the Cattenom nuclear power station involving an increase in the discharge limit for tritium in liquid effluents, they must, in accordance with the provisions of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, communicate to the Commission the general information relating to this modification. In that event, following consultation with the group of experts referred to in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, the Commission will issue, within 6 months, an opinion on the radiological impact of this modification on the population of other Member States.</p>
<p>The granting of authorisations to discharge radioactive effluent falls within the responsibility of the Member States. The practice for setting established limits within discharge authorisations may differ between Member States and depend in particular on the characteristics of installations. These limits conform to the basic standards set at Community level, which are aimed at maintaining a non-significant level of radiological impact. On a regular basis, the Commission publishes assessments of real discharges of radioactive effluents from the Union’s nuclear stations and reprocessing plants. This data is available to the public, on a simple request, from the services of the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0555"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has not been informed of the way in which the Altadis Group intends to deal with the social consequences of the ongoing restructuring of the company.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, would like to recall that, over the years, the Union has developed a comprehensive policy for dealing adequately with the social consequences of corporate restructuring. As a result of that on-going policy, every restructuring operation must be preceded by effective information and consultation of employees' representatives with the aim of avoiding or attenuating its social impact, in accordance with Community Directives on ‘Collective Redundancies’<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, ‘Transfers of Undertakings’<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, ‘European Works Councils’<a href="#defann_46_3" name="refann_46_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and, from March 2005 onwards, ‘Information and Consultation’<a href="#defann_46_4" name="refann_46_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In particular, Directive 98/59/EC concerning collective redundancies provides for information and consultation with the workers' representatives in cases where the employer is contemplating such redundancies. These consultations should be carried out in good time with a view to reaching agreement and cover, at least, ways and means of avoiding collective redundancies or reducing the number of workers affected as well as of mitigating the consequences by recourse to accompanying social measures. These measures aim, inter alia, at aid for redeploying or retraining workers who have been made redundant.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission advocates the idea that, when restructuring, enterprises should always take into account the effects that those decisions could have on their employees as well as on the social and regional context. This has recently been underlined in the Commission Communication concerning Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): A business contribution to Sustainable Development<a href="#defann_46_5" name="refann_46_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission invited the European social partners to engage in a dialogue on anticipating and managing change with a view to applying a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring. The social partners are in the course of concluding an agreement on this. The Commission very much hopes that their joint work in this field will result in a Community framework which disseminates throughout Europe good practices of corporate restructuring, thus helping companies and their workers to adequately address its social dimension.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 3 September 2003 King Sihanouk made an important statement, with particular reference to Montagnard refugees, which included the following remarks: ‘We (Second Kingdom of Cambodia) have a Constitution (1993) which has established a liberal democracy in our country and not a false 'democracy'. And we have signed United Nations human rights conventions. ... We must not return oppressed people asking us for asylum to the countries which they have fled'. The statement confirms the fact that the Cambodian authorities are pursuing their capture and forced repatriation policy, thereby fuelling a fully-fledged black market: Vietnam is paying a ransom of $50 to $100 for each Montagnard who is returned. The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr Leuprecht, has repeatedly stated that such actions are a threat to the lives of deportees. They also constitute a serious violation of the UN Refugee Convention. One of the most recent incidents, concerning four Montagnards, took place on 7 August 2003. When will the Commission finally persuade Phnom Penh to put an end to the ongoing violations of the UN Refugee Convention? What action will it take to make it clear that the EU will no longer tolerate these violations of the EU-Cambodia agreement?

<p>(EN) The Commission’s Delegation in Phnom Penh, together with the Diplomatic Missions of the Member States, continues to follow closely the situation of the Vietnamese Montagnards and other asylum seekers who seek refuge in Cambodia.</p>
<p>The representatives in Cambodia of the Commission and the Member States also remain in close contact with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on this issue. At present there are still more than 80 recognised refugees, most of them Vietnamese, under UNCHR custody in Cambodia awaiting resettlement in the United States.</p>
<p>The Commission has been informed that discussions are on-going between the UNHCR and the Government of Cambodia on the possibility of putting in place a system to deal with asylum seekers in accordance with the UN Convention. These efforts are fully supported by the Commission.</p>
<p>However, at present it is clear that concerns remain regarding the treatment and reception of asylum seekers in Cambodia. Taking into account the closure of the UNHCR camp in Mondolkiri in April 2002 and considering that the UNHCR is still denied free access to the North-eastern border areas, the situation of Montagnards asylum seekers, arriving from Vietnam, is particularly difficult.</p>
<p>The issue of non-refoulement is of particular concern after reports confirming the deportation of four persons by the Cambodian border police in August 2003 as well as two Chinese nationals in 2002. The Commission is also aware of reports regarding alleged ‘rewards’ for Montagnards who are handed over to Vietnamese authorities but so far it has not been able to confirm the accuracy of these reports.</p>
<p>The Commission's approach towards Cambodia in the field of human rights, as it is towards all countries in the region, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns where abuses occur, in the framework of the international human rights instruments.</p>
<p>The Commission, together with Member States, will therefore continue to urge Cambodia to uphold its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol with regard to the prohibition of the refoulement of refugees. It will also encourage the Government of Cambodia to cooperate fully with the UNHCR in order to reach an agreement that will enable Cambodia to fulfil its obligations under the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0578"></a>

<p>(FR) Within the framework of the fifth framework research and technological development programme (1998-2002), no project for research on the human embryo has been funded. A very large number of projects involve, however, the use of animal embryos and in particular mouse embryos. The mouse is the most commonly used animal model for medical research.</p>
<p>With regard to Community research on embryonic stem cell lines, to date, 13 projects have been listed as using animal embryonic stem cell lines (more than 80% are embryonic stem cell lines from mice).</p>
<p>A single project has initially been identified at the time of evaluation as intending to use existing human embryonic stem cell lines (QLK3-2002-01777). The latest annual scientific reports received by the Commission reveal, however, the use of existing human embryonic stem cell lines in at least four additional projects. This demonstrates very clearly that the use of these lines by researchers is increasing. This would bring the number of projects using these lines to five. With regard to these four additional projects, an ethical review is going to be carried out within the context of the identification of new elements involved in projects underway and of an ethically sensitive nature. To this end, complementary information on the lines used is going to be requested from the respective coordinators as well as evidence that the national authorisations have been granted.</p>
<p>The total amount of the Community contribution for all these projects is around EUR 23 million. Of this amount, more than EUR 15 million only involve projects using animal lines, around EUR 6 million involve projects using both animal and human lines, and around EUR 2 million only involve projects using one or more human lines. On this point, it is important to note that, in fact, just a fraction of this sum, which is perhaps very variable depending on the project (and is sometimes very small), directly involves research on, or with, these lines, whether animal or human.</p>

<p>On Thursday 18 September 2003, a serious accident happened in Hérault, in the South of France. A lorry carrying a load of 12 000 litres of thioglycollic acid, produced by Atofina, overturned and fell into the Illouvre river where it runs alongside a winding stretch of RN (national road) 112 between St Pons de Thomières and St Chinian. The driver was seriously injured, and the vats split open, releasing the acid which, as well as polluting the river and surrounding environment, also caused 50 fire-fighters and 17 gendarmes to be hospitalised suffering from headaches, respiratory disturbances, itching and rashes. A deplorable aspect of this accident is that staff of the DDE (Departmental Equipment Directorate), present at the scene, did not have the same 'precautionary principle' applied to them. The load in question was, moreover, being transported between Mourenx, in the Pyrénées Atlantiques department near the Atlantic coast, and the Mediterranean port of Sète, along a section of road where 8 fatalities were recorded between 1995 and 2001, with yet others having occurred since, and where a number of lorries have shed their loads.</p>

<p>(FR) In the Accession Treaty, the Slovak Republic secured a transitional period in the competition field for the granting of state aid up to 2009 at the latest to one company (US Steel Kosice) in the steel sector, subject to certain conditions. These conditions include certain caps on the company’s production and sales. Another condition of the transitional arrangement is that the total amount of aid that can be granted until 2009 may not exceed US $ 500 million.</p>
<p>The Commission is carefully monitoring the respect of the commitments undertaken by Slovakia in this context.

The Commission reserves the right to use all appropriate measures as necessary in the light of further developments.</p>

For this reason, HIV/AIDS is a research priority under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and the budget devoted to this disease has been increased fourfold with respect to the previous Framework Programme.</p>
<p>Resistance to anti-HIV/AIDS drugs is a growing problem in the developed world. Under the Fifth Framework programme, the Commission has funded several research projects on HIV-drug resistance, including both basic aspects and epidemiological studies, with a budget over EUR 8 million. One of these projects (SPREAD, Strategy to Control Spread of HIV Drug Resistance, co-ordinated by Prof. Charles Boucher, NL) has recently published that the rate of HIV drug resistance in Europe is close to 10%. This project will continue to be funded by the Commission until December 2005. Other projects, like EuroSIDA (Clinical and Virological Outcome of European Patients Infected with HIV), CASCADE (Virological Characterisation of Primary HIV Infection) or PENTA (Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS), in close collaboration with United States’ experts, are following up patients and developing guidelines for their treatment, including drug resistance. Many of these projects are increasing their collaboration with researchers from Eastern Europe, where the HIV epidemic is growing sharply.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the study done in the Netherlands. This study focused on relations between exposure to low intensity fields of base stations used for GSM 900, GSM 1800 and UMTS (3<span class="sup">rd</span> generation) networks. An unexpected but small negative correlation between well-being and exposure to UMTS exposure was found. No such correlation was observed for exposure to GSM fields. A positive correlation between cognitive capabilities and exposure to GSM fields, also observed in other studies was confirmed. The study calls for an independent confirmation of its results and an extension of the study method.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently supporting under the 5<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (Quality of Life, Key Action 4: Environment and Health), a mix of studies in different research areas in order to evaluate potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields, including mobile communication technologies. This programme includes different types of studies in order to investigate distinct aspects of this issue. The total cost of the projects involved is more than EUR 32 million, with a Community contribution of over EUR 12 million. Included are four projects dealing with the possible carcinogenic effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF), one project on terahertz radiation related to medical imaging applications, and further two projects on possible effects on hearing and on possible biological effects and hazards due to exposure of brain and nerve cells to high frequency electromagnetic fields (GSM 900 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, UMTS). The results of all the above-mentioned studies will be available by end 2005.</p>
<p>In addition, under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme, the Commission is at the moment negotiating a contract for a Network of Excellence called EMF-NET aimed at improving the co-ordination of the results of the research activities related to the biological effects of electromagnetic fields. This network should also consider the potential risks related to occupational exposure. The EMF-NET Consortium involves all the co-ordinators of the Union (FP5) funded active projects, and of the main research projects at national level (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, United Kingdom). In addition it involves other international activities, such as the World Health Organisation EMF project and the COST 281 Action, associations of industries and manufactures, regulatory bodies, scientific association, and trade union associations. This network will also monitor emerging and third generation technologies, identifying the main needs in terms of co-ordination and studies. In this context, the study done in the Netherlands will certainly raise attention to the phenomena observed.</p>
<p>The REFLEX project has terminated at the end of August 2003 but the Commission is waiting for the final report of the project, which is due at the end of October. A summary of the final report will be made available to the public.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Article 14 of the Agreement between the Union and its Member States of the one hand and the Swiss Confederation of the other, on the free movement of persons, provides for the establishment of a Joint Committee composed of representatives of the Contracting Parties, each one designating its own representatives. The Community is represented by the Commission. Each time the Joint Committee meets, each contracting party informs the other on the composition of its own delegation. There are no persons designated to represent each contracting party for a given time period.</p>
<p>The duties of the Joint Committee (also spelled out in the same article 14 of the Agreement) is to be responsible for the management and proper application of the Agreement. To this end, it issues recommendations and takes decisions within the framework of the Agreement.</p>
<p>From a procedural point of view, prior to any decision being taken by the Joint Committee, the Council needs to approve a recommendation for the Community position with respect to such a proposed decision. Since the entry into force of the Agreement, the Joint Committee has met twice (July 2002 and July 2003) and has adopted two decisions. Decision 1/2003 adopted in June 2003, refers to the rules of procedure to which the question makes reference. The Commission can provide the Honourable Member with a copy of such Rules of procedure if he so wishes.</p>
<p>Each of the six agreements between the EU and Switzerland, namely on:</p>
<p> - air transport,</p>
<p> - carriage of goods and passengers by rail and road,</p>
<p> - trade in agricultural products,</p>
<p> - mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment,</p>
<p> - certain aspects of government procurement,</p>
<p> - scientific and technological cooperation,</p>
<p>which entered into force on 1<span class="sup">st</span> June 2002, contains an article establishing a Joint Committee. In the case of the Scientific and Technological cooperation Agreement, its functions are entrusted to an already existing committee (the Switzerland/Communities Research Committee established in the 1986 Agreement).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) In order to analyse all the direct and indirect implications of a reform of the current common organisation of the market, both in the production sector and in the sectors and regions dependent on it, the Commission has decided to carry out an in-depth impact study.</p>
<p>Within the context of this study, 14 Directorate-Generals have carried out in-depth analysis work and the issue of employment in tobacco-growing regions has been examined in detail in collaboration, in particular, with the Directorate-General responsible in that field. This issue has also been highlighted by the local elected representatives of the tobacco-producing areas at a forum which brought together representatives of all the interested parties, organised by the Commission within the context of drawing up the in-depth impact study.</p>
<p>The analytical tools available to the Commission, and in particular the FADN, demonstrate that the proposed decoupling of current aid for tobacco will not have a negative impact on the revenue of farms.</p>
<p>The productive reorganisation of tobacco farms, and particularly the abandonment of tobacco production by farms whose market receipts do not cover the variable costs of tobacco production, may have a negative impact on employment in the sectors involved in the tobacco economy during and after production.</p>
<p>The Commission is not, however, aware of the existence of any quantitative analytical instrument for evaluating the impact on employment in the tobacco-growing regions.</p>
<p>Despite this absence of precise quantification, the Commission recognises, however, the importance of this production to the economic survival of certain regions and wishes to prevent the negative impact on local employment of a modification of the current type of aid. This is why it has proposed that a proportion of the funding currently dedicated to direct aid to production should be transferred to a ‘restructuring’ envelope, intended to increase the current rural development funds for production regions and to promote the economic diversification of these regions with a view to guaranteeing the maintenance of jobs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0607"></a>

<p>Improving the structure for the fight against currency counterfeiting through creation of the appropriate services</p>
<p>Organising and co-organising training of staff (police, judicial, financial) in these countries with regard to techniques and procedures in the fight against currency counterfeiting</p>
<p>Developing further the co-operation through regular meetings between experts from these countries, experts of the Member States and the European institutions.</p>
<p>This allows the applicant countries to be brought up to the standards of the EU countries with regard to the protection of the euro.</p>

<p>The Commission would like to reply the Honourable Member that Europol does not gather information on the number of crimes committed by groups claiming to protect animal rights by carrying out raids on farms. The reason is that this type of crime is not included in the crimes for which Europol is competent according to the Convention of 1995 establishing Europol.</p>
<p>As regards the question if 'eco-terrorism' falls within the sphere of cross-border crime as referred to in Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union, the Commission would like to point out that the list of offences contained in that article is an indicative one (‘in particular’). Article 31(e) by contrast refers specifically to three categories of offences, among which terrorism and organised crime.</p>
<p>Concerning the question regarding the Framework Decision on combating terrorism, this was adopted on 13 June 2002 and Member States had to implement it in domestic legislation by 31 December 2002. The Commission is currently drafting a report on its implementation, which should be the basis of the Council assessment before the end of next year. The phenomenon described by the Honourable Member as ‘eco-terrorism’ would only fall under the scope of this Framework Decision provided it fulfilled the conditions laid down in its Article 1(1), namely when it may seriously damage a country or an international organisation and if it were committed with the aim of:</p>
<p>seriously intimidating a population, or</p>
<p>unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act, or</p>
<p>seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation.</p>
<p>The question as to whether or not the Framework Decision should be amended or complemented might be considered in view of the Commission's report, on the basis of a possible perceived lacuna.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0615"></a>

<p>(EN) Around 15 million new jobs will need to be created in the Union-15 if the Lisbon targets of a 70% employment rate by 2010 is to be achieved; 22 million new jobs for the Union-25.</p>
<p>This means in particular that more entrepreneurs are needed to generate more jobs. Self-employment in the Union has remained stable - at about 14% of the workforce - in recent years.</p>
<p>Self-employment is one of the possible expressions of ‘entrepreneurship’, a virtue that needs to be encouraged in Europe for its contribution to competitiveness, innovation in new goods and services, and adaptability in the face of restructuring and sectoral change. But entrepreneurship is not Europe's strong point. There are two main reasons for this.</p>
<p>The first one is ‘cultural’. European attitudes towards entrepreneurship are regularly examined in surveys and they show reluctance towards entrepreneurship among citizens. Europe's education and training systems must better value entrepreneurship and prepare students for careers as entrepreneurs. All students, whatever the branch they study, should get at least basic management skills. It is also essential to modify the perceived imbalance between the risks and the rewards associated with entrepreneurship; insolvency law, for instance, should not create excessive risks for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The other reason for lagging entrepreneurial dynamism is related to the framework conditions for enterprises to start up and expand. The time and costs involved in setting up a business, the administrative and regulatory burdens, the difficulties in accessing financial resources, particularly micro-funding, are all well known problems. Services which assist small- or medium-sized businesses to start up and survive are of critical importance in this respect.</p>
<p>A number of European initiatives and programmes are relevant for self-employment and entrepreneurship. Both the European Employment Guidelines and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines contain recommendations to Member States to support entrepreneurship through improvements in the business environment. The Action Plan on Risk Capital addresses the issue of access to finance. Their implementation is being closely monitored by the Commission.</p>
<p>A number of initiatives are taken in the framework of the Commission's Enterprise Policy. The ‘‘ among other things supports Member States’ efforts to improve their performance by learning from best practices, through projects carried out in selected policy areas under the Best Procedure. The European Charter for Small Enterprises demonstrates the Union's commitment to create the best possible environment for small business and entrepreneurship. To set a future agenda for entrepreneurship policy in Europe, the Commission recently issued the Green Paper ‘Entrepreneurship in Europe’. The discussions around this paper involved a wide number of stakeholders in defining the action needed to produce more entrepreneurs and to get more firms to grow. On the basis of this, the Commission is now preparing an Entrepreneurship Action Plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0617"></a>

<p>(FR) The Lisbon European Council established a very ambitious agenda for the Union with a view to 2010: to become the most competitive economy in the world, guaranteeing full employment and cohesion. The Gothenburg European Council added environment and sustainable development, thereby making up a global strategy aimed at strengthening and modernising the European development model.</p>
<p>The European Council in March is the annual opportunity to assess the progress made and to adopt new actions, on the basis of the report the Commission will adopt in January.</p>
<p>In its annual assessment, the Commission shares the Honourable Member’s concern with regard to the involvement of the Member States in the Lisbon agenda. Several elements are combined: the delay in the adoption of several outstanding proposals by the Council, the delay in the transposition period at Member State level, and finally the partial or ineffective implementation of the reforms adopted.</p>
<p>These elements are one of the main challenges for the Commission in 2004 and beyond if we are to see concrete results on the ground, for companies and for citizens.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently considering the content of the next spring report which it must adopt in January. The involvement of the Member States will certainly be in an important point in these considerations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0626"></a>

<p>Great concern has been caused in Greece by the introduction of personal biometric information recording on intra-Community flights, in particular, iris scans by the Alitalia airline at the Eleftherios Venizelos Airport, without the civil aviation's security service being apprised of this. These measures form part of the agreement between the EU and the USA to combat terrorism and have been taken in response to US demands for airlines to provide 39 items of biometric and other data.</p>
<p>What view does the Commission take of such measures? Who records the data? For how long is it kept and how is it used? Are such measures compatible with the need to protect and uphold the human rights of EU citizens and the Commission's contractual monitoring obligations in this respect?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission does not have information on the current use of biometric information by airlines with regard to intra-Community flights nor on any communication of that data to the United States. In any event, if such data is to be used by airlines, that use should conform to the Community legislation applicable in the field and in particular Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
