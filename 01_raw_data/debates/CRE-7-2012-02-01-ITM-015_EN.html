More often than not, making these changes is less risky and uncertain than not making them. Honourable Members will recall that we debated Russia in our Strasbourg session on 13 December 2011, and the concerns that were raised in this House about the Duma elections were raised with President Medvedev at our summit that followed shortly afterwards. You will recall that those concerns focused in particular on the exclusion of parties from the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">President Medvedev talked to us about those concerns and explained that a necessary political evolution was taking place. He said this was due to improved living standards, a more active civil society, and the development of social media, and he emphasised that the government was drawing lessons. Some limited political reforms have been launched, and yet the protests that began in December, we see, are set to continue. The movement has grown. We can expect a large mobilisation this coming Saturday, 4 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The announcement, made in tandem in September, that the President and Prime Minister will swap jobs again made many Russian citizens feel that things were being decided between just two people, over the heads of voters. There is a growing group of people calling for real participation, for more decisive measures to rein in corruption and impunity, and for more breathing space for democratic processes. They are ready to express these opinions peacefully. Nevertheless, they want to see real change; and OSCE observers have raised real issues about registration, about access to electronic media, and about the lack of separation between state and governing party. We are moving forward to engage in dialogue with the protestors and, of course, the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The next benchmark will be the presidential elections on 4 March 2012. We welcome the fact that an invitation has been extended again to the OSCE and others to observe these elections, but expectations will be higher this time. Regrettably, issues of registration have arisen again, in relation to the presidential elections. I call on the authorities responsible to review, as a matter of urgency, the decision not to register Grigory Yavlinsky. The Russian leadership should now act swiftly on the problems identified by the OSCE, and do its utmost in the short time left to hold free and fair presidential elections next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia and the EU face challenges also on the international scene. Recently, differences have emerged about how to deal with the growing crisis in Syria. With thousands of people killed and violence escalating across Syria, we strongly urge Russia to join the international consensus and allow the Security Council to act on the basis of the Arab League proposals and the joint draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Russia disagreed with the international community’s approach to Libya and said that the action taken went beyond the mandate given by the Security Council – I have discussed this with the Foreign Minister of Russia, Mr Lavrov, several times – but it is also clear that we cannot let the Syrian people pay the price for past disagreements. Syria is a specific case and the solution proposed by the Arab League is different from Resolution 1973. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia needs to take its responsibilities for international peace and security seriously. Old alliances may matter, but the fate of the people of Syria matters much more.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, experience suggests that we manage pretty well to find common ground on international affairs, be it in the Middle East Quartet or indeed in the E3+3 format on Iran. I meet often with Foreign Minister Lavrov and I was in Moscow in November.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran is of particular concern this year. As already discussed, the lack of progress in the talks has left us with no choice but to adopt our new round of sanctions, and I have discussed in this House this evening the purpose of those sanctions and how important it is that we work closely with the E3+3 and of course, in that context, with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention as well, in the context of our discussions on difficult issues, the important cooperation – however difficult – with Russia over Georgia and Moldova, which are both engaged in efforts to resolve protracted conflicts. As these examples show, we work intensively with Russia on international issues – albeit not without difficulty, but there is often a desire to find common ground and enable the international community to respond. It is our joint task to make sure that it responds on Syria and Iran this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is not only a strategic partner: it is also our largest neighbour. We share close historical, cultural, social and economic ties. The EU is Russia’s most important trading partner, and Russia is our third largest trading partner. Our last summit, in December 2011, proved that the EU’s Russia policy has produced good results recently: most importantly, the World Trade Organization accession and agreements on aviation issues, visas and the partnership for modernisation. Russia’s accession to the WTO will bring the last of the major economies under a global rules-based system. The launch of the common steps towards visa-free travel opens the prospect of visas being abolished, and there was consensus at the summit that we should reinvigorate negotiations on a new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the EU approach of constructive yet critical cooperation with Russia is bearing fruit. We will continue our support for modernising both Russia’s economic basis and the foundations for a dynamic society oriented towards the future. We are well prepared to support and encourage a domestic political process in Russia that aims to develop its democratic institutions and the rule of law, as well as a modern economy and a vibrant civil society, whose human rights are respected and whose aspirations for a more open and dynamic society are matched by the reforms undertaken by its government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope this will give us a good basis for our debate this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the article, Mr Putin states that today’s Russia is dominated by the state, that it suffers from serious corruption and that everything needs to change. That is good news for the citizens of Russia, as well as for us. Would it not be great indeed if it were possible to break through a failing culture and turn the country into a true democracy?</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, Mr President, what also struck me was that there was no mention in the article of people in Russian society. While there is a recognition that the market needs to be given new freedoms in order to generate new confidence, there is a complete and utter lack of any consideration of freedoms for people. A society where people are subordinated to the market, where people as individuals or collectively are denied fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms, will not function, despite all the fine words.</p>
<p class="contents">If Russia wants to be modern and prosperous there needs to be real work done there, twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, in order to properly tackle all the deficiencies in respect of freedom and there needs to be a real effort to get going in respect of working towards a true democracy. Mr President, we have seen – and Baroness Ashton has just said – that in the past the democratic rights of citizens were trampled on. We saw this with the <span class="italic">Duma</span> elections. We hope and expect that things will be different in the presidential elections, but the signs are not good.</p>
<p class="contents">What applies when it comes to human rights in Russia also applies to Russian influence beyond its borders. If the Russian regime is to be believed, it will refrain from using its veto irresponsibly and it will thus not protect the Syrian regime, nor actively support it with weapons to be used on people who are simply seeking their freedom. Mr President, we can now find out whether these were merely words, or also translated into deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They will make it clear whether the processes have been improved and whether we can hold out hope that there will be positive developments in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the many demonstrations that have taken place since the beginning of December make me very hopeful. They are an indication that civil society is gaining strength and, therefore, for me they are also a sign of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the large-scale demonstration due to take place on Saturday also highlights the problem faced by the Russian opposition and the protest movement. The so-called systemic opposition parties, which are represented in the Duma, are to a large extent not regarded by the population as being a viable democratic alternative. The inclusion of the nationalists in the protest movement is, thank goodness, giving rise to heated debate. I believe that we need to show solidarity in particular with those who have joined the White Ring protest over recent days and weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">These citizens come from a wide range of different areas of society and are taking action to protect their civil rights, without having an ideological axe to grind and, most importantly, without any kind of self-interest. They do not want to form a government. Instead, they want the right to freely elect a government. This makes the movement even more convincing.</p>
<p class="contents">What Russia most urgently needs are state institutions and elected officials who have democratic legitimacy and the trust of their voters and who make a clear commitment to serving the interests of the voters and to combating corruption and other abuses of power. Therefore, we must give this movement our support now and make it increasingly clear in our discussions with our Russian partners that we are happy to cooperate with them, but that we also want to see joint progress being made towards more democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who are members of the EU-Russia delegation will definitely be discussing this when we visit Moscow in eight weeks and it would be good if the Commission could play an active role in supporting the delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every time the European Parliament discusses the situation in Russia, its counterparts in Moscow express their discontent about foreigners getting involved in their domestic home affairs. Instead of considering our constructive criticism, the Russian authorities point to other issues of a completely different nature.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the Duma elections were neither free nor fair. The situation with the presidential elections is one of <span class="italic">déjà vu</span>. An absence of free media and the behaviour of the central electoral committee is depriving the electorate of the possibility of making a genuine choice. The demonstrations by Russian citizens show that people want free and fair elections. We need to applaud their efforts and the maturity of civil society in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempts of Prime Minister Putin and his court to preserve power will provoke instability that will endanger our partnership for modernisation: investors will not be attracted to corruption and the idea of Russians packing their bags and fleeing the regime does not match our expectations either.</p>
<p class="contents">Legitimacy of presidential power is crucial for the development of Russia, including for its status in international affairs. There are big question marks over its place in the G8 and other international fora, especially in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group is glad to have the EEAS, at least, in place, to coordinate our European policies towards Russia. With one voice we can, of course, achieve more.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs a stable and reliable partner. However, the recent statements by Mr Lavrov on Iran, for example, are not at all encouraging for further cooperation in the security field.

<p class="contents">The findings of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the election monitors from the Russian NGO Golos have shown that these elections were not free or fair. Since then Russian civil society, which we believed had sunk into apathy, has begun to take action. A growing protest movement has emerged, which is fuelled by self-respect. It is calling for an honest Russia that will no longer tolerate paternalistic rule. It is also demanding the annulment of the Duma elections, the removal from office of the head of the central electoral commission, new elections under the terms of the new election act promised by Mr Medvedev for 2013 and, most importantly, free, fair and correct presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps what we are seeing in Russia is what we had hoped very much would emerge from the Arab Spring and which is now regarded with scepticism: a genuine democratic new beginning, the birth of a civil society. The poet Dmitrii Bykov described the situation very aptly during the big demonstration on 24 December when he said that life with all its dangers and risks is awaiting a newborn baby, but the baby has now been born and he cannot be pushed back into the womb.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s controlled democracy is escaping from state control. If, as some people say, it really were a sovereign democracy and not a stage-managed one, no one would need to be afraid of genuine elections, because the elected government would be able to rely on sovereign power.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said that Mr Putin wants economic competition, as he recently explained, because he has been forced to acknowledge that, without competition, the rule of law and the fight against corruption, it will not be possible to modernise Russian society and to develop a healthy SME sector. However, this also applies to the regeneration of society, which will not be able to make progress without political competition and debate and this has been gradually blocked since Mr Putin took power.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the crippling social contract which is based on the principle of ‘you let us live and we will let you govern’ has now been terminated. Civil society is taking back its political rights. After fighting for the right of freedom of assembly, next Saturday the protest movement will begin its struggle for the right to demonstrate. It will be 22 years since the memorable date of 4 February 1990, when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Moscow to call for the removal of the article in the constitution which enshrined the leading role of the communist party.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the demonstrations are against the Kremlin’s monopoly of power and in favour of the separation of powers. They are about the choice between Russia as an alternative power on the basis of its raw materials, together with Putin’s ‘power vertical’ involving the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), and a democratic, pluralist, knowledge, information and market society which has an open relationship with the EU. The question is whether given all our efforts to establish a relationship, our willingness to cooperate and our modernisation partnership, we will be able to bring about a real partnership based on values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Vladimir Putin knows that we like the word ‘corruption’, and he also knows that if there is to be a fight against corruption, it will be something new. We are behaving a little like children: we are looking around just trying to find instances of corruption, as if we were not paying attention to what has been going on in Russia recently or to the mistakes which, often in good faith, we ourselves have made. What were the two mistakes which we should remind ourselves of today? The first was the application of double standards. We have been using double standards in the belief that we will somehow calm the situation down. Today, these double standards can apply to energy, for example, because it is being said that Gazprom may be granted a partial exemption from the principles of the third energy package. By the way, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you, Baroness Ashton, if there is a chance that this will happen, and I wonder how you evaluate Gazprom’s proposals? They are very important. We should not, today, be sending a signal that we are willing to use double standards, because then the entire third energy package is pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing is the myth of stabilisation. Today, when there are young Russians on the streets, we know they will not gain power, but we have made a mistake in relation to many countries when we have talked about stabilisation for the sake of peace and quiet. Today we have to address ourselves to these groups, to young people, and therefore the signing of the agreement on local border traffic between the Kaliningrad oblast and Poland was a good move. It was a good move – leading the way to relaxation of the visa regime. Let us move in this direction, Baroness Ashton. Let us not forget these two lessons: let us never again employ double standards or the logic of stabilisation. We must concentrate on development, youth and the future. This will bring results both to Russia and to the Member States of the European Union. This is what I wish you today, Baroness Ashton. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This figure has not only halved, but is also particularly low in areas which are in close contact with the EU.

<p class="contents">The fact that the state bureaucracy is reviewing the discrepancies reported by the opposition, and that the state is respecting the protests of opposition forces shows that Russia is moving towards a better balance of political forces, and that the opposition today can reach far more people than in the past. Nobody who takes a realistic view of political relations in Russia expects that the stronger voice of the opposition puts at risk the success of Vladimir Putin in the March presidential elections.

Unlike in the Arab States, the protesters are not students who have brought about a rapid radicalisation of the movements, but the Russian middle class. In addition, the protest movement does not have any well-known political leaders. Last but not least, the opposition is often not aimed directly at Putin, but at corrupt local authorities. If Putin does not make any more big mistakes, he will be re-elected as president, as surely as night follows day.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Russia obviously has a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to democracy and human rights. That is not surprising when you think of the major problems which Russia has to overcome as a result of its 70-year communist history. Nevertheless, we are seeing some progress and some compromises, for example in the legislation on political parties and the fight against corruption. The EU itself is not perfect. We also have democratic deficits. Freedom of speech is constantly being put at risk here. Pressure is being exerted on the media in the EU as well. Therefore, Brussels should not always take it upon itself to lecture others about democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This concerns both the situation inside Russia and what we call democracy, and also Russia in its external relations and foreign policy, because of course Russia does have what are said to be democratic institutions, elections and a parliament, and there are political parties which do appear to compete with each other, but at the same time we must not forget the fact – and it is to be welcomed that we do talk about this fairly often in this Chamber – that Russia is still a country in which journalists disappear, in which unjust sentences are handed down, and in which political opponents are persecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">In its foreign policy Russia is also a country which on the one hand supports our actions – the work of NATO, the United States and the European Union in Afghanistan – but on the other hand is supporting Syria and is behaving on this matter in a scandalous manner, and is even working against what is being said by the Arab states. It remains, therefore, to ask where is that hope? There is hope now only in the Russian nation.

<p class="contents">The prospect of doubling the European Union-Russia trade in the next 5-10 years is, however, conditioned by the modernisation of the Russian economy and by the full assumption of a real democratic framework. The EU-Russia partnership is conditioned by compliance with democratic values and rules. Therefore, we are concerned with the fairness of presidential elections this year, in particular in the context of the protests that followed the parliamentary elections in December. The screening on Sunday of the opposition leader on the official TV channels, for the first time after so many years of censorship, is an encouraging sign that all candidates will have unrestricted access to mass media. However, this first broadcast also demonstrates the democratic deficit affecting Russian society. That is why the electoral process is not a guarantee for democracy, except to the extent to which the elections will not be flawed, including the electoral campaign stage.</p>

<p class="contents">What we say in our official statements in relation to Russia is very modest. I do not think it really reflects the attitudes of Russians. On my recent visits to Russia I found really very deep discontent with the decline in democracy in that very important country. There is corruption, and there is a clear failure of the democratic process. This so-called ‘managed democracy’ might be acceptable in Egypt, where my friend Ayman Nour has been prevented from standing as a candidate in the presidential elections, but it is wholly ridiculous that Grigory Yavlinsky has been banned from standing as a presidential candidate in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to what we do, apart from making clearer statements criticising the failure of democracy in Russia, I would pay tribute to the Commission and the EAS for increasing the budget for the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights by 34% in response to the Arab Spring, and I hope that we can focus quite a lot of that effort on Russia itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems of which you also spoke need to be resisted – the problems with registration of particular candidates and with the rights which are being violated. This is because, as the European Union and as Europeans or as citizens of the European Union’s Member States, we do not have the right to decide who Russians vote for, but on the other hand we do have a duty as Europeans to create conditions of party rivalry and political rivalry in Russia which ensure that everyone has an equal chance, and I am going to give you my sincere encouragement to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of making constant recommendations to Russia, we should think about how rapidly we ourselves manage to resolve the crisis-related, fundamental problems of the Union. We should also reflect on the fact that Russia is gradually changing. I have known it for decades, and not just from visits of a few hours and prepared meetings with selected partners. I know it well from the perspective of the people living in Russia. I have worked there. I know that it is very far from being a paradise on earth.

In the second programme, Tony Blair’s former aide Jonathan Powell recounts the famous ‘spy rock’ scandal story. The Kremlin had accused MI6 of funding Russian human rights groups and other NGOs and using a fake rock located in a Moscow square filled with electronic equipment to communicate with their secret agents. Mr Powell confirmed this story (whether it is true or not), and the BBC elevated it to the status of a scoop by issuing a press release.</p>
<p class="contents">The FSB reacted promptly, publicly accusing two leading NGOs – Memorial and Golos – of being subversive and extremist organisations funded by the West. Both organisations are now under systematic harassment by the authorities. Powell’s claim is either untrue or illegal under the Official Secrets Act.

It goes without saying that Russia could play a very different role to the one it is currently playing with regard to Iran – right now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies with regard to Syria. It is unreasonable for Russia to be allowed to act in an underhand way, as it is doing where Syria is concerned.

<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we should talk about how corrupt – at least to a certain extent – the Duma elections were. We should have high expectations ahead of the presidential elections, of course, but it is without doubt deplorable that one of the countries of the Security Council should have a right of veto and then be able to behave the way Russia is doing in terms of its foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself come from a country that was for many long years under the influence of the Soviet Union – the predecessor of the Russian Federation. It would be very wrong to say today that nothing has happened in the Russian Federation in terms of political reforms. The Russian Federation today is different from the country we knew in previous times. It would also be wrong, however, for us to say that the reforms to date are sufficient and that we have no interest in monitoring further developments and the further progress of political reforms in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">We should think very carefully, however, and modify the tone that we adopt in such a discussion. Baroness Ashton mentioned that we had a major debate on the Russian Federation in the European Parliament's part-session in mid-December. Less than two months have passed and we are again discussing the Russian Federation in the European Parliament's plenary. Imagine how often the situation in the EU is debated in the Russian Duma, and how often there is criticism in the Russian Duma of the corruption in EU Member States. We issue calls every other month for the Russian Federation to combat corruption. Where there are proven cases, let them be handled under the applicable regulations and laws which exist in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel, however, that if we want to be critics, then our criticism should be objective, and if our criticism is objective, then we should also criticise corruption in our own Member States. If we criticise the fact that in Russia the opposition has no room to move, let us take a look at Romania. Does the opposition in Romania have room to move? This is a Member State of the EU. If we are talking about the dominance of a single large party, let us take a look at Hungary. Hungary is also dominated by a single large party, and we have also criticised here many times what is happening in this Member State of the EU.

The human rights situation in Russia is very alarming. The Duma elections were a cynical example of how indifferent Russia’s authorities are to international standards. These standards were infringed more than in the past, but the protests in which tens of thousands of Russians participated did not evoke a response. We must confirm that we can hear the cries of the Russian people just as we heard the ‘Arab Spring’. Words alone will not help Russia to become democratic, if its authorities have no desire at all for this to happen. We must be done with double standards and stop turning a blind eye merely because Russia is a country that is large and rich in raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s increased interference in the internal politics of European Union states is alarming, and confirms that imperial ideas still hold sway. In October last year Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiated a new strategy to increase its influence in European Union Member States, firstly by attaining official-language status for Russian in the European Union. Back in November, the National Bolsheviks began collecting signatures in Latvia for a referendum on Russian as the country’s second official language, and this year the absurd project began for collecting signatures within the framework of a citizens’ initiative to achieve recognition of Russian as an official language in the European Union. For Latvia, where during the occupation the number of so-called russophones increased from 8% before the occupation to approximately 44% following it, the introduction of a second official language would mean the destruction of the Latvian language and consequently of the Latvian State. Russia’s wish to influence European Union policy is much more profound than we often believe it to be, and for that reason, Baroness Ashton, I call upon you too to turn your attention to it, since its consequences are likely to be extremely significant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As for the elections on 4 March, in the eyes of the governing elite the result has obviously been decided, in so far as Mr Medvedev’s interlude will soon be over. In the view of foreign observers there is no real chance for credible decision-making, because the December elections were assessed as neither fair nor free. The convergence of the state and the governing elite has resulted in massive rigging and manipulations. Sergei Kolesnikov, Putin’s former ally, told us in December that Putin will stop at nothing to retain power.</p>
<p class="contents">There remains the question of the behaviour of the Russian voters. Here a real change has been taking place since December: a change of attitudes, mentality and hopes. Anna Politkovskaya’s warning more than six years ago of limitless political apathy among Russian voters has finally been heeded, and the result has been massive interest in monitoring and participation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU now has a unique chance to influence the situation in a positive way, and I think the best way to do this is to follow the suggestions in Sir Graham Watson’s report, to be adopted tomorrow, about consistency towards authoritarian regimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, it can be clearly seen that the policy which has been pursued for many years – a policy of engagement of the European Union in relations with Russia, which was to lead to the modernisation and democratisation of Russia – has simply failed. The recent parliamentary elections were falsified, and in the forthcoming presidential elections the same candidate is going to stand for a third time – something which is unthinkable in Europe, although it is in accordance with the Russian Constitution. There is absolutely no cooperation, and, quite the contrary, there is support for regimes such as those in Syria and Belarus, there is corruption, and there is absolutely no competitiveness in the Russian economy, in which large state concerns dominate small and medium-sized enterprises. What more is needed for us to conclude that we need to draw up a new, more realistic policy on Russia?</p>
<p class="contents">There is one hope, and it is with this that I should like to close my speech. There is hope to be found in the Russian democrats who have stirred themselves, there is hope in the emerging middle class, there is hope in these people, and we should not be looking to our policy today for some kind of positive solution in Russia.

<p class="contents">A number of Members talked about a moment of hope for change. We have seen that the Russian leadership, at least in theory, has acknowledged the need for change. As I said at the beginning of my contribution, we know it is the least risky option, if I can put it like that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of work and many reforms ahead. The different concerns that have been expressed in the House are enormously significant. We share that concern and indeed raise it with Russia. We want to work with Russia as partners on many of the issues that have been raised, including, by the way, in the context of our new agreement, which a number of colleagues mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to comment on some of the specific issues that have been raised. I will refer to particular points made by individual Members, but that is not to fail to reflect the broader consensus. Mr Fleckenstein talked about the need to see that voters are given unrestricted choice. That is why registration is such an important issue. As you said in your contribution, Sir Graham, the registration rules are disproportionate. We understand that the President of the Central Election Committee is going to have to explain himself in the Duma, and there are questions there which we need to come back to and which we will continue to raise with Russia. We are following matters and talking with the demonstrators and with the opposition via our delegation. Helga Schmidt, whom I mentioned earlier, was in Moscow until today, and has been meeting with them on my behalf over the last couple of days.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of colleagues also raised the issue of the third energy package. Mr Kowal, I would say that it shows how important our market is that Russia spends so much time lobbying on this. It depends greatly on the EU market, and that is extremely important in our relationship with Russia. I agree that opinion is shifting and that the new President will need to think about how he governs differently. That is a significant part of many of the contributions that have been made concerning where Russia is going, the demands that people have for change and, in a sense, the atmosphere. A number of you described your visits to Russia and talks with individuals about how things are beginning to change. The policy that we are trying to develop is a good one, but it requires us to look at Russia from a bilateral set of relationships, as international partners on many things, and at the responsibilities that we have together in the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Russian civil society is very important, but I would say to those who have raised this issue that the relationship between this Parliament and civil society is also extremely valuable. Many times in the course of our deliberations about what has happened in North Africa, in what is now called the Arab Spring or the Arab uprising, I have raised the fact that Members of Parliament are critically important in explaining and discussing with people the value and importance of democracy, what it can bring and how to engage with it. I do hope that will continue. Mr Batten, the important point you make for me is that Golos and Memorial should be allowed to work freely and I agree with you on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree too on the importance of the bigger picture, and also of the smaller details, and that we need to have the tough discussions with Russia that Mr Svensson talked about. We also know that there is a great deal of interest in the European Union. I accept that maybe the Duma does not discuss us, Ms Flašíková, but we do know that there is a lot of interest in the EU from the Russian people and from Ministers and officials. The Eurasian Union, which is much talked about now and which I discussed with Deputy Prime Minister Shuvalov when I was there in November, is in a sense inspired by the way that the European Union works.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Vaidere, I know very well the concerns in Latvia about the language issue and I know that it is very sensitive, but I am quite sure that the Latvian authorities will handle this well.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this has been an important debate as we continue to try to develop the relationship with Russia. On the one hand, we see the advantages now within the World Trade Organization and the capacity we have to develop those trade relationships; we see a more active civil society with which we can engage – we can use the tools that we have to try to engage further; we see the need to continue to press on some of the basic issues that have been quite rightly raised here about the way that the internal situation in Russia is developing. Then there is Russia as an international player with whom we work on issues such as Iran. We are increasingly trying to work with it on Syria and on other areas where working together in the Security Council and the importance of collaboration really come to the fore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliamentary elections in December resulted in unprecedented protests in Moscow and other important cities. We do not know exactly whether any fraud was involved. However, it is clear that Prime Minister Putin’s party was favoured, and the opposition greatly disadvantaged. There was a disproportion of means, of access to media, and of treatment on the part of state institutions. Presidential elections will follow. It is legitimate to make sure, through means that are also recognised by the Russian Federation, that they will be run correctly and all candidates will be treated equally. Guided democracy, which is in force in Russia, is a concept that is incompatible with the European Union’s founding values. I believe that it is in the interest of the Russian Federation to conduct the future elections fairly. This is the best way of increasing mutual trust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also goes without saying that 70 years of Soviet rule have left their mark. Russia is constantly being reprimanded by the EU, without the EU itself setting a good example. The malicious campaign launched by those on the left against the Hungarian Government is just one instance of how ‘seriously’ people in Europe really take democracy and freedom of speech. Patriotic movements which try to go against the Brussels mainstream regularly become victims of hate campaigns in the political arena and the media. We should not therefore be pointing the finger at others. Because of our mutual interests in the field of energy, the EU should ensure that large companies like Gazprom comply with the competition rules on the energy market. On the other hand, we should not be disregarding Moscow’s interests in the post-Soviet market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In respect of economic reform even China managed to overtake Russia, which is reflected in the 10-year difference between the two countries’ joining the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian leadership must urgently initiate comprehensive economic and political reforms. It must restore the freedom of the political institutional system and the press. In order to stimulate growth it must launch comprehensive economic reforms. It must reinforce the rule of law and curb corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s example, too, demonstrates how detrimental it can be if a single political force obtains excessive power and a constitutional majority, and eliminates the checks and balances of power. The European Union should step up against such practices both outside and within its borders. The protests that followed the Russian elections and have been ongoing for two months now have revealed the crisis of the Russian political system, which manifests itself on multiple levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The political capital of the Putin-Medvedev tandem heading the country has run out and the support of these two politicians has significantly diminished. Their peculiar controlled democracy, which made the operation of parties conditional on support from the executive power in order to ensure political stability, has also come to a dead end. This system aligned the electoral law to the expectations of the persons leading the country, and restricted the freedom of the press, as well as the free exercise of the right of assembly and the right of association. This could also serve as a warning to the authoritarian politics emerging in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These concerns are due to the last elections to the Duma, which saw an enormous number of violations of the rule of law and the process of free elections. The demonstrations that have been taking place show that Russian society wants change and reform, and that the deprivation of certain liberties will no longer be accepted as it was in the past. Moreover, there is the fear that this will merely consist of swapping posts and not of true democratic elections, based on a real choice. At the same time, Russia should meet its responsibilities in the international arena, in particular in the UN Security Council, in order to avoid a lack of response from multilateral institutions to situations like the human rights violations in Syria. I await the Russian presidential elections with interest, in the hope that the democratic process will genuinely be consolidated, as this country is a strategic partner and neighbour of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
