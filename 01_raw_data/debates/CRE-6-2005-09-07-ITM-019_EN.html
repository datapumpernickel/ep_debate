<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Luís Queiró (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, during times of economic difficulty we all have a responsibility to seek solutions, and to find ways of promoting progress and development. This is the background to our report on the future of sustainable tourism in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about tourism in the EU, we are talking about one of our largest and most competitive industries, one that generates the highest number of jobs and that has the biggest growth potential, even in the context of a Europe suffering from economic slowdown. The bottom line, however, is that this is an activity that needs to ensure its sustainability in such a way that it does not destroy, among other things, its environmental resources, its landscape resources and its regional planning.</p>
<p class="contents">We must seek to address one of the biggest difficulties facing the tourist industry in terms of economic efficiency: how can we combat the effects of seasonal variations on jobs and on the quality of services provided? Our report puts forward guidelines and proposals for solving these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a broad overview of an economic sector with massive potential, from which we must try to derive maximum benefit, by promoting synergies, developing cooperation and enjoying the benefits of shared experience. At the same time, it should be understood that tourism is first and foremost a sector in which private initiative prevails and in which, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, policies come mainly from the Member States’ authorities. This does not affect the Commission’s role of improving the consistency of its tourism-related measures with the Community policies that feed into it, such as transport, jobs, the environment and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the Lisbon Strategy, tourism is increasingly linked to new technology. It has turned the Internet into much more than merely an outlet for the sale of holidays – rather, it has become a key tool for use in the tourism sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we must decide how the Community institutions can support the measures taken by the Member States and the industry aimed at developing tourism. The way to do this, to my mind, is to take practical steps that can help to improve these measures at European level and can enable us to be proactive in promoting the old continent’s tourist destinations.</p>
<p class="contents">The most symbolic proposal on the table is, without question, that of creating outstanding European tourist destinations, along the lines of the European Capital of Culture concept. Also worthy of note is the proposal to set up a Community classification of tourist services, on a voluntary basis and with the industry’s cooperation, to be used in particular for the classification of hotel and restaurant facilities. The purpose of this scheme is to guarantee a more transparent service, and to protect consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have proposed a registered designation of origin for non-food craft products. We also support the creation and development of the European Tourism Portal to which all national portals will be linked; after all, we must not overlook the enormous benefits that this tool could bring in terms of publicising European destinations. In order to meet the need to increase employment, training and skills in the field of tourism, our proposal is to set up a network of specialised training in tourism. In the area of security, we have proposed that a contact group be set up with a view to coordinating information on how to manage crises, such as health crises and acts of terrorism, so as to ensure a rapid response in the event of European tourists needing protection and to support tourist operators affected by such events.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to improving tourist facilities, we have put forward a range of initiatives to improve access for people with reduced mobility and to ensure that those working in tourist services receive special training for this purpose. We have stressed the need to implement new tourist activities and infrastructure to cater for the growing demand among the elderly, who, in the coming decades, will account for over 30% of the population of developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of business competitiveness, we have highlighted the need to maintain the competitive position of operators established in the EU in relation to third country operators for tax purposes, an issue that, I was pleased to note, was resolved this morning with the vote on the Becsey report. Provision has also been made for applying reduced VAT rates for certain services, along the lines of those in place for other services.</p>
<p class="contents">We also endorse the proposal to create a ‘European Union’ tourism mark, characterised by the tremendous social and cultural diversity, high quality services and sustainable tourist projects in the EU, to be promoted via a suitable publicity campaign aimed at potential visitors from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in the area of transport, we have advocated the importance of investing in quality, by boosting the capacity and improving the accessibility of the various means of transport, by using integrated ticket offices to simplify ticketing systems and by establishing suitable links with air transport, which is the main form of tourist transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should finally like to address the question of Community funding. Given that tourism is an essential sector for regional and local development, it should be placed at the forefront of the Structural Funds. This break in the talks on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 could and should present us with an opportunity to reintroduce the issue via the creation of a separate budget heading.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this should be done in order to ensure that European regulations are flexible and in line with what is required. The work of operators will be made easier and they will be able to continue to offer high quality, sustainable services at an accessible price.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe in which private initiative is at the forefront of growth and development, our role as public decision-makers is to support it and to ensure that it is an integral part of a journey that will hopefully be laden with success.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I should like to thank all of those people who contributed towards this report with their amendments and their votes in committee, including, of course, Members of the Committee on Regional Development, Culture and Education. I hope that the debate that is about to get underway will match the quality of their contributions and the efforts that all of them put in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important that the European Parliament should keep revisiting this issue if it is not to be overshadowed by others in Europe, and that that state of affairs must prevail no longer.</p>
<p class="contents">When I speculate as to which sectors of the European economy might, in the years to come, make an outstanding contribution to growth and the creation of jobs, tourism is the first that springs to mind. It is evident to all of us that this is an enormous market, with potential for growth, and that Europe needs to be able to maintain its leading position in it, but there are plenty of problems to contend with. We face increasing competition, and foreign tourism is influenced by more and more factors, ranging from the environment to transport problems, not forgetting issues of home security. What is called for, then, is an integrated policy of reviewing all the responsibilities and competences that we have in terms of how we can use the options available to us in such a way as to create the ideal conditions for tourism to flourish in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said on several occasions, this is a topic to which I attach an extraordinarily high degree of importance. Even though tourism is a field in which the Commission’s powers are not great, I do believe that there is much that we can do as part of the European Union’s growth and employment policy – that is to say, as part of the Lisbon Strategy – to support Europe’s tourist areas in their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the character of tourism will change considerably over the coming decades, particularly in view of population changes in Europe. It will have to take far greater account of senior citizens’ mobility needs, pay a great deal more attention to public safety issues and be far more aware of the need to protect our cultural and natural heritage than it has been in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism, in Europe, is not one sector among many; it has become a factor of people’s quality of life, and we have to take that seriously. The Commission is very definitely willing to cooperate with your House in every conceivable way in order to bring about the right sort of change in European tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, then, to conclude by saying something that may appear rather surprising. Europe is the world’s leading tourist region; it is the most attractive tourist destination not only for its own tourists, but also for those from other parts of the world. That is capital with which we can work, and the Commission is ready and willing to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to observe that his report contains the greater part of the recommendations I had addressed to him as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. I do not wish to go back over the difficulties encountered by the tourism sector in Europe and the challenges it has to face, since that has been thoroughly debated in committee, and Mr Queiró presents an altogether clear overview of this issue. Furthermore, I believe that we have all understood the role that tourism can play in terms of growth, job creation and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to look to the future by emphasising three points, which I do not believe can be ignored. First, it seems crucial to me that the Commission and the Council should revive the work on the proposal for a directive concerning reduced rates of VAT by also enabling all the Member States to opt for a reduced rate of VAT for costs pertaining to the hotel and catering industries. The wide variety of situations within the European Union itself is leading to unfair competition, and that is no longer acceptable. Secondly, I believe that it is altogether desirable to encourage the development of new types of sustainable tourism such as agritourism, rambling, bicycle touring, horse riding and so on and to remove the obstacles encountered by certain sections of the community that wish to travel but that experience difficulties in doing so owing to the absence of infrastructures and amenities. Mr Queiró and Mr Verheugen have spoken about this. I am referring in particular to elderly people and people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my third point is that particular attention must be paid to regions suffering from natural and structural disadvantages: I am referring to the outermost regions and the island regions. With regard to these regions, we must implement an across-the-board policy, designed to encourage and promote these destinations, the greater part of whose economic activity consists of tourism, and thus encourage the development of an essential transport network servicing these isolated regions. The Commission could also provide for greater coherence between actions carried out to promote tourism and other related Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by pointing out that tourism still has no legal basis whatsoever in Community legislation, which is a state of affairs that I deplore. Let us hope that the progress contained in the draft Constitution will be resumed very soon indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This was reflected in the opinion the Committee submitted to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which highlighted a number of issues in particular. These included the need to focus on the various aspects of sustainable tourism, including economic, cultural, nature-related and social aspects, and the need to acknowledge the importance of seasonal tourism. The opinion stressed that the development of tourism should go hand in hand with the protection of national, regional and local culture and with the protection of the natural environment, parks, landscapes, urban structures and architectural sites and buildings. It underlined the importance of tourism for economic development, job creation and the maintenance of individual physical and mental health, as well as stressing the need for the proper management of tourist resources. It supported the development of agrotourism, particularly in the new Member States, and the education of younger generations in the fields of nature, culture, science and active leisure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted the majority of these proposals and incorporated them into the final version of the motion for a resolution. The end result is a fascinating document that gives due consideration to timeless values such as culture, nature and man’s natural environment, while prioritising organisational and economic issues.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the motion for a resolution either makes no reference or fails to give due weight to issues such as special-interest tourism, the protection of historic towns and architectural sites and buildings and the International Cultural Tourism Charter. It will be necessary to devote more attention to such issues during future work on the sustainable development of tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Verheugen quite rightly pointed out that the rapporteur was right to describe tourism as something that can create jobs, for which it has enormous potential, but I would ask him to admit that tourism is a field that the Commission has neglected up to now. It is for that reason that I hope that he has read the report’s demands and will later tell us which of them he endorses.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me list five things that are called for: the first is an international advertising campaign to attract more tourists from third states to Europe, one that would have to form part of a support package for tourism and be mounted in consultation with the tourist industry. The EU’s embassies overseas can help with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order for consumers to be better protected and informed, there is a need for the classification of hotel and restaurant standards to be standardised across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe there to be a need for the uniform application of VAT at the reduced rate to restaurant services in all the Member States; this is not something that should be done in different ways in different places.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, national holidays need to be synchronised in order to avoid traffic jams on motorways and overloading of holiday destinations.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs – and this is my fifth point – to be better coordination of emergency plans between state and private organisations at both the national and European levels, to give tourist protection in the event of natural disasters and against health risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are just five points that I have picked out of Mr Queiró’s wide-ranging report. Fine words butter no parsnips, as they say; it is no use saying that we will promote tourism and that the Commission is right behind the idea if nothing ends up happening, so, Commissioner, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us something about all the initiatives by the Commission that you intend to support. It is you who have the powers, the Commission that can work within the framework of the industrial policy, it is you who can work within the framework of regional policy, and there are many powers and responsibilities that you can combine for the benefit of tourism, so, Commissioner, I ask you to do something about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, my request is the same as the one that Mr Jarzembowski addressed to you just now. This own-initiative report has brought to the attention of Parliament and the European institutions the importance of a sector of the economy that is extremely significant, as you yourself have acknowledged, in terms of employment and production of the gross domestic product. It is also now in a position to grow in the wake of enlargement, and it can provide further jobs. Questions need to be answered, however, about implementation methods, the legislation to be used, funding, and the commitment of all the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report states, and I agree with it, that, in addition to what the private sector and the Member States must do, Community intervention must involve promoting integrated and hence sustainable socioeconomic and environmental policies. That is the key point, Commissioner, which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must also promote innovation through novel measures. In fact, tourism, which has until now been funded indirectly and in various ways by the European Union, has all too often remained merely a way of consuming land. Faced with worldwide competition from other holiday destinations at prices that are now competitive, it is no longer enough to use sporadic European funding to alleviate the adverse effects of inept policies and land consumption. It is not enough to protect the environment: we have to make a quantum leap and promote a different model of sustainable use that aims at quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Creating a suitable environment for businesses, which falls within Europe’s remit, as also defined in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, is a goal that should be pursued by encouraging the tourist industry to evolve towards making integral use of the country, as a driving force for local development. Tourism also requires the strengthening of the internal market, the gradual establishment of equality of treatment among operators, a Community-wide classification of facilities, and harmonised roles and professional profiles. We should aim at creating a ‘destination Europe’ that provides added value, promotes the richness of our cultural diversity and helps us to develop a European brand.</p>
<p class="contents">The European portal may be the first – and necessary – measure. It is both right and important to finance pilot projects that can become models of good practice, but that requires the identification of a relevant budget line as well as a stronger, more explicit political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobility and passenger safety are a necessary condition if our goals of growth, cohesion and convergence are to be met through the tourist industry as well. That is why we Socialists have tabled a few amendments that make this need more explicit, and I hope this House will adopt them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Mayor and President of the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bilbao, I placed a lot of faith in the theories of a respected professor of marketing, Philip Kotler. He is the author of several publications, of which my favourite is entitled <span class="italic">The Marketing of Nations</span>. In it, Kotler says that a country, region or city that wants to offer its citizens opportunities for progress and well-being must pursue three equally important great objectives, namely to sell the goods it produces to the outside, to attract investments and to attract tourism. Tourism is understood to mean not just leisure tourism, but also business, educational, scientific, sporting, and cultural tourism, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, my city has famously increased its income <span class="italic">per capita</span> as a result of the considerable increase in tourism resulting from its urban transformation. Bilbao has become a centre for services, trade, business and culture within its industrial hinterland.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to remind you of the important contribution of tourism, which provides 4% of the European Union’s GDP, nor of the seven million direct jobs generated by more than two million companies, the vast majority of which are small or medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to say to you that I openly reiterate my support for the proposal to create an adequate budget line within the Union’s budget to support the tourism sector, as well as the other requests or amendments introduced into the original text by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I have in mind the reduced rate of VAT for restaurants, improving the professional training of workers, the introduction of a European classification of tourist services and strengthening the rights of tourists and their protection as consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is one aspect included in the wonderful report by Mr Luis Queiró that I would like to stress. I am referring to transport as a necessary support to guarantee the mobility and the journeys of the millions of citizens who make up the base of tourism. In particular I would like to draw attention to the trans-European road transport networks. Every summer or holiday period these become jammed with kilometres of tail-backs of thousands of lorries and cars that have to stop repeatedly because of the excessive number of motorway toll points along a particular route.</p>
<p class="contents">We frequently experience one example of this inefficiency at the Viriatu pass between Spain and France, where there are five toll stations within a stretch of 50 kilometres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I now want to concentrate on just one aspect of it, namely sustainability – to which the title of this report refers – and particularly to the dependence of successful and long-term foreign tourism on sustainable transport. No other sector of the economy is as dependent on the environment as tourism. Beautiful landscapes, well-kept villages, clean air, peace and quiet, good and healthy food, among other things, are the tourist industry’s real capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism and transport are closely connected, but, in many tourist areas, the means of transport are so inappropriate that we are slowly but surely wrecking the foundation of a sustainable economy. For example, the perversity of the way in which mass tourism has developed is apparent in many places from the gridlock that occurs on Saturdays in high season as tourists all arrive and depart at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">This report endorses the idea of further development of air travel, which is the worst form of transport from the point of view of energy consumption and damage to the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second worst is the use of private motor vehicles. Railways, once much-loved, which played a substantial part in the first flourishing of tourism in the Alps some 100 years ago, are now generally forgotten, neglected and put at a disadvantage. If you are a tourist and want to go on holiday using public transport, it is an unfortunate fact that you will often find that, in many of the regions you want to visit, it is quite impossible to be properly mobile without a motor car. The main causes of this are the inadequacy of the public local transport on offer and the failure of many railway operators to make sufficient information and booking facilities available.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really do want to promote sustainable tourism the length and breadth of Europe, we should give far greater prominence to these ecological considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the development of European tourism is inextricably linked to the development of transport and infrastructure across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of my colleagues have mentioned, tourism is a very important industry. Affordable travel has enabled us to move around more freely for business and pleasure. Air travel in particular has become cheaper and more convenient for everyone. However, small regional airports are finding it more difficult to compete with larger international airports and as a result there has been an imbalance in the regional development of tourism. This needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">This imbalance is very clear in my own country, Ireland, and I would like to dwell on that for a minute, if I may. As an island, we are very dependent on air travel for both tourism and business and, as one of the most open economies in Europe, we have, over the past decade, reaped the benefits of liberalisation of EU regulations regarding air services. The low-cost model of air travel has been a huge success. More and more flights and lower air fares have improved Ireland's attractiveness as a holiday destination and Irish tourism is performing very well.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005 we saw a 4% growth rate in overseas visitor numbers. However, this increase in visitor numbers is masking an underlying trend, a striking regional imbalance. Figures show that visitor growth is concentrated mainly on the east coast of Ireland around the capital, Dublin. The north-west, the west and the Shannon regions are displaying the weakest growth. These regions have very major tourist potential, but they suffer because of lack of comparable access.</p>
<p class="contents">The west, and north-west in particular, have long been at a distinct disadvantage, due to the limited number of flights and destinations available from the regional airports. Aer Lingus, the national carrier, does not serve any European destination except the UK from regional airports. Not only does this cause problems for commuters and tourists in reaching the west and north-west, it also makes it very difficult to access those regions. I would like any policy on tourism to try and address this question, because balanced regional development has been a priority in EU policy and I have always believed that this should also be linked to tourism policy. In that regard, I welcome the recent decision by Commissioner Barrot to introduce new guidelines laying down conditions under which start-up aid can be granted to airlines in regional airports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competitors have bargains to offer, traditional holiday periods and habits are changing, and, not least, new trends are becoming evident. It follows that our own countries, far from being able to rest upon the laurels they won in the past, must go down roads that are new and innovative for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism is still, in many places, highly dependent on the general climate and day-to-day weather conditions. Although many sectors will therefore have suffered from the present continual rain, it may well be that the wellness sector, spas, and urban tourism have benefited from the bad weather.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is to remain attractive as a holiday destination, there is a need for both high-quality products such as the wellness sector can generally offer, and also more alternatives for the periods of bad weather that are occurring more frequently. Developing such new schemes as conservation holidays in areas of outstanding natural beauty, all-in deals for cyclists or cultural tourists would certainly be worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters overall, though, where tourism is concerned, is that it should make good use of Europe’s natural landscapes and their cultural identity while at the same time protecting them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I shall not dwell on the importance of this sector for ports, maritime regions and islands in Europe, I think that the importance of this sector for tourism, employment and for the generation of economic activity is clear enough. However it seems that this sector is not being recognised enough in the laws that we are enacting. Indeed, instead of giving it due incentives sometimes we are almost encouraging it to leave Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain – for example in the sector of taxation such as VAT and Excise, the rules which we have, are difficult to apply to the cruise liners industry and are creating serious difficulties. I am referring both to the existing regulations as well as for the Commission’s new proposals regarding changes in the VAT regime. For example, if you are on a cruise and you are served from the ship restaurant, you pay VAT according to the country from where you left – this means that passengers pay different VAT rates on a cruise, according to the country from which they boarded the ship, and the company which manages the ship has to administer different tax rates according to where the passengers have boarded the ship. This is just one example, however, it is ironic that there is actually an incentive to avoid these problems. If the ship makes use of a port of a country which is not a member of the European Union, then the entire voyage becomes automatically duty free, without taxes and without the administrative burden to collect taxes. Therefore, instead of having incentives making it attractive for the cruise liners industry to stay in European ports, as we should have, we are almost encouraging it to leave Europe. I have no doubt that this is not the policy of the European Union and this was not the intention of the legislator, however we must admit that these anomalies exist and we must remove them. Thus my appeal to Commissioner Verheugen is, to address these anomalies, to give more attention to the cruise liner industry and to entice it to keep investing and growing in the countries of the European Union. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He also deserves to be commended on his enthusiasm for dealing with an issue such as European tourism, which although it is one of the Union’s most dynamic and expanding economic sectors, always seems to be the poor relation of European policies. It is forever crying out for a solid legal basis upon which to strengthen and give a European identity to this sector. Tourism may appear buoyant today, but as it is growing in the shadow of globalisation, it will be eroded as a result of that very same growth and expansion, unless we take care to provide it with a framework establishing conditions of sustainability and guarantees of security, quality and diversity, as well as a high level of professionalism and the necessary stability of professionals and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we therefore need these framework conditions as soon as possible. We need an overall policy that helps to make the wealth and special characteristics of the European historical and tourist heritage more visible. Such a policy must offer an excellent base both for strengthening European identity and cohesion, and for publicising our potential, our European model, outside the Union. To this end, we have proposed creating a ‘European Union’ tourism mark or destination, to be characterised by the enormous diversity, high social quality and sustainability of the tourism it offers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we believe that it is important to support the growing medical and thermal tourism sector. It has significant needs and benefits, but requires sufficient provision and a suitable framework. We also think measures are required to strengthen the personal security of tourists, and protect both European tourists outside of the Union from risks such as prison or kidnapping, and tourists facing risks within the Union. This could be achieved by means of obligatory assistance insurance, which is called for. In addition, we are in favour of measures to promote itinerant tourism with caravans and camper vans, as a good example of more sustainable and less over-crowded tourism; and we are in favour of implementing actions to provide access for people with reduced mobility to tourist establishments and services. Facilities of this nature should be publicised sufficiently, because they often are not.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like once again to urge the European Commission, and Commissioner Verheugen in particular, to explore and study existing and new formulae for dealing with the local and regional imbalances resulting from seasonal concentration in the countries of the south, such as mine. In that case, approaches or measures such as the moratorium or even ecotaxes, which are normal in the north of Europe, in your own country, on the beaches of the Baltic, could also be applied in the south. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in the European Union. In Ireland alone, tourism revenue in 2004 amounted to EUR 5 billion and it accounted for 3.9 % of GNP. From my own perspective, I am particularly interested in the promotion of sustainable tourism, for a number of reasons. First of all, tourism is an indigenous industry – it does not rely on inward investment – and it is not a mobile industry in the sense that there is no off-shoring or outsourcing of jobs. Furthermore, it is a labour-intensive industry and, as such, provides employment for a wide range of people. Therefore, it is fully deserving of support from the Commission and a budget line should be set up to promote the tourism sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism has the capacity to provide employment and generate economic activity in its own region and for its own region. This is of particular importance in rural areas, where numbers are declining in the traditional activities of agriculture and fishing. I welcome the comments of the rapporteur emphasising the need to develop farm holidays.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to rural tourism, there is a need to link projects together for the purposes of marketing and promotion in order to create a critical mass, and it is essential to decentralise tourism functions to the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of access by air, road and rail to the more rural areas is also vital, as the trend is for shorter holidays. That means that tourists will not spend two days of a four- or five-day break travelling to and from their destination. This is of particular importance in my region in the north west of Ireland. The short tourist season is a real concern, with the need to spread the demand outside the high season and promote tourism products for different tastes, different interests, different seasons and different age groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the proposal to introduce a Community-wide classification of hotel facilities and the promotion at EU level of voluntary standards concerning measures to improve safety aspects in hotels and tourist services in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, having met a group of disabled people from Ireland yesterday and today on their Freedom Drive in Strasbourg, I was pleased to note that the rapporteur has invited the Commission to put forward an initiative to make tourism and leisure establishments accessible to people with reduced mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Iron Curtain divided Europe for decades, and the trail will remind future generations of how this continent was divided and of how that division was brought to an end. The project already involves twelve EU Member States. The German Parliament has already voted unanimously in favour of preserving the border that ran along 1 400 km through Germany and of opening it up to environmentally-friendly tourism. This stretch of green runs from the Arctic in the north to the Black Sea in the south, numbers Mikhail Gorbachev among its patrons, and is a suitable means of promoting a European sense of identity. I rejoice at the widespread support for it in this House and hope that the Member States will now waste no time in joining with the Commission to complete it.

<p class="contents">Tourism should develop on a sustainable basis. It should contribute to balanced regional planning without damaging the environment, promote and derive greater benefit from cultural diversity and historical heritage, and encourage regional and local authorities, stakeholders and populations to become involved.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to meet the pressing need to combat the growing problem of precarious work and exploitation affecting workers in the sector, work must be appreciated, decent wages must be paid, the security and stability of working arrangements must be guaranteed and vocational training must be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">We object to certain aspects of the report before us, and feel that other areas have not been given due prominence. We therefore tabled amendments aimed at reaffirming tourism’s role in economic and social cohesion, its connection with the reality on the ground, the need to guarantee high-quality jobs and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the absence of a specific legal basis in the Treaties has not stopped specific measures and programmes geared towards promoting tourism at Community level in the past. Hence our proposal to create a Community programme for the sector, to complement the measures put in place by the Member States.</p>

The proposal aptly illustrates the multi-faceted nature of tourism and the need to coordinate it at European level. The development of this sector of the economy stimulates not only the catering, hotel and transport services, but in the long run also innovation, culture, art and agriculture. This knock-on effect will undoubtedly boost the stagnating economic growth, speed up the progression of national economies towards becoming service economies, and reduce high levels of unemployment that afflict many European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of special types of tourism such as rural, spa or congress tourism would make it possible to overcome certain negative aspects of the industry, especially its seasonal nature. Well-known tourist destinations are often situated on the borderline between two or three Member States, and supporting tourism at the European level would thus also encourage the development of border regions that are often marginalized.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the view that it is not necessary to develop a new financial facility to this end, but simply to coordinate the existing ones. An additional task for the EU would be to improve the publicity for the areas that are visited less frequently. Besides the economic and social aspects, the cultural aspect is not negligible, either.</p>
<p class="contents">Getting to know Europe’s cultural heritage will increase the awareness of history and help build a common European identity. It clearly follows from this report that tourism has a huge potential. For this reason, Europe should respond as quickly as possible and utilise this potential for its own benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is heartening that this excellent report shows the European Union concerning itself with the issue of tourism and stressing its enormous importance in terms of growth and employment. Europe is the most important tourist destination in the world. The tourist sector in Europe can take the credit for creating over 7 million jobs and is among the sectors offering the greatest potential for the creation of new jobs in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The tourist industry is one sector of the economy in which services are generally rendered directly by workers themselves, and this makes it less entrepreneurial in character. It is for precisely this reason that it is necessary to focus more on the promotion of training for workers in this sector, while also paying attention to the conditions under which services are provided. It is now the case that there are regions in Europe where workers are recruited from far away because local people no longer feel themselves able to provide these services under the conditions offered to them. Here, too, there is a task for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Leichtfried himself has repeatedly said, it is encouraging that the issue of coordination in matters of holiday arrangements and of European monitoring of it has been taken up in this report. National and regional holidays need to be properly coordinated by the European Union. We know what that would mean in terms of the strain placed on our infrastructure and in terms of the services that could be offered. The rapporteur did very well to incorporate this idea, which merits our wholehearted support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The structure of the Queiró report is excellent – I therefore congratulate the rapporteur – and I agree with the need to stand up to international competition by concentrating on efficient, quality services and better promotion of Europe’s tourist destinations.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally believe it is essential to strengthen our commitment in the area of training tourism professionals, in order to offer genuine career prospects to operators in the sector, reduce the adverse effects of the instability of the seasonal workforce and guarantee services in tune with the new demands of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, I have tabled some amendments, which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has accepted, in which I propose the creation of a tailor-made training network for tourism skills within Community programmes that are already in operation, such as Erasmus, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I suggest we take further measures, seeking to gradually harmonise tax rates on tourism operators’ profit margins; I also believe that targeted training for operators who receive and take care of elderly tourists and tourists with disabilities is necessary and should be mandatory, so as to guarantee equal rights for those user groups, who are increasingly inclined to take holidays.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I consider it indispensable to standardise the assessment criteria to be used in classifying hotel facilities and in harmonising professional profiles in tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that today Parliament is marking an important turning point, in that the approach and the attention devoted to the major topic that is tourism will no longer be episodic, but constant and commensurate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have all worked very hard to produce this excellent piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">I rise briefly to offer you some Scottish experience, particularly in relation to paragraph 36 on the need for eco-labelling in sustainable tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">In Scotland we have been operating such a scheme for some years now. The Green Tourism Business Scheme is operated on behalf of Visit Scotland by a commercial – though not-for-profit – company. It promotes sustainability, provides practical advice to businesses and provides a level playing field, a certification to ensure consistent quality among its 500 member businesses, all of which are good-quality tourist attractions. I believe it is a model that would work very well when rolled out to other countries across Europe. I believe it has much to commend it.</p>
<p class="contents">A tourist industry focused on sustainability will focus automatically on quality, which is ultimately what the consumer in this modern age demands. In Scotland we have had some success in this, although we also have some lessons to learn from it.

Tourism is a fundamental activity for my country, Italy, and especially so for my city, Rome. That is why his report is of particular interest to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism is an essential resource for creating strong growth in employment at a time of serious economic downturn. Europe has a natural vocation to be a tourist destination, not only because we are the richest continent in history, art and culture, but also because of our approach to tourism, which favours quality and respect for the environment and countryside: travel as a form of cultural enrichment.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of brevity, I should like to mention two reasons why I consider that tourism can no longer be thought of as a policy that falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States, and that a European policy needs to be developed instead. First, tourism needs to be promoted within Europe as a form of exchange and a way of getting to know each other; secondly, economic stagnation and international challenges force us to think of tourism in global terms. We have to attract the new demand from China, Brazil and India, by proposing an integrated product and promoting the whole of Europe as a destination.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford to waste this opportunity, in a sector in which we have the greatest potential for growth, development and employment. This report offers a number of ideas around which intelligent proposals can be drawn up: tourist destinations of excellence, cutting VAT rates for operators, and promoting agrotourism, a very Italian form of rural tourism to encourage farmers not to leave the countryside and to promote traditional produce.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of recent tragic accidents, I should like to finish by pointing out that Europe needs to guarantee the safety of its tourists. In that respect, Parliament must adopt the blacklist regulation as soon as possible, as well as all the measures needed to be able to act swiftly to manage crises, as in the case of the attacks in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims set out in the report are ambitious and innovative. Therefore, Commissioner, we call for careful attention and adequate financial support for an industry that is of vital importance for the whole of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is the world's favourite tourist destination, but with the emergence of new competitors, as has already been mentioned, we can maintain this situation only by creating better tourist facilities, higher quality services and information, and a high level of consumer protection and safety. This requires cooperation between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a new Member State, I emphasise that all of us benefit from enlargement in the field of tourism, so future enlargements would give a further boost to the sector's economic weight and its importance to European growth. As Vice-Chairwoman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I am sure that the growth of tourism will lead to more opportunities, prospects and appropriate working conditions for female employees, who represent the majority of the sector's workers, as well as businesswomen in tourism and, most importantly, to more jobs for women.</p>
<p class="contents">In developing tourism, we must not forget the socially vulnerable groups and people with disabilities, representing more than 10 million Europeans. I welcome the initiative to make tourist and leisure establishments, facilities, services and itineraries accessible to people with reduced mobility and disability.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress that this is a great challenge for the new Member States, which will have to overcome huge disadvantages in this sector. Tourism still does not receive the attention it should in the EU. There is no tourism website on the EU portal and Eurostat publishes only a few tourism statistics. I therefore recommend that we have a 'European Year of Tourism', which would be accompanied by a wide range of events and programmes to highlight the social and economic importance of tourism. Experience of Member States' practices in this area is important and increased cooperation between Member States on best practice could be useful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall begin by saying that all my fears have been allayed by my colleague Mr Queiró’s report, and I shall therefore restrict myself to reiterating certain ideas, emphasising others and adding some new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The report starts by stressing the importance of tourism from the cultural and economic points of view. From a cultural perspective, and given that we have referred to our own personal experiences, I believe that the transition from dictatorship to democracy in my country was possible because we wanted to be like the other Europeans, and we knew what Europeans were like because of the phenomenon of tourism. In addition, thanks to the phenomenon of tourism, Spain was able to begin to leave behind poverty and take off towards a new economic horizon. This would have justified more emphatic treatment in the Treaties, something that did not happen. Since then, however, new developments have taken place, such as the increase in travel, in new technologies, in life expectancy and in incomes, all of which favour tourism amongst senior citizens. I would also like to say at this point that I entirely support the proposal Mr Yáñez will make in this field. I know he has not spoken yet, but he has been kind enough to tell me about it in advance — pure intelligence is what is required.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be recognised that the increase in tourism has caused certain problems in terms of sustainability, ecological balance, physical security, food safety, legal security in the field of delays, non-compliance with contracts, time-sharing and competitiveness. All of these have been emphasised here. At this point I would like once again to stress the importance of the issue of value added tax in the special system for travel agencies and the reduced rate, to which Mrs Sudre has referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to raise something new which is not in the report, namely compensation from the states of origin to the host states for health services provided by the latter. I believe this to be an extremely important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by congratulating my colleague from the bottom of my heart on his wonderful work. I take my hat off to you, Mr Queiró. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sustainable European tourism can and must help to maintain high and stable levels of economic growth, especially in tourist regions, where it is the basic pillar of economic and social viability. The tourist industry, which mainly attracts women and young people, substantially strengthens the employment sector and is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these are highly critical times for the development of tourism on a global scale and this also directly affects our employment policies and competition in the industry, in which thousands of small and medium-sized businesses trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that tourism policy falls within the competence of the Member States, the importance of this industry at European level is such that provision needs to be made for a financial heading in the Community budget. At the same time, better coordination is needed between the Member States so that we are ready and able to effectively meet the new challenges thrown up by changes in tourist trends and by economic and social changes at European and international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic precondition when designing any tourism policy is an in-depth knowledge of peculiarities and problems at local level. In order to achieve this, we need to use scientific tools and methods, invest in research and development and create a European network of regional tourism monitoring centres to coordinate and transfer technical know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">The response by European tourism to the current competitive challenge must include as a matter of priority competitive tourist businesses which will provide quality services, will not have an impact on the environment and will not change the local culture. European tourism must respond in a responsible manner, placing the emphasis on the Union's economic and cultural values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My second point is one that emerges quite clearly from the Queiró report, namely that we must not sideline, or even disregard entirely, such an important aspect of social, cultural and economic life.</p>
<p class="contents">Many arguments have been put forward during today’s debate in favour of this approach, and I should like to add one more, which in my opinion is of no little significance. Tourism is also a form of interpersonal communication, since tourists not only visit monuments and tourist attractions, but also, and above all, meet new people they had not previously known. Any earlier prejudices, negative stereotypes or memories of unfortunate historic events fade away and disappear during the course of such meetings, and in fact personal contact with other people is the only way to change such attitudes. People who communicate with one another stop being strangers, which is a crucial lesson for the enlarged European Union, and in particular for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore propose that the Socrates and Erasmus programmes be taken as models for the development of tourism schemes for young people. We should provide them with the opportunity to get to know the whole of Europe, from Spain to Estonia and from Sweden to Malta and Cyprus. This would promote a much greater degree of mutual understanding than has been the case to date. I believe that serious work should be put into schemes of this kind, and that neither time nor money should be spared on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I come from Portugal, and from a region, the Autonomous Region of Madeira, in which tourism is one of the main tools for development, it stands to reason that I have a vested interest in supporting this report. I shall now mention some of the reasons behind my support and my proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of its importance at European, national and regional level, of the jobs that it sustains and of the number of businesses, the new technology and the innovation that it fosters, tourism can be considered as one of the areas in which the Lisbon Strategy can be taken forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism is also a means of diversifying the economy and of developing rural areas and regions with natural or demographic disadvantages, such as the outermost regions, remote or mountainous regions, and the most northerly, sparsely populated regions. The EU is the most popular tourist destination in the world and yet EU citizens visit tourist destinations outside the Union in the greatest numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">Although tourism remains under the competence of the Member States and their regional and local authorities, it should, however, be subject to EU guidelines, policies and measures. The Union should support, coordinate and complement the Member States. There should be greater integration and cohesion amongst the actions of Member States and the Union in relation to tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for it to assume its responsibilities as regards tourism, I would suggest that the Commission confer on the Union more effective structures and adequate financial resources in the financial perspective, in order to promote Europe as a destination, and to set up mechanisms designed to foster greater cooperation and exchange of information between the Union’s structures, the Member States and the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism should remain within European-level parameters whereby environmental protection, regional planning, the training of the work force and cultural traditions are guaranteed if all those responsible carry out their functions. In the area of the security and the rights of tourists, we feel that take particular account should be taken of ...</p>

I am from southern Baden, in the centre of which is the Black Forest and where many important jobs do indeed depend on foreign tourists; this is particularly the case in rural areas, which are doing a successful job of moving from agriculture to the service economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, though, that there are many areas in which we do not necessarily need European rules and regulations, and, unlike many Members, I certainly do not propose to urge you, Commissioner Verheugen, to plan further regulations in this one. What tourists in Europe need most of all are railways and roads that work. I do not doubt that they also need airlines, even though some other Members of this House seem less than pleased with that idea.</p>
<p class="contents">If we attempt to tackle the synchronisation of holiday arrangements, then we must make the attempt – which we did not do in relation to the sunshine directive, that was made slightly weaker this morning – to make it clear, in the long term and very politely, to the Member States that the directive was conceived in consultation with the interested parties and is not to be seen as something forced upon them by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that I believe will be of vital importance to Europe is the question of how the safety of facilities for tourists in Europe may be guaranteed. We have all heard from people who have had adverse experiences in them, and nine of the ten victims of the fatal accident in Sölden in the Tyrol came from my electoral district. It seems likely that tourism in Europe will suffer more as a result of accidents like that happening more frequently than from this or that part of the directive not being transposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence my appeal to you, Commissioner, in the hope that we may be able to take such action in relation to safety as the European Union is able to take, and, moreover, may encourage diversity in European tourism, for therein lies its strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This programme has existed in Spain for 20 years. I am referring to the IMSERSO holidays. Find out about them via your services, because they have been a spectacular success’.</p>
<p class="contents">A programme of this kind has five fundamental objectives. The first is to improve the quality of life of our senior citizens on low incomes. Many of them have not had the opportunity to travel, to see the sea and to visit other countries. Secondly, such a programme must create employment for example in hotels, restaurants, transport facilities that have to shut or drastically reduce their staff in low seasons. The third objective is to generate demand and growth in the European economy by means of greater activity and consumption. The fourth involves promoting European citizenship, as in the case of the SOCRATES or ERASMUS programmes amongst young people. The fifth objective has to do with all this not being an expense but rather an investment, because the Spanish experience demonstrates that the returns exceed the sum budgeted annually by the government by 1.8%. That is only via taxes and social security returns and does not include indirect and inferred returns.</p>
<p class="contents">We named the programme ‘Ulysses’ after the great traveller from Ithaca, but if you like, Commissioner, if it would please you, we will call it the ‘Günter’ Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I think this is a very important area. I come from Finland, so I do not want to make this into a commercial for a mobile phone company, but it is the best way of connecting people. Karl Deutsch talked about it in the 1930s. It is a way of crossing borders: if you go to the Algarve, you fall in love with Portugal; if you go to the Marche, you fall in love with Italy; if you go to the Costa del Sol, you might fall in love with Spain, and if you go to Provence, you fall in love with France. It is as simple as that.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, we get growth, GDP; 4% of GDP stems from our tourist industry, with six million people employed and two million SMEs in the sector, so it is a very important and, in many ways, a key area.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is also an area of growth. There is real growth potential in the services sector. In that sense, it is an important part of the Lisbon process. We have an ageing population, a population with more money and more time, a population with more time to travel. All of that is good.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I support the report that has been produced by my colleague. It is an excellent report. One thing I find unfortunate, but the rapporteur could not do anything about it, is that we did not get tourism into the treaty, because the Constitution has not yet entered into force, but I think the system of classification in the report is good.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that Mr Berlusconi and Mr Chirac read this report and become inspired to travel around Europe and taste different kinds of food. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This implies additional budget revenue generation and possibilities to explore and get to know the lesser-known States on the tourist maps, but on the other hand, it poses new challenges. In our countries we are lucky to have the opportunity to draw upon the experience of the older EU Member States and thus avoid repeating their mistakes. The growing tourist influx into Central Europe is expected to alleviate the pressure upon the EU regions currently suffocating from the over-abundant flow of tourists. The tourism infrastructure in the new Member States is still lagging behind that of the old ones, which therefore offers tempting new investment opportunities. There are abundant untouched natural resources in the Central European States, including Lithuania. Sustainable tourism is meant to preserve and protect nature, as well as the landscape, urban and rural infrastructure. Specifically promising areas in Lithuania appear to be rural, cultural, sport and medicinal tourism. Due to their low prices, these countries are attractive to young people, although the elderly also willingly come to Lithuania because of the healthy local climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourists show interest in history, but the tragic, historically significant and even complicated events of recent decades should not be trivialized or presented in a Disneyland or kitsch style. The revision of the Sixth Tax directive with a view to introducing tax relief for incoming tourism is essential for all Member States of the European Union, and the new members in particular. By reforming the tourism industry, the EU is promoting economic growth and mutual understanding. This will also make a significant contribution toward the elimination of demarcation lines that have continued to divide Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past, voyagers were people who went out into the world in order to discover more about it, to learn something and to return home with new experiences and skills. During their travels across Europe, they also paid visits to the universities. This led to the emergence of a European identity, an awareness of European values and a Europe of universities, cathedrals and superb artists and craftsmen.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism nowadays has changed into the pursuit of instant pleasure. I still have frequent occasion to quote the slogan of the French Ski Schools, which says that ‘pleasure has to be learnt’. It is only when we make an effort to gain new skills or knowledge that we appreciate them. Unfortunately, modern tourism is very much like visiting a Europe-wide chain of supermarkets that all subscribe to the same principles, namely to be cheap, easily accessible and preferably identical in the majority of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">People now travel at lightning speed. We have less and less time, and so we devour one tourist attraction after another. The tourist industry is adapting to this phenomenon by selling as many colour pictures as possible of the sea, the mountains and the swimming pools. The phrase ‘tourism creates jobs’ is repeated like a mantra, but the cost of such jobs is frequently the mindless breaking of visitor number records. The resort or attraction boasting the highest number of visitors is considered to be the best.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is important because Europe must promote high-quality tourism and tackle the challenge of mass tourism. This is especially true because Europe is now lending its backing to the development of regional airports and cheap airlines. The words ‘travel’ and ‘voyage’ should regain their original meanings. Educational programmes must be put in place with a view to protecting the natural environment and historical heritage, and new initiatives are needed to promote sustainable tourism. We should not forget that love of world heritage, nature and the non-material stems from knowledge of the values of the world that surround us, or in other words from our own ‘small fatherlands’.</p>

It is being held towards the end of the summer tourist season, of which we all have our personal experiences, and it is being held for the first time after the recent accession of ten new Member States to the European Union, which they enhance with their exceptional tourist destinations.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, with Mr Queiró's report, this is the first time that the multifaceted nature of economic activity in tourism has been presented, together with its repercussions throughout the spectrum of the economy, society, natural and cultural resources and mutual acquaintance between nations. It is highly satisfactory that the European Commission – as the Commissioner said – is targeting the leading role which European tourism can play in the future. However, particular attention and a serious strategy are needed for this, because we must not forget that the increase in tourism in the European Union in the first half of 2005 was just 5%, compared with 17% in the Middle East as a whole and around 10% in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to emphasise in particular the added value which the European Union can bring to the policies of the Member States. Apart from the development of secure transport at national and trans-European level, other proposals contained in the report are also extremely important. I refer to cooperation and coordination on the conditions of entry of third-country nationals, cooperation on the flow of tourists in the high season, in order to overcome the imbalance between areas which are literally drowning and others which are seeking to attract tourists, on the promotion of tourist programmes such as the 'Ulysses' programme, on educational exchanges and mobility, so that we have certification of professional qualifications and, also, on the structured projection of Europe as a tourist destination with diversity and, of course, on the budget line for tourism in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, indeed, a very welcome development that an opinion on sustainable tourism should be worked out at European level. In the knowledge that most measures must be taken by the Member States, we have to establish that there are problems that Europe should take to heart. Tourism is, after all, a very important sector for the European public and also for our European economy. This is an ambitious report and that is why I am interested to know whether the Commissioner would like to say something about it and with which proposals and measures the Commission would actually like to tackle the job.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not only a task for the Commission but also for the Council, for the report appeals to the Council to speed up the decision-making process on the reduced VAT rate. I have made out a case for this, because the reduced VAT rate is crucial for the tourism industry. Very many jobs hinge on it and the VAT rate should remain low for hotels in all Member States on a permanent basis. They should also be able to apply in a structured way reduced VAT rates for restaurants.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the Council is not present, because I was actually very interested to see whether it expects to reach agreement on this by the end of this year. It may be possible for the Commissioner to comment on the report, and perhaps we as Parliament and Commission should bring more pressure to bear on the Council to finally force it into taking a decision, for these proposals are very important for employment, particularly in this economic climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the request for quality indicators for the tourism industry, provided, though, that we fully utilise that industry’s expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say that this excellent report by Mr Queiró illustrates why our committee is not called ‘Committee on Transport and Tourism’ for nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not abandoned hope that there will be real action about this strategy rather than just even more talk.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I would particularly press the Commission to look at is something that is a matter of fundamental concern to my own country. As is well known, Austria is a holiday destination both in summer and in winter, and year by year, season by season, we have the same experience of a few weeks when the hotels and guesthouses are full up and there is gridlock on the streets. A lot of things would be easier to handle a couple of weeks later – that is, assuming the tourists were still there.</p>
<p class="contents">If nations and regions – and here I am also thinking of the principal works holidays in your own country, Mr Vice-President, as well as in the Netherlands and in Belgium – were to synchronise their holidays better, it would have an enormous effect on Central Europe and would, in particular, really take the load off the tourist industry and offer it new opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need here is not direction from on high or from Brussels, but we have learned, not least from the debates on the European Constitution, that a lot can be done by means of the coordination method, if it is taken seriously and handled properly. With that in mind, Commissioner, we can do no other than wish you much success and hope that European holidays will soon be better synchronised, that the tourism sector will grow and that tourists will benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course not only an ecological, but also an economic matter. We must seek to enable enterprises to survive, and taxation is only one aspect of this; it is also important that enterprises be enabled to invest for the future, so as to create a sustainable supply of investment that is also reflected in global competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I welcome the initiative in the Committee on Budgets by Mr Mulder – a specialist in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises – together with the European Investment Fund, aimed in particular at the provision, in future, of equity loans and other guarantees, the intention being to make sure that the risk and investment capital in tourism enterprises is secure in the long term, too, with a view to their sustainability. The fact is that negative equity is one of the main problems facing the tourism sector; a great many enterprises are going bankrupt, with the loss of large numbers of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on Basel II is imminent, and that debate, in particular, is a matter of life and death for tourism. After all, liquidity is a matter of life and death for every enterprise. I would therefore urge the Commissioner to keep up his commitment, particularly as regards the relevant programme for small and medium-sized enterprises. He has already done an exemplary job in this regard and, if we keep up the good work, we can succeed in doing what is best for tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For this reason, it has already been agreed that a European Tourism Forum is to be held in Malta in October, where I shall be unveiling the key elements of the Commission’s future tourism policy. In addition, as I have already told your Committee, there are plans to present, early next year, a fundamental review of EU tourism policy to date in the form of a new strategy. I shall gladly incorporate into this all the ideas – and there have been very, very many of them – that I have been able to draw from today’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to make one very clear qualification, which is that I am unable to raise the hopes of those speakers who, this afternoon, have called for protectionism, interventionism or subsidies. The Commission’s ideas will be far removed from any form of State intervention, State protection or, particularly, of subsidy. We shall most definitely not be launching a new subsidised sector, but instead shall create framework conditions using all the instruments we have for supporting the framework conditions for an economic sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to state equally clearly that I shall never accept the assertion that it is the Commission’s job to set up a ‘tourism and the elderly’ programme. If the tourism industry believes it should be doing something special for the elderly, then it should be so good as to do that itself; the Commission, at any rate, will not. We can propose it, but we shall not take upon ourselves those things that the tourism industry should be doing. Instead, we shall ensure that the tourism industry enjoys conditions conducive to development. It is for people themselves to run their own businesses; that is a function we shall most certainly not be taking from them.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we shall come to agree on this principle, and also, most certainly, on the principle that we do not wish to take the retrograde step of calling for more and more European rules, standards and regulations. I really was rather astonished this afternoon to hear the call for large numbers of new European rules, and my answer to this is an unambiguous ‘no’. For the Commission’s part, at least, there will be no European standards for hotels, inns or coaches. The last thing the Commission needs is to have to take on thousands of testers and send them to Europe’s restaurants to determine whether certain minimum standards of quality stipulated by the Commission ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, you did say that, and my reply is a clear ‘no’. Let the tourism industry agree on its own quality requirements. Where safety is concerned, however, it is a different matter; the appropriate arrangements are in place for this, but arranging and imposing quality standards in certain economic sectors is a matter for the sector itself rather than for the public legislator. I would also ask that Parliament finally show some consistency on this, and not criticise the Commission for excessive interference in economic matters, whilst at the same time repeatedly demanding that we take the industry’s tasks upon ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This difference of opinion notwithstanding, though, I think that this debate has revealed a good deal of common ground, and I am quite sure that we shall succeed in arriving at a forward-looking common policy on tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Good health is essential for physical and mental well-being. So equal access to health care services should be obligatory in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">There are serious challenges to be highlighted:</p>
<p class="contents">Women have specific health characteristics, their health status is also determined by socio-economic factors, like lower living standards, higher unemployment, lower wages.</p>
<p class="contents">Many health problems affect women only or differently.</p>
<p class="contents">Lately, many people have become aware that women and men are treated differently in those services.</p>
<p class="contents">There is few information concerning differences in the effects of medication on women. Even those intended specifically for women, are normally tested on men only.</p>
<p class="contents">Women working in health care outnumber men but are underrepresented in health care decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to highlight the violence and abuse to which women have been subjected by men close to them, and through trafficking and prostitution. It causes serious physical and psychological public health problems and effects also children's healthy development.</p>
<p class="contents">Mammography screening programs (to prevent breast cancer) exist in only nine Member States!</p>

<p class="contents">I shall confine myself to some brief thoughts. For years now we have all been aware of the important part played by tourism in developing local economies and creating jobs, especially for women and young people. The European Conference on Tourism and Employment, organised by the Luxembourg Presidency in November 1997, showed ‘the pulling power that tourism exercises on young people and women, to whom it often offers a first job opportunity’. For that reason as well, we in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully support the call for the Commission and the Council, when adopting the structural policy instruments for 2007-2013, to provide for an integrated approach to tourism, ‘allowing the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Regional Development Fund actions to be coordinated’.</p>
<p class="contents">A further aspect that I must underline, which is something totally new, is the reference to itinerant tourism, represented particularly by camper vans and caravans. This is effectively a segment of the tourist industry that is active 365 days a year and contributes to employment growth in the sector. In lean times, that is no bad thing! This segment therefore needs measures to encourage its development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
