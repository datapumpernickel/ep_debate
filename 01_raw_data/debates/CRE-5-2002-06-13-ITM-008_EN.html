Dozens of opponents of the regime of President Teodoro Obiang have been arbitrarily arrested and brought before the courts accused of conspiracy, incitement to rebellion and attempted murder of the president.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the only purpose of the trial, which began on 23 May, is to put the opposition leaders out of the running. Along with their families, the latter are being held in inhuman conditions and are the victims of brutal torture. Freedom of expression and of the press is systematically flouted, and independent journalists are subject to insidious daily pressure. A repressive and brutal policy is being conducted against everyone with an ideology opposed to that of the regime. The 68 opposition leaders have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in the course of an unfair trial, which has made a mockery of people’s most basic rights to a defence. A number have even been in danger of receiving the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that Equatorial Guinea respect its commitments to the international community and the European Union and engage in a genuine process of democratisation including the holding of free elections and complete respect for human rights. A dialogue must be instituted between the opposition forces with a view to guaranteeing political rights, democracy and pluralism. With this in mind, the trial must be annulled and the political prisoners freed immediately. As for the press, it must be free to cover the events and to do so in safety. In order for that to happen, it is essential that the problem of Equatorial Guinea be raised as a matter of urgency within the Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly and that the Council and the Commission be very firm indeed in their relations with the government of this country.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to guarantee the rapid re-establishment of the rule of law and respect for human rights, a consultation procedure between the government of Guinea and the European Union needs to be put in place as quickly as possible, and this in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. As Europeans, we cannot now remain indifferent to what is happening in Equatorial Guinea and to the human rights violations there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is happening in Equatorial Guinea, which since its independence has had two extraordinary presidents and is now experiencing a highly unusual political situation, if we look at the latest United Nations report and the international press, sets a contradictory scene: while the international community is supporting Equatorial Guinea both technically and financially, perhaps because it is interested in its oil wealth, the authorities in the country are not respecting the most basic human rights. This resolution is therefore appropriate in condemning those violations of human rights in this African republic, which for many years was associated with my region, the Canary Islands, the bridge between Africa and Europe. This explains my political interest in supporting and defending the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group wishes to express our agreement with the Council’s position in expressing a grave concern for the political deterioration, procedural anomalies and lack of respect for human rights on the part of the Guinean authorities. The European Union should therefore review its political relations with this African republic and call on President Obiang to establish the rule of law that has been lost and to begin to open up democracy for the good of his country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The totalitarian regime in Malabo has tried to get rid of those who could represent a democratic alternative. It is true that a few years ago the process would have meant that the opponents would have been physically eliminated and it is also true that the fact that the country has joined the ACP Community as a signatory of the Cotonou Agreement has led the regime to act with more respect for the standards of the rule of law, holding a trial and allowing international observers to attend it.</p>
<p class="contents">This revealed a grotesque set-up in terms of its lack of legal legitimacy. There was talk of a plot to overthrow the regime and even to assassinate the Head of State, without putting forward the slightest bit of evidence, with brutally tortured witnesses and defendants, a public prosecution service that raised its initial petition of eight death sentences to eighteen, and a final verdict which, although not so extreme, punished the main people accused with long prison sentences, thus removing them as potential adversaries in any electoral battle.</p>
<p class="contents">We were struck by the contrast between the incompetence of the officials of the dictatorship, judges, public prosecution, police, etc. and the admirable dignity of the defendants and defence lawyers. It is extraordinary that, despite the ill treatment inflicted on them, there was not a single witness or defendant who confirmed in the trial the statements that had been extracted from them in police stations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to express our repulsion at such a corrupt and anachronistic regime and our solidarity and confidence in the democratic future of Equatorial Guinea. In that country there are people of unquestionable bravery and convictions who undoubtedly represent a better future for their people. This future is what the European Union needs to support, without, of course, falling into judgements that betray our own values. For now, there are clauses in the Cotonou Agreement that we should activate in order to make it known in Malabo that practices such as the trial I mentioned are simply incompatible with its association with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since March this year, opponents of President Obiang's regime have been arbitrarily detained and tried under deplorable and unacceptable conditions. Detainees have been subjected to brutal and inhumane torture and often prevented from contacting their families and lawyers. In some cases, detainees' family members have been arrested merely because of their connection to the accused. Independent journalists reporting on political trials have come under extreme pressure, while several human rights organisations report that deaths have occurred from injuries sustained from torture while in detention.</p>
<p class="contents">The nature and timing of the arrests lead me to detect a cynical attempt by the authorities to spread fear in advance of the elections due to be held next year. I believe the Red Cross should be given immediate access to detainees, international monitors should be introduced and arbitrary detention must be brought to an end. Equatorial Guinea is in clear breach of every human rights convention it has signed. It is undermining its own commitment to the Union on democratisation and the full implementation of human rights. This Union must take a firm stand with the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and demand that prior commitments be honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">To speak of justice in that country is to speak the language of torture and of systematic brutality. This betrayal of core human values serves to remind us of the often-tragic gap between words and action and human rights in many parts of the world. This House must meet the challenge of bridging that gap with vigour and authority. We demand that the EU as a whole makes its concerns known to the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and call for an end to the current abuse of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The recent trial, which was a sham, and which was also, according to all of the observers and as confirmed by Amnesty International, riddled with evidence of torture, is an insult to the values that we defend in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to express our solidarity with all those detained, with all the democratic parties that are doing an incredible job under those conditions in order to move forward in solving these problems through democratic values, and I say incredible because desperation is also appearing among the youth of Equatorial Guinea, and the seeds are appearing of what could be a violent response to so much brutality and dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we have to make an extraordinary effort to promote the path of democracy in Equatorial Guinea and not only condemn the dictatorship, but also those Western countries who, either by action or by omission, are in practice supporting the continuance of the dictator. I therefore think that the work of people such as Onbam Ndong and Plácido Mikó should be highlighted, as they are doing important work, the latter as the secretary of the Convergence for Social Democracy party.</p>

<p class="contents">Freeing those convicted and the members of their families and restoring the bar association should be demands from the European Parliament.

<p class="contents">Equatorial Guinea has already committed itself internally with the European Union and with the whole of the international community, as a signatory of the Convention against Torture, to begin the transition to democracy, in other words, to hold free elections in a context of respect for human rights. Failing to comply with that international obligation gives rise to sanctions that we request from the Commission and the EU-ACP Council of Ministers as part of the Cotonou Agreement. In this sense, democratic conditionality, used in a constructive manner, is a key tool in the European Union’s development policy.</p>

Parliamentary and presidential elections served only to prop up his autocratic regime and give it the outward appearance of legitimacy. After he abrogated the democratic constitution in 1996, the OSCE sent a mission of observers to the country with the aim of re-establishing dialogue and helping to restore the foundations of a democratic order. Its task was an unambitious one, but even that was too much for President Lukashenko.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, the Commission and the Council worked closely together with the OSCE mission, and the experience increased our regard for its achievements, as repeated attempts were made, in a situation with few – if any – prospects, to set up dialogue, even if only a tenuous one, to at least work towards the minimum criteria we had established, and to find a way to restore normal relations. Yet even that was too much for Mr Lukashenko, who made it unmistakably clear, in a major speech last month, that he wants no more OSCE missions in the country once the presidential elections are over.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simply not as if we are dealing here with a country that is not a member of the OSCE and has not acknowledged its rules; on the contrary, he himself subscribed to the OSCE rules and democratic standards. This has not stopped him putting the media out of action, meaning that any dissident is at his mercy. I believe that we must protest vigorously about this, and it is clear that normal relations with the European Union will not be possible if dialogue on the basis of the OSCE mission is not begun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that the brutality of the regime in Minsk knows no bounds, and the way in which they are now managing to close down the OSCE office in that city by no longer issuing visas to diplomats who work there, is in itself a disgrace which once again illustrates how poor the quality of democracy in that country is.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a rather personal matter to us because many in this House know the people who are now being ousted out of the country, if they have not been ousted already. Over the course of two elections, we have joined forces with the OSCE team in Minsk in a very pleasant and effective partnership. On two occasions, we, along with the OSCE, have had to conclude that the outcome of the elections was not legitimate, and this is the problem we are essentially faced with. Also, we have always said that the European Union and the OSCE should be pro-active in supporting civil society and the opposition. This is what Mr Lukashenko considers unacceptable and what he tries to avoid at all cost. This is also why we are calling on the European Union too to find out when the office will actually be closing down and whether we should also consider ceasing the TACIS activities because these have probably become ineffective, since they share the same objective as the work of the OSCE. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the closure is not an act of strength on the part of Belarus. The event is, rather, an expression of weakness. Secondly, Belarus is actually signalling, albeit in a desperate way, that it is seeking contact with the EU. Thirdly, Belarus is seeking a bargaining counter, or something to play off against the European Union. Fourthly, Belarus is trying in this way to give prominence to its basic need also to join the European Union in addressing the border issues and the refugee situation within Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this analysis, we can openly enter into talks with Belarus, taking of course as our starting point our vigorous and fundamental criticism of the unacceptable incident at the OSCE office in Minsk.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Liikanen, whom I would call upon to approach Commissioner Patten, to step up all their contacts with Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in Minsk in connection with the OSCE office is a sign that Belarus is ultimately appealing for some form of contact. They are doing so in an unacceptable way. We cannot, however, allow neighbours of an enlarged European Union to behave as they have in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the European Union to state clearly that, within the framework of the union between Belarus and Russia, President Putin of Russia has a major and special responsibility for putting pressure on Belarus to act in an internationally credible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present joint draft resolution is right to express its deep respect for this mission. What is exactly the merit of the Advisory and Monitoring Group? Its former head of mission and great driving force, Mr Hans-Georg Wieck, has given a thumbnail description of this commitment: observation of the human rights situation and administration of justice in Belarus, legal assistance for the affected families, reporting of processes and interventions in cases of violations of the law, humanitarian aid to victims of state persecution on political grounds and by administrative and criminal penalties, development of the range of action and cooperation of political parties, the forming of a coalition of parties and social forces, observation of elections, also involving the local population, and finally, projects reinforcing civil society. Needless to say, all these activities have been a thorn in the side of the authoritarian President of Belarus, Mr Alexander Lukashenko, from the very outset. He has therefore done everything in his power to ignore or undermine the work of the OSCE mission, or what is worse, gave it a bad name in public. This has certainly not done anything for the popularity ratings of the recognised ballot director Lukashenko. Quite the reverse, in fact. While in the opinion polls, his popularity is consistently declining, that of the OSCE mission so detested by him is on the increase. It is therefore hardly surprising that the Belarussian Head of State is now trying to force the OSCE mission in Minsk to resign by refusing the necessary visa to be issued. It is up to the Council and the Commission to stop him, in close cooperation, if at all possible, with the Russian Federation, since we cannot afford to abandon civil society in Belarus, which is finally regaining political and social consciousness, at this crucial time. I therefore agree with Hans-Georg Wieck that nothing less than the credibility of the European institutions is in the balance here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The visits that we have made with Mr Wiersma, Mr Sacrédeus, Mrs Schröder and other Members to gauge the situation have shown that in Belarus society there is a vast majority and wide range of social, political, cultural and professional forces in favour of democracy and the values of Western Europe, with strong desires to move their position towards the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">As has already been said, what happened with the OSCE mission is unacceptable.

Byelorussia, or Belarus, will, in a very short time, be one of the European Union's neighbours. What was termed Poland in the Middle Ages was in actual fact a federation consisting of Poland, Lithuania and Byelorussia, each part having equal rights. Lithuania and Poland will, next year or the year thereafter, be able to become members of the European Union, whereas Belarus seems today to be further away than the Democratic Republic of Congo, about which we were speaking earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a tragedy, responsibility for which lies principally at Mr Lukashenko's door. The people of Belarus played a part in the democracy movement that led to the fall of Communism and helped to bring about the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It is for that reason that we have to give forthright support to the movement for democracy and human rights in that country, a movement that is supported not only by us but by former human rights campaigners in Prague, Warsaw and elsewhere; we have to send a signal to the people there that we know that they are Europeans, and that they really belong to us. We must, of course, use all democratic and diplomatic means to work towards the OSCE becoming genuinely operational there, to ensure the failure of the attempts at doing away with monitoring and concealing this oppression behind a veil of authoritarian measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, be very wary of involving Moscow in this process, as Moscow, being the former colonial power, of course bears some responsibility for what is happening in Belarus today. We have to work together with everyone, including Russia, but I see the European Union as having a special responsibility to make it clear that this European people too will have a place among us, but that the OSCE, and then the Council of Europe, must do their work, and, above all and most crucially, human rights must be made to prevail. That all this should be, as it were, obscured and befogged by one regime, is something we cannot permit.</p>

<p class="contents">The EU and its Member States have supported all OSCE moves to keep the OSCE assistance mission in Belarus open and running. The EU has issued a number of statements, either in the OSCE in Vienna or from the Presidency in Madrid, strongly condemning the action by the Belarus authorities to suppress the activities of the OSCE office in Minsk. Via its delegation in Vienna or during the Council working group meetings, the Commission has been very active in the discussions on the OSCE position vis-à-vis Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The closure of the OSCE mission in Minsk would put in jeopardy many of the mission's activities, notably the observance of Belarus' commitments under OSCE human rights rules. If the mission is closed, this reporting will no longer be possible. The case of Mr Andrew Carpenter is just one illustration of the methods used by the Belarus authorities to gag OSCE observers working in their country in full compliance with OSCE and diplomatic rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made it clear, in its contacts with the Belarus authorities, that it regards the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group as a significant test case for the authorities' approach to the development of democracy, civil society and human rights in Belarus. If Belarus intends to join the democratic family of European nations and to establish fully-fledged relations with the EU at all levels, it should demonstrate this by accepting the mandate and the services of the AMG.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall follow developments very closely and if need be propose further action to support the OSCE resolve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the arrest of Mr Riad al-Turk, a 72 year-old lawyer and secretary-general of the banned Communist Party, there are suggestions that Syria might be about to enter a new phase of repression, following a gradual thawing of relations with the West and a desirable but limited opening-up of the Syrian economy to market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Although no expert, I would certainly support the calls for all prisoners of conscience to be freed, in Syria and elsewhere. It is vital that the Syrian Government understands the need to distinguish between those who advocate violence or rebellion and those who simply advocate political change. I also fully support the paragraphs in the motion calling for the Syrian authorities to ensure that detainees are not tortured in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights cannot be detached from wider political developments in the region. Only yesterday I was privileged to hear the very fine speech by the King of neighbouring Jordan, an exemplary role model of moderation and wisdom.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years Syria sponsored terrorism in both Israel and Turkey and was the main state to reject any compromise solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute based on land for peace. There are signs that the end of the Cold War and the new geopolitical realities of the region have forced the adoption of a more reasonable and even pragmatic foreign policy by Damascus. Syrian leaders need to recognise the importance of the recent shift in international opinion and, in particular, the widespread support for a viable democratic Palestinian state and to work with – not against – the international community for a comprehensive regional settlement, including the return of the Golan Heights. Only then, I believe, will Syria be able to fully develop its potential as a nation and to offer its people the peace and prosperity which they truly deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After spending 18 years in prison for crimes of opinion, the lawyer, Riad al-Turk, was released in 1998. In recent months, he has been imprisoned anew, also for crimes of opinion. The trial is in progress and the defendant is in danger of being sentenced to 15 years. All this is happening in Syria, where, despite the hopes of renewal raised by the new president, Bashir al-Assad, I regret to say that there has been absolutely no increase in consideration for freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you about Riad al-Turk, a political opposition leader who has paid an extremely high price for defending his ideals. The lawyer, now an elderly man in poor health – and we can imagine what it means to spend 20 years in prison in that country – has suffered a deterioration of his health in recent months, since he was arrested again. He is not a familiar face in the West, for he has never tried to claim that his is a special case. He has displayed great dignity throughout his life and he was not even allowed books in prison. In order not to lose all sense of time and reality, he tried to survive and to preserve his concentration by drawing with small stones that he found in his cell. Among those in prison with him are two members of the Syrian parliament, who are being detained on the same charge. These are their crimes: taking part in political meetings not authorised by the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We are scrutinising a key country in the region with interest and we hope that the association agreement being negotiated by the Commission will be concluded. Clearly, however, respect for human rights is an essential condition of these agreements. We therefore expect the European Commission’s negotiators to take a firm stand on the case of the elderly lawyer, Riad al-Turk, as well. It is impossible to put this matter down to cultural diversity: these are basic conditions which a State founded on the rule of law must respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our aim is to establish a constructive dialogue with the Syrian authorities on human rights issues on the basis of the principles expressed in the Barcelona Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Troika demarches were made after the arrests of opposition personalities, including Mr al-Turk, in August/September last year, and after the convictions of the two MPs, Mr al-Homsi and Mr Riad Seif in March/April this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the EC Delegation in Damascus, the Commission also participates in the EU observation of trials. We regret that recently EU observers have on some occasions been excluded from the trial against Mr al-Turk. While we welcome the opportunity to observe trials in Syria, we also realise that the mere presence of observers at trials must not become a substitute for the fairness of court procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission, through its Delegation in Syria, will continue, together with Member States' Embassies, to follow as closely as possible the trial against Mr al-Turk. The Commission will also continue to raise its concerns, regarding both the general human rights situation and individual cases, with the Syrian authorities and will call upon Syria to respect freedom of expression and of association in line with the Barcelona Declaration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the pretext of combating terrorism, Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has made much use of the Internal Security Act, which authorises the detention without trial of anyone suspected of undermining national security, to muzzle all political opposition and to intensify the repressive measures contravening individual freedoms, notably freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few months, we have moved from the image of a country on the up and up, run by civilised people, to that of a country whose leaders are destroying with their own hands what they have built up. That is why Parliament is duty-bound to condemn these abuses and call upon the Malaysian Government not only to guarantee respect for individual freedoms but also to abolish that notorious Internal Security Act and to ratify without delay the International Convention on Human Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention Against Torture.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital that the European Parliament send a mission to Malaysia in order to investigate the conditions under which the political prisoners are being detained and the violations of their basic rights. Finally, the European Union should place this issue on the agendas of the forthcoming meetings between the European Union and the ANASE. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It increasingly resorts to the use of the Internal Security Act, which allows it to detain people indefinitely without trial if, in the Government's view, they are suspected of threatening national security.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights groups have consistently criticised the abuse of this draconian legislation. The High Court of Malaysia has also called for the Parliament to review its use. This resolution quite correctly calls for the abolition of the Internal Security Act and any other laws that permit detention without trial.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that the Government is using the pretext of the crackdown on terrorism as a means of suppressing Government opponents and critics. The repeated use of the Internal Security Act has often been politically motivated and politically selective. It has been used to arrest and detain without trial various members of Malaysian civil society, including opposition leaders, academics, trade unionists and students, frequently without charging them and often denying them access to a lawyer.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution highlights the fact that some 40 political activists have been arrested since 2001 under the Act. The resolution rightly calls for either the release or charging of all political prisoners of conscience, including the six political prisoners specifically named in the resolution, who have been imprisoned for exercising the right to legitimate political organisation and dissent. We want to see them either released or for them to be formally charged and receive an immediate and fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would urge that all future political cooperation with Malaysia be conditional upon the Malaysian Government's abolition of the Internal Security Act and also the release of all political prisoners, so that all Malaysians may be assured that their basic human rights as enshrined in their constitution are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
