The European Union with the support of this Parliament has already done much to raise the technical and operational safety of Soviet-type nuclear reactors and to create independent regulators. As I understand it, what is being done at Temelín has already been done in Finland and there is similar upgrading work in hand at Kozloduy in Bulgaria with the support of a Euratom loan.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like the Commission to confirm, if possible, is if the work at Temelín follows the recommendations of twelve inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and that it will, in fact, create safety standards equivalent to those in our Member States. That is the assurance, or reassurance, that the public in the European Union requires. We have had many messages from the Czech authorities this week. They claim that most of the actions which we request in this resolution have already been carried out and that the remainder are, in fact, under way. Is the Commission in a position to confirm that this afternoon, and if not, will it undertake to supply its views on this matter with urgency to the Industry Committee of the European Parliament? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I believe that in a good family you can also say things that do not suit other members of the family. Nuclear power stations in the European Union have the highest safety standards in the world, and a candidate country that wants to commission a new nuclear power station must, of course, comply with those standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to say that evaluating safety standards at Temelín is a matter for the Czech nuclear regulatory authority. But it is also true to say that during the accession partnership with the Czech Republic, the Commission has identified the implementation of Community legislation on environmental impact assessment as a priority, partly because of Temelín. Nevertheless, although the Czech Republic signed the agreement on cross-border EIA, the Espoo Convention, in 1993, it has still not ratified it. Now, all of a sudden, trial operation is to start at Temelín, with undue haste and in a few days' time, before Germany and Austria, which are neighbouring countries, have received the information requested and before the deeply concerned population of the neighbouring countries has had an opportunity to consider the position and make their objections known to the Czech authorities. That is what the Espoo Convention stipulates, and it is, after all, valid EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Czech Government, indeed I implore it, to take seriously the fears not only of people in neighbouring countries, but also within its own borders. The reactors at Temelín are a Soviet design, VVER1000, and there is nothing Westinghouse can do about that. Please just think about Chernobyl.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal once again to the Czech Government to act voluntarily now in just the same way as they would have to act if they already belonged to the European Union and were a member of our great European family.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the course of 13 project modifications, environmental impact assessment has been simply disregarded. As Mrs Flemming said, it is a long time since the Espoo Convention was signed. It should have been ratified by the Czech Parliament at the beginning of the year and transposed into national law, but this has been indefinitely delayed without any reasons being given.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the constant concerns about safety expressed by the public, in the press and also in private discussions are not being taken seriously. During the last bilateral meetings between Czech, Austrian and German experts on 2 and 5 September this year, it was once again stated that Temelín does not meet German safety standards and would not, therefore, receive an operating licence in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that electricity from Temelín is not intended for internal consumption: it is intended for export, and at dumping prices at that.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the safety of European citizens is at stake here and our responsibility towards them should be adequate grounds for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission says that we do not have any legal options here. Well, the Commission has known that for a long time. Did the Commission expect that somebody would just pull a legal measure out of the hat? No. I expect that the Greens' view will be the well-established one that safety and nuclear power stations are two incompatible concepts.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>The fact of the matter is that there are eastern European nuclear power stations and western European nuclear power stations. Double standards are being applied here, and that must stop. Our friends in the Commission have to accept that you cannot use legal measures alone to solve every single problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore expect the Commission and the Council to demonstrate together the same strong and combined political will that the European Parliament is displaying with this motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on the Technical Group of Independent Members' amendment, which does not include any sensible or new requirements apart from a hint at compromise. I cannot vote for this policy. It is simply populist to gloss over the long-standing failure or lack of interest on the part of politicians towards this issue by threatening a veto – it will not have the desired effect and it will not create a constructive basis for negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety of Europe's citizens and, thus, confidence in the Community should be a priority for us all. Our motion for a resolution is enormously important for the people of Europe and above all for the Czech public. I hope that we will not disappoint them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I deplore the cynical Green exploitation and misrepresentation of the situation. Interference in the internal affairs of a candidate country with the political blackmail of a threat to veto accession to the EU is wholly unacceptable. I regret that people in Austria have allowed themselves to be ruled by emotion, not rational scientific argument. The Czechs show every sign of behaving responsibly and properly according to internationally accepted standards, and we should leave them to get on with it.

But having heard Mr Chichester, I think it is worth reiterating that we have to pay serious attention to the wishes and concerns of the people of Europe, and of Austria in particular, as regards nuclear energy. This applies especially to the Temelín nuclear power station. My group is supporting this motion for a resolution on Temelín for reasons of principle, because we take the people's concerns seriously and because many of us have, for a long time, been actively fighting against nuclear energy in the East and in the West.</p>
<p class="contents">The political battle against the Zwentendorf nuclear power station in Austria has had an enduring formative influence on me personally, so I did not need to be convinced by the conservative arguments in the Austrian media over the last few days which I have followed with surprise and sometimes with quiet amusement.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Echerer, I oppose the single, very vaguely worded amendment, because I believe that the phrase ‘high level’ does not mean anything, because the Czech Republic itself is surely aware of the need for a high level of safety. I therefore fully support the motion for a resolution before us and oppose the amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, I am an old opponent of nuclear power and have for many years been a member of the board of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate. On the other hand, I am chairman of the Delegation to the Joint EU-Czech Republic Parliamentary Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore quickly like to say three things. First of all: concern about nuclear power means that safety will not only be good but that it will, at all times, be as good as it possibly can be. Secondly, the same rules naturally apply to the Czech Republic as apply to other candidate States and, in the long run, to Member States. Thirdly, this resolution ought to be seen as part of an open dialogue with the Czech Republic, a dialogue we are conducting within the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Committee but which ought also to be possible to conduct in our respective parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">We must broaden out this debate, which is part and parcel of our democracy. This ought not, however, to lead to hard feelings between the Czech Republic and the Member States of the EU. I hope that the Czechs are able to give positive answers to all the questions and that a favourable solution can in that way be found to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that case, the radiation was not confined to the Ukraine, nor was it simply a bilateral problem. I know that there are both advocates and opponents of nuclear power in the European Union, and that there is no common line. And, above all, there are no uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations. There is an urgent need for action here if our credibility is to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">However, after the Chernobyl experience we have to ask if it really is possible to bring a nuclear power plant, Temelín, on line in the heart of Europe when it still has significant limitations in terms of safety. The Czech Republic is trying to present us with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> in commissioning Temelín. If you will forgive my saying so, this sort of behaviour falls far short of a spirit of partnership. Edmund Stoiber was quite right when he said today that it is a matter of following the house rules.</p>
<p class="contents">A resolution was adopted in the Austrian Parliament this Tuesday by all the parties – all the parties, mark you – emphasising that approval could only be given to the completion of the accession negotiations if the Temelín plant is retrofitted. I wish to make one thing quite clear: we support the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU. But the conditions must be right. I call on you to support our motion for a resolution, the content of which is identical to the four-party resolution adopted in the Austrian Parliament. After all, it must be our objective for nuclear power stations to have the highest possible safety standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it can help to defuse the battle of words between the two sides somewhat, than it will certainly have served its purpose. I regret that the Czech Republic is unable to defend itself here and present its case, as it is always good to hear both sides of such a complicated argument.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the same spirit of openness I would also like to say that I do not think it is right for the Austrian Government and Parliament to be delivering a kind of ultimatum here. That is not the way we have handled these things in the European Union up to now. It is quite evident that there is a problem, but if we start issuing ultimatums then the next thing will be that a delegation will arrive representing displaced persons and demand that the Czech Republic can only join the Union if the Benesch Decrees are withdrawn. And then some other group will come along demanding something else. You have to be careful with ultimatums like this. There are other ways of solving such problems. But I would also like to suggest to the Czech Republic that they should pay serious attention to the concerns expressed by the German Association for Nuclear Safety. That was another point I wanted to make.</p>
<p class="contents">My last, but important point, is one for the Commission. We hear a lot about environmental impact, and that is fine. But we also have the Euratom Treaty. Article 37 of that Treaty effectively stipulates that the Commission must be kept informed about any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in any form whatsoever. The Commission also has to determine whether the implementation of such a plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Czech Republic does not yet belong to the European Union. Nevertheless, I would be interested to know what the Commission's view is in relation to this article, and whether it considers that the Czech Republic has respected it. It would be interesting, as Gordon Adam has already asked, to know what its view is on the environmental impact assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has repeatedly stressed the importance of candidate countries adhering to a high level of nuclear safety in line with relevant Council resolutions. The Commission is actively participating in the deliberations of the Council aimed at assessing and ensuring a high level of nuclear safety in candidate countries as a key requirement for accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility for licensing nuclear installations lies with the Czech nuclear regulatory authority. The Commission has cooperated with the Czech authorities in order to reinforce the authority's capacities. The Czech authorities have ensured that the operating licence for Unit 1 of the Temelín nuclear power plant will not be issued until all outstanding problems are solved to the satisfaction of the nuclear regulatory authority.</p>
<p class="contents">According to current Czech legislation, an environmental impact assessment is required before the operating licence is issued. The Commission expects this provision to be enforced by the Czech authorities. Mr Adams asks whether the Czechs took account of the IAEA's inspections and views. The answer is ‘yes’. The IAEA has reviewed the modifications made to the safety systems by the Czechs following the IAEA's programmes. The IAEA concluded that the issues were properly addressed by the Czechs.</p>
