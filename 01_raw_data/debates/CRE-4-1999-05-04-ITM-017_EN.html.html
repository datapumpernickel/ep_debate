<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corbett </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by presenting the apologies of the rapporteur who could not be with us tonight. It is quite well known now that the Amsterdam Treaty extends the codecision procedure from some 15 articles to 38 articles under the Treaty, so that most non‐agricultural legislation will be subject to codecision. This actually changes the legislative authority of the European Union into a real bicameral legislative authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam also changes the procedure itself, and that is less well known, to provide for absolute equality between Parliament and the Council throughout the procedure. Something that was first thought of by yourself, Mr President, when you worked on the Martin reports. I had the privilege of working with you in those days on that. The first drafts were made of a possible future codecision procedure, always envisaging equality between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have that for most legislation. That is very important. It means that to be adopted European legislation now has to pass two hurdles, two tests as to the quality and the acceptability of such legislation. It must be acceptable to a majority of the elected governments sitting in the Council and a majority of the directly elected MEPs in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament brings greater diversity to the examination of European legislation. After all, in Parliament you have not just government ministers coming from their national capitals but also elected representatives from all the regions of all the Member States, from governing and opposition parties in their full diversity and plurality. Imagine for one moment the European system without the European Parliament. It would be totally dominated by diplomats, technocrats and bureaucrats, with ministers occasionally flying into Brussels to try and keep track of what is happening. The fact that you have at the heart of the decision‐taking system a body of full‐time representatives in that full diversity that they represent, knocking on doors, making phone calls, asking awkward questions, probing, questioning, going through matters in detail and going back to their regions to talk about it with interest groups, trade unions, employers, consumer groups and local governments in their regions. That is what brings full pluralism, diversity, openness and democracy to the European system. Recognising that now by giving Parliament equal status with the Council in the codecision procedure, is a tremendous step forward for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes which were made to the old procedure are threefold: the elimination of the so‐called negative version of the third reading, whereby if there was no agreement in conciliation the Council could go ahead and adopt its own text and challenge Parliament to reject that by an absolute majority within six weeks. That unbalanced the procedure in favour of the Council, even if it was rarely used – the Council only tried it once, we rejected it and the Council never tried it again. Nonetheless, it was an unhealthy part of the procedure. That goes with Amsterdam – full equality, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Simple rejection by Parliament when we are opposed to a text instead of a two‐phased rejection is now possible under the Amsterdam Treaty – simpler, easier and puts Parliament in a stronger position.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the possibility for first‐reading agreements. These changes, as I said, put us in a position of equality but they also necessitated a revision of the 1993 agreement on the operation of the procedure. I am very pleased – and I must congratulate Vice‐Presidents Imbeni, Fontaine and Verde, Ken Collins, De Giovanni and the rapporteur whom I am replacing, on the text they have negotiated with the other institutions. It is a good text: practical and flexible. It goes beyond the 1993 text, which was limited to conciliation: it covers the whole codecision procedure in full. Let us not forget that most codecisions result in agreement without needing the Conciliation Committee, so it is very important that has been brought into the text.</p>
<p class="contents">It recognises the practice that the negotiations do not take place 15 plus 15 but in a smaller group: the committee chair and rapporteur with the Council President and the Commission, then reporting back to the full Conciliation Committee. It allows for first‐reading agreements and it tries to draw the Council into a dialogue with us in the first reading, as we have recently done in our new Rules of Procedure as well to encourage that sort of dialogue at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, but above all, right the way through the text it recognises the equality of Parliament and the Council: the committee is to be chaired jointly; it will meet alternately on Council premises and on Parliament premises; texts have to be signed jointly by the two chairmen; letters have to be signed by the two chairmen; even the juridical linguistic review by the staff will now be jointly between Parliament and the Council. All this recognises the equality of the two institutions and, as I said earlier, sets up this new era where we are two parts of a bicameral legislative authority at European level.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Frischenschlager </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span><span class="italic"> – (DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Corbett is not only due credit for having done such an excellent job in taking over from the original rapporteur; he has also described in great detail the practical developments and progress made on the codecision procedure, which forms the basis of this report. I do not want to go into this now, though I would like to take the opportunity to point out one thing: however much we have progressed as a result of Amsterdam on the practical aspects of parliamentarianism, we must nevertheless not overlook the fact that important elements which constitute genuine parliamentary government are still absent in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of the third pillar, which is particularly important for human rights and the nation state, and on which there is admittedly a timetable due to the Treaty, but the political discussion about giving Parliament greater powers in the third pillar is in fact lacking. Moreover, it should be mentioned that our Member States still consider it unreasonable to subject agricultural policy to a decision by Parliament, particularly in the area of the budget, and our power of codecision is still very much underdeveloped when it comes to amending the Treaty. I just wanted to mention these points because they are important to me. We want a strong European Union with a strong Commission and Parliament, since this is what guarantees a democratic European Union. A powerful European Union can only be a democratic one, and we must therefore continue our efforts to give Parliament greater powers in the European Union and not give up on this. This should also be mentioned briefly on this occasion.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span> <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is fortunate, as Mr Corbett pointed out earlier, that this sitting is being chaired by Mr Martin as he is a great expert on institutional issues. All of us that have worked with him over the years have benefited from his experience and I personally have benefited from that wonderful report he presented during the parliamentary term that began in 1989. This is why I should like to pay homage to him now. I should also like to congratulate Mr Manzella and Mr Corbett as well as the negotiators from the three institutions on their excellent work and on having been able to strike a balance between a dynamic application of the provisions and the obligation to fully respect the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The working methods formally approved and adopted by the Commission seem particularly useful for several reasons. First, they offer the institutions the opportunity to conclude any legislative codecision procedure at first reading, as provided for in the Treaty, provided they have reached an agreement, as is only logical. It is precisely during this first stage that the institutions can fully exercise their powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the Commission participates fully throughout the procedure and, in particular, can play an important role as mediator during the conciliation phase. In my view, its responsibility in this area should be enhanced in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">And lastly, I believe that the key to success in developing the legislative procedure lies in close and flexible interinstitutional cooperation. Moreover, with the application of the new Treaty, this agreement marks the end of what could be termed a test or trial period for the codecision procedure and Parliament"s role as a co‐legislator. The success of the codecision procedure in the first years of its application was a clear signal to the last Intergovernmental Conference that it should be extended to cover almost all the main legislative activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Codecision has now become the general rule and Parliament"s role as a co‐legislator has been consolidated. I think we should be pleased in this respect because democracy has, in fact, been strengthened as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the codecision procedure in the Amsterdam Treaty, we should firstly look at the possibility of concluding the legislative procedure at first reading in a positive light. This should speed up legislative decision‐making and, as a consequence, enable us to advance along the road mapped out by the institutions following the Single European Act. In spite of the exceptions which still exist, the duration of the Union"s legislative procedures is quite reasonable, generally speaking, particularly if we compare it to national procedures. Sometimes the European Parliament works even faster.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards conciliation, it is important to emphasise that the procedures have been streamlined. Should Parliament and the Council fail to reach agreement, the draft lapses. This confirms the European Parliament"s responsibility and prevents totally futile disputes between the two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in practice we can see that the clause that provided the Council with a last attempt to overcome the European Parliament"s opposition has never been seriously used. In this way, we also wanted to put an end to the lack of confidence surrounding the European Parliament"s decision‐making abilities, which centred mainly on bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the end of small‐scale conciliation is absolutely vital to the process of simplification. Similarly, the possibility of inviting the European Parliament to hold a debate before finally rejecting a proposal is no longer essential given that the political debate among the political groups and the institutions can begin at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless believe that a key element of the reform is the extension of the range of issues that come under the codecision procedure. I do not know if such an extension is sufficient or incomplete, and I feel it may be necessary to go further in certain areas. What is vital in my view is to accept the Commission"s proposal that states that no legislative act can be adopted in the Community without the European Parliament"s approval. The new Treaty confirms that, in principle, the areas in which codecision is not the general rule are exceptions to the system.</p>
<p class="contents">So the future Parliament is faced with a legislative task that entails greater responsibility. At the same time, the political debate is being stepped up and this should increase the public"s confidence in the institutions, which is essential at this moment in time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission approved the text of the joint declaration in its meeting of 9 March and the Council approved it last week. It is now Parliament"s turn to add its support so as to enable the three Presidents to confirm the agreement of their institutions in a joint declaration at a signing ceremony this week.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on behalf of the Commission, I would ask you to agree to this declaration.</p>
