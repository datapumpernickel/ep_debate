<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sturdy (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, it is a pleasure to see the Commissioner here. I may well disagree with his proposals but I wish to begin by saying that we believe that Commissioner Fischler is an excellent Agriculture Commissioner, although he might have got this report slightly wrong. That is no criticism of Mr Fischler himself. It is well known that we need to address the serious problem facing the beef industry, and that is certainly what brought about the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Commissioner that there is a Byzantine proverb: for those who have food, there are many problems; for those who have not, there is only one problem, and it is, of course, a great problem when there is too much beef in the marketplace. This is exactly what the Commissioner is trying to address. However, in my opinion as rapporteur, he has missed the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy for me to stand here and criticise, but what I tried to do in my report was to be constructive and move the situation forward – I realise that the Commissioner does not agree with some of the measures. I hope that when the Commissioner addresses us he will perhaps answer one question: Will the 15 Council members agree with the Commission's proposals? I think they might not. I should like to know whether the view of the Commission is that they will agree with the Commission's proposals or not.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the one thing that was voted out in the Committee on Agriculture that I believe was a mistake was the 90-head limit. One of the major problems that we have – and the Commissioner is quite right that we have a problem with overproduction and we have pushed forward the proposals to allow the intervention limits to be raised – is that by changing the 90-head limit there is a real risk that we cut off some of those producers in their prime. I say to those Members who do not understand agriculture that to raise a beef animal from conception to the actual marketplace takes somewhere in the region of three years. It is a very long process. You cannot switch off something like that overnight and just say: well, hang on a minute, these cattle cannot be supported because suddenly we have changed our minds. If the Commissioner cannot at least change that 90-head limit – and we hope that one of the amendments may help us; we are looking at that at the moment – then at least he should look at helping those farmers who are affected by the 90-head limit so that they can adjust, because agriculture is a long-term process, not a short-term process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen the effects of BSE. This is again why I am concerned a little about the report. As the Commissioner knows, BSE has been a major problem in the United Kingdom. It has been the archetype of the BSE crisis. We got through it and with careful construction we brought our market back. It was rather unfortunate that foot-and-mouth disease played a part in destroying the very work that had been done to get the marketplace back, bearing in mind that foot and mouth has nothing to do with food, in as much as it is of no danger to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commissioner not to make knee-jerk reactions, because I believe this is a knee-jerk reaction. At the moment I cannot accept the new amendments tabled. I have a great concern that we are trying to move away from the real issues here. As I said, it is easy to stand here and criticise and I hope the Commissioner takes on board the amendments. The question we ask is whether or not the proposals satisfy the requirements: I believe a few of the Commission's proposals do but the majority fall short. I leave the Commissioner with one last thought: if he finds it impossible to accept Parliament's proposals, then he may wish to see the report referred back to the Committee on Agriculture. Then we could rediscuss it, because we have put forward some good proposals and if it is a wish of this august House that it be referred back, then so be it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This plan was published on 13 February and was, therefore, unable to take into account the crisis caused by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, two areas infected with which were discovered in the United Kingdom in February. In these circumstances, I believe it should be stressed to the House that the current number of cases already represents a potential cost of over EUR 170 million, and that, on 8 May, the Commission quite rightly proposed establishing a reserve of EUR 1 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">This new crisis to hit European farmers has three major consequences. The first is a direct cost to the Community budget, which still has not been defined but which is regularly increased. The second is a negative impact on beef and veal consumption and exports and lastly, the third is an impact on animal destruction programmes and, as a result, on slaughter costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Commission’s proposals, we must therefore be well aware that we are up against a major problem. All the financial forecasts of beef consumption and exports are approximate, since they do not take into account the consequences of the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view, therefore, that beef and veal consumption in 2001 will, unfortunately, fall by more than the 10.8%, forecast by the Commission. It is also unlikely that exports in 2001 will reach 60% of the GATT limit.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial requirements could well, therefore, be higher than the Commission’s forecasts. We all understand that, in normal circumstances, financial inaccuracies would have been enough to justify a refusal but, given the urgent nature of the situation, the Committee on Budgets decided to support the Commission’s proposal and it hoped that Parliament would approve the amendments, as the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been able to, thanks to the excellent work by Robert Sturdy, while requesting a prior consultation of the budgetary authority should the costs incurred need to be revised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is universally accepted that, in view of the fall in beef consumption, cattle farming cannot be sustained at the accustomed level. But let me say, Commissioner, that the burden of this reduction must not be distributed unfairly to the detriment of particular regions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to speak about a new regime of premium entitlements, we cannot base such a regime on an absolute ceiling, as the Commission proposes, but on a solution that is reasonable for all farms, a point that Mr Sturdy has already made. Such a solution can only be based on the amount of available grassland or, perhaps better still, on the input of working hours, in other words on the number of farmhands employed in accordance with the laws and regulations – and let me stress that last proviso.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, if you remember, we have held this discussion already. We held it when we were discussing the organisation of the market in beef and veal in the context of the debate on Agenda 2000. But when you write, Commissioner Fischler, in your reply to a letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that there is only one derogation from the 90-head rule in the new <span class="italic">Länder </span>of the Federal Republic of Germany and that the reduction there ought now to result in structural change, you are missing the point that the number of persons employed in agriculture in those regions has fallen in the last ten years from 800 000 to 150 000. May I say to the Commission that this is quite enough structural change! Or, if I may resort to sarcasm, do you perhaps want to solve the beef problem at the expense of these new <span class="italic">Länder </span>in eastern Germany, thereby ensuring that the farms there will be forced to shut down? Why, in fact, can we not contemplate a tighter squeeze on premium payments on the basis of stocking density per hectare of forage area? You have provided for a reduction from 2 to 1.8 livestock units. But I should like to see a different system, one which would render the 90-head premium limit superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">Just imagine it were left to the farmer’s discretion to decide how drastically he cut down the number of his cattle below the density threshold at which premiums became payable. For this, however, the farmer would have to receive an additional compensatory payment corresponding to the extent of the voluntary reduction. This could be called beef set-aside, by analogy with fruit and vegetable production, because we spend considerable amounts on set-aside premiums for non-production in those domains too. If this system were to result in a lower level of beef production, it would be right and proper for us to reward those farmers who trim the size of their herds in such a natural way instead of producing surpluses which cannot be marketed and may even have to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, Commissioner, you could take to this idea. Your conversion need not be immediate! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly because, while the Community cattle sector is hoping for measures to solve the crisis it is facing, only two of the measures in this package appear to be appropriate for resolving one particular crisis, that is, the Commission’s budgetary crisis in relation to solving it. Only the removal of the ceiling on public intervention of 350 000 tonnes for meat, with a view to preventing the implementation of the so-called safety network intervention system, seems to be a genuine crisis measure, as well as the measure – already approved by the management committee for meat on 16 March – of introducing a new intervention method for the sale and storage of animals of more than 30 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to say also, Commissioner, that this measure does little to improve consumer confidence and to resolve the market problems, since we are storing meat which will later have to enter the market, thereby creating significant imbalances within that market.</p>
<p class="contents">The other five measures are really directed at the sector, but they are not urgent and they can enter into force and have their effects in the short and medium term. These measures should really have been proposed with the calmness required for a reform in a sector suffering such a deep crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must be absolutely critical in relation to two of them. One is the removal of the national limit on premiums for male cattle by means of individual laws; I believe that this measure is wrong and would lead us to a market of quotas, which would be closed and narrow, and would do absolutely nothing for the transparency and simplification of the CAP nor a future reform of this sector. The other is the restriction of production, as intended, by means of the reduction in the premium for suckler cows.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this proposal, which lays down that, in order to receive the premium for suckler cows, between 20 and 40% of the animals for which the premium is requested must be heifers, is intended to reduce the quantity of meat available on the market; but what it removes is quality meat which originates from herds of suckler cows bred within extensive systems. This measure therefore has the completely wrong objective and is clearly contrary to the often-repeated objective of Community agricultural policy promoting extensive agriculture.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, necessary to intervene in some respects in order to remedy the problems that do after all exist in the beef sector, but I would like to emphasise that consumers’ lack of confidence has nothing to do with whether meat is produced on an intensive or extensive basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that a reintroduction of the 90-head limit will have very serious consequences for some countries in particular. It will result in more bureaucracy and it will not provide any relief whatsoever in connection with the consumption of beef, which is after all what we need just now. With regard to the buy-up scheme, I would like to say that it is not an aim in itself to buy up animals in order either to put them into cold storage or subsequently destroy them. Consequently, we have proposed that we donate the healthy tested beef to areas that need crisis help. We can do this very easily for the costs associated with the intervention buy-up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, then, like to draw the Chamber’s attention to the fact that the proposal to tighten up the stocking density requirement, namely by reducing the number of livestock units per hectare from 2 to 1.8, will not have the desired effect either. Nonetheless, we agree that the intervention ceiling should be abolished for the years 2001 and 2002. However, with these few but – I hope, Commissioner – clear comments, we would like to support your proposal but, at the same time, also draw attention to the fact that we should not, through the new decisions we make, contribute to maintaining the distortion of competition that currently exists between some of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The slaughter programme has gone through the administrative process, and we dealt with clover ley here in a debate on matters of topical and urgent importance. So let us now concentrate on the things that remain to be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">I essentially wish to confine my remarks to the 90-head limit. It should be made clear that this ceiling already applies in Europe but is not compulsory. That was the big mistake in Berlin. It would have been better to have adopted the proposal we made in Parliament at that time to the effect that there should be an additional mechanism in the degressive premium model to make allowance for the cost of labour. This idea has now been taken up again, as the speakers from the other groups have made clear. I hope the Commission will adopt this proposal, so that we can give farms with higher livestock populations the opportunity at least to adjust this 90-head limit. As a result, larger farms with species-related husbandry methods involving additional labour inputs would have a means of obtaining reimbursement of their costs. I believe we would then have made this limit less rigid as well as having introduced an enlightened social factor. I hope that the House agrees and that it will vote accordingly tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its aim was to sever the link between aid and production levels in the relevant product markets while keeping the loss of income and jobs within reasonable bounds, an aim which was formulated at a time when the restructuring process seemed destined to run fairly smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">After the outbreaks of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the beef and veal markets collapsed with no sign of an early return to stability. Farmers are counting on the additional special funds being provided now rather than disappearing in an interminable bureaucratic labyrinth. The promises made in the initial weeks of the crisis regarding the special purchase scheme must first be honoured. Incorporating this scheme into long-term plans to alter the organisation of the market in beef and veal will exacerbate the financial situation of beef producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The present draft amendment to the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal essentially fulfils the Commission’s aim of reducing the oversupply of these products. Some of the proposals, however, have nothing at all to do with the consequences of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease. The quality of products is not automatically better if a farm is bigger or is managed in a particular way. Present market trends are unlikely to act as an incentive to invest in beef production. The fixing of any form of ceiling for the payment of support is therefore an unwarranted additional financial burden on those who have already made investments. Farmers depend on this income, and the 90-head limit will certainly be resisted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve this goal, I feel that, first and foremost, it is vital for the institutions to ensure that the information they issue is correct and that appropriate terms are used to inform the public about BSE. Talking about contamination, mad cow disease or infected meat does nothing to encourage the consumer to buy beef or veal. BSE was not caused by a virus or a bacterium, and so we must prevent the use of inappropriate terminology generating phobias or psychosis among consumers. What I am saying is part of the debate seeking to ensure that consumers are provided with correct, comprehensive information without creating futile panic. Ensuring that information issued is correct is the most effective way of encouraging consumers to start buying beef and veal again, and this is much more important than any economic support the European Union may provide or any subsidising of farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The huge drop in the consumption of beef and veal as a result of the BSE crisis has put the price of meat under heavy pressure, and consumption and exports have fallen even further in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis. It is evident that the sector needs help. However, the contingency plan suggested by the Commission appears to be a plan which will only restrict the production of beef and veal in the long term. Commissioner, changing a common organisation of the market to have a long-term effect is something which we would term a reform, rather than a contingency plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy has included a number of amendments in his report which could serve as a contingency plan, namely by encouraging cattle breeders to have bulls slaughtered while they are still calves. The measure to restrict animal premiums per cattle farm to a maximum of 90 animals, provided that the number of livestock units is reduced from 2 to 1.8 per hectare, will cut down production in due course. The fact is, however, that, in this way, cattle farmers are not only affected by the existing crisis, they are also being hit financially by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore also support the amendments which propose increasing the premium for animals in proportion to the reduction in the number of livestock units, so that the financial incentive to produce more is actually being taken away from farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Abolishing the intervention ceiling, a purchase scheme to which the Member States contribute, will enable the Commission to exercise the highest possible level of influence on the market price. It keeps the costly safety net principle, which is funded 100% from the EU budget, at bay for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Sturdy, I am in favour of storing, rather than destroying, the meat purchased. I would remind this Parliament of the foot and mouth resolution which it adopted in April and which urged that healthy animals should not be destroyed.</p>

I understand the reasons behind this proposal and especially its timing, but I think it is quite inadequate, for the following reasons: first of all, I find it unacceptable that the special premium for male cattle should be reduced, if only temporarily. For the sake of reducing production, this measure would penalise Member States that are still net importers of meat, which is the case of my own country. Secondly, it is hard to understand the creation of the special system of intervention buying for meat from animals over thirty months old either from the point of view of consumer confidence or that of cost, given that, even in a few months, it will still be impossible to dispose of meat that is stockpiled now. It would be more sensible to buy these animals in order to destroy the meat. Thirdly, encouraging extensive production makes sense but this must be accompanied with a special premium entitlement for small farms, which will not benefit from these incentives because they cover too small an area. We are insisting once again on applying the ‘one size fits all’ approach, as if all farms had the same capacity to adapt and to survive. Finally, authorising organic farmers to use set-aside land for fodder – the subject of Mrs Auroi’s report – can only be seen as symbolic at a time when producers are facing increased feed costs for their livestock. Why are we not allowing farmers to use set-aside land for protein crops? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are faced with several problems: we need to address the imbalance in the beef and veal market, support farmers’ income and restore consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to addressing the imbalance between supply and demand, first of all, I would like to point out that no one here and that includes the Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture is suggesting that we leave it simply to the effects of the free market. I would like to think that the need to regulate supply, as we have to do today, will also be uppermost in our minds when we tackle the new, further-reaching reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the issue that we are dealing with today and in view of the reduced level that production must fall to, I would like to stress how crucial it is that we find a balance in the division of efforts required, on the one hand, by suckler herds and milk herds, and by industrial rearing methods and farms using grazing. It would be ironic, just when the need to produce quality beef and veal by encouraging the use of grass is acknowledged, if it is the traditional suckler herds that are the cause of the main expenses of this COM’s new adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask that the 90 head limit be reinstated in order to qualify for the special premium, which supports the Commission’s point of view. I am not neglecting the fact that the Member States who have waived this limit as part of Agenda 2000 could come up against some problems. Since Amendment No 12 of Article 1 introduces the possibility of taking into account wage costs, however, I believe that this measure is fair.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, I believe that the farmers who are already being penalised by the fall in market prices must not be punished further by a reduction in government support for cutting their numbers of cows per hectare. I would also like to draw the Commission and the Council’s attention to this issue so that the level of premiums per hectare of forage area remains unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other points, naturally, I would also like to voice my support for not applying the ceiling for buying into public intervention of 350 000 tonnes of beef and veal per year in 2001 and 2002 as well as my support for the steps advocated by the rapporteur to promote beef and veal products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We understand that these concerns have abated somewhat in recent weeks and that consumption forecasts have now improved significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission still believes that emergency measures should be introduced to inhibit over-supply in the beef and veal sector then these changes should not jeopardise the long-term future of the quality, grass-fed beef sector. For this reason we would oppose any alteration to the existing rules for suckler cow premia and beef special premia. Attention should instead – in our view – be focused on the removal of surplus calves from the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst respecting the aims of Agenda 2000 we would therefore seek renewed justification from the Commission of the need for such radical proposals and would call for the re-evaluation of these measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reform of Europe's beef regime is necessary for market balance and the restoration of consumer confidence. It must, however, be done in a manner which safeguards the interests of family farming as distinct from intensive production. Reasonable margins for farmers must be central to any restructuring proposals. Without farmers we will not have a beef sector. Already, many farmers are leaving the sector. It is right to plan the future of Europe's beef sector based on extensification and traceability. As regards trade liberalisation, I wonder what steps will be taken to protect European producers from the unfair competition from third country imports where the same rules do not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">I have serious reservations about the individualisation of the male beef premia. It is complicated and administratively difficult. Likewise on supply control, it is wrong to target the suckler herd which is the foundation of quality beef production. The proposal to set up a national purchase scheme should, in my view, be re-examined. In the present climate the storage of beef for later sale will hot help to reduce volume, and do little for consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it would be wrong to draw panic conclusions – as Mr Sturdy already said – on the long-term sustainability of Europe's beef sector during this very depressed period resulting from the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that our institutions concentrate on developing a European production model, a model that must, of course, suit many different national situations which, in some parts of Europe, have different production characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to comment very briefly on the Sturdy report itself. Firstly, we consider it essential to limit the effect that would arise if the Member States were given the possibility of amending or derogating from the ceiling of 90 head per holding. This production increase is, in actual fact, insignificant, while the derogation is essential in certain production contexts and does not in itself contribute to production intensification. Similarly, the plan to introduce individual rights into the system of special premiums does not appear to take account of the usual production customs of large parts of the Community, which are characterised by the presence of specialised holdings which do not manage the entire breeding cycle but only the last stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the light, apart from anything else, of the definitive ban on animal meals and of the requirement to use vegetable proteins alone, there will have to be a heated debate on the Blair House Agreement and it will have to be revised on the basis of the requirements of European production.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we consider extremely important the support and enhancement and promotion actions implemented across the sectors. It is just as important that we attempt to do this on a Community basis, above all, rather than on a national basis as before, because it is only in Europe that we can provide a response to the demands and requirements of the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, one of the seven measures that you proposed several months ago is today being proposed for implementation. This is, in addition to using set-aside land to grow protein plants, a step in the right direction, even if, in the opinion of the Group of the Greens, it is still not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sturdy has tried to push the Commission position on farmers further, by dealing with other aspects of beef production. On the other hand, he has not considered a serious problem of fraud in the BSE crisis. Now, Commissioner, I suppose that you too have seen the latest report by AFSSA (the French Agency for Food Safety), which has been well-documented and is damning on this issue. It shows that the cases of animals suffering from BSE, described as naïve and, more often, extremely dumb, are caused by the fraudulent use of bone meal from carcasses in animal foods. We therefore need urgent measures to step up checks and sanctions. The health of consumers depends on this, as does consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to draw your attention to is that the measures proposed by the Commission are moving towards extensification whilst relieving a saturated market, but there is a risk that the special premium for cutting headage of male cattle per hectare will have no effect unless a ceiling is imposed on surface areas, since the advocates of high productivity may attempt to claw back this premium, which is not intended for them, by increasing surface areas, which are, in any case, already high in their case. We should therefore do our best to encourage small holdings, which are endangered and threatened by the latest food crises, and this is what I hope you will soon be doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When Commissioner Fischler passes, as all of us must, to the other side – although not for a long time I trust – and he meets St. Francis of Assisi who asks him: ‘Commissioner, why so much slaughter for nothing? Why so many animals stored without ever getting to market?’ what will he reply?</p>
<p class="contents">What I mean is that we have arrived at a certain point. We are in a period of crisis. Of course, compensation has to be paid, including to the holdings responsible for the crisis, if they are not to go under completely. But, at the same time, we need to break away from the outmoded concept of industrialised, intensive livestock farming.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I think that, while dealing with the crisis, the Commission’s measures should look to find an alternative model. And a distinction should be made between the countries which are responsible for the crisis, which invented BSE, and the countries which protected and still protect the European Union, between importing countries and countries which saturate the market with exports and ruin the budget and between small and large companies, so that we can move towards a model of small, ecological livestock holdings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank goodness for that! In my view, their absence from the front pages will do more than anything else to restore consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, I should like to appeal to you to accept the amendments in the Sturdy report, because referring the report back to committee after the vote would only cause delays, as far as I can see. I could not explain such delays to the farmers, consumers and voters back home. What are we actually asking for? The first thing is that the goalposts should not be shifted in the middle of the game. The rules were laid down in Berlin. We are calling for the reintroduction of a limit of 90 head of cattle. I believe this is something upon which all of us, from our widely diverse regions, really must continue to insist at the present juncture. As for the plan to reduce the stocking density to 1.8 livestock units per hectare from 1 January 2002, I must tell you in all honesty that I am also at a loss to explain this to the farmers in my region.</p>
<p class="contents">Another lesson we must learn relates to the repeated references to alternative production methods. I believe that organic farms are a good thing, but they are no panacea, because we are already seeing that there is too little purchasing power and too few markets for their produce. It is my opinion that the amendments could be accepted as they stand – time forbids me to repeat the wording of each one – from my point of view and perhaps from your perspective too.</p>
<p class="contents">And last but not least, our guiding principle throughout this sector should be the need to produce safe food. Safety cannot be regulated with premiums. Safe products are the key to the restoration of a stable beef and veal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also call upon the Commission to accept the recommendations. Otherwise the report should be referred back to committee, because the key to European beef production is quality, and that is what we can sell to the consumer. I think we have to take out the poor-quality calves that are born so that in the long run we can produce quality beef. An attack on suckler cows and their numbers is exactly the wrong way to go, because this is very much quality, grass-fed beef, in which the consumer has great confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take a much more positive approach to selling beef again. I think the UK has shown that. We have now returned to consumption above that of the 1996 level, therefore we need to move forward. The 90-head limit is wrong and to bring in individual claims will be a bureaucratic nightmare. We really have to move forward. Destruction is also the key. If you are going to have a buy-up scheme for the over thirty-month cattle, then for goodness sake destroy them, do not bring them back onto the market at a future date, because this will be lower-quality beef, and if you are not very careful, this will actually destroy the future recovery of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Busk made a good point. If these cattle over thirty months old are tested and found not to have BSE, why cannot they be provided as aid in the future. Why do we have then to destroy them? What we cannot do is to put them onto the European market. So I think the long-term solution is to take on board Robert Sturdy's report. Let us go out and sell good-quality European beef to the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I regard the introduction of this rule as an entirely desirable step, for two reasons: firstly, because it releases funds which we could use to assist smaller farms and family holdings wherever possible and, secondly, because it accords with a certain principle of equality.</p>
<p class="contents">In our economic legislation we have support systems for enterprises with up to 50 employees, for enterprises with up to 250 employees and for those enterprises with a payroll in excess of 250 employees. In the farming world, I do not see the logic behind the special treatment of large agricultural holdings. It seems to me that our policies will not bear fruit in the future unless we make a point of supporting the small and family-run farms, the protection of the landscape and environmentally beneficial soil cultivation, especially in ecologically sensitive areas, instead of pouring a considerable percentage of our financial resources into large farming businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is no justification for us in the long term to go on having the lion’s share of our aid resources creamed off by farms with thousands of animals, nor will the people of Europe accept such a situation. I therefore hope that the Commission’s proposal will be adopted. I know that my opinion differs from those of my group and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but I nevertheless hope that we can keep the 90-head rule as proposed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the estimates we have received from the Member States, consumption is now about 10% down on pre-crisis levels. Some non-EU countries have also relaxed their import bans.</p>
<p class="contents">These encouraging signals, however, must not obscure the facts that even a 10% drop in consumption represents an enormous challenge and that there is still a considerable surfeit of beef cattle because of the lower number of animals being slaughtered. Moreover, there is also the need to cope with the volume of meat that is already in storage and the volume awaiting storage, not to mention the loss of income that farmers have suffered. We must therefore continue to do everything in our power to restore the equilibrium of the cattle market. There is no alternative to radical action such as the Commission has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me say once again that the purpose of the proposals before us is crisis management; it is not a matter of bringing forward the agricultural reforms. The emergency measures taken by the Commission have already removed more than 400 000 tonnes of beef from the market in the first four months of this year. Slightly more than half of this meat has been put into storage. The proposals before us now relate to further measures for the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address my special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, for his excellent work, which he had to produce within a very short space of time, into the bargain. Mr Sturdy, you said, ‘I tried to be constructive’. I would say you were constructive. The amendments contain several statements with which I fully concur. These include the statement in Amendment No 5 to the effect that meat we have bought in can be donated as food aid and the call in Amendment No 9 for the financial ceiling set in Berlin not to be exceeded. However, since we have already taken account of the food-aid option and since the Berlin ceiling is set in stone anyway, there is no need to include these points in the recitals of the draft regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to note from your Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 10 that you do not support either my proposal for the introduction of individual ceilings for the special premium or my proposal for a reduction in the overall level of these premiums. I was very interested, however, to read your proposal in Amendment No 12 that holdings which breach the 90-head limit should be eligible for premiums worth up to 50% of the wages incurred in cattle rearing. Although the technicalities of its implementation would be very complex, I shall nevertheless bear this proposal in mind and urge the Council to agree to a derogation from the 90-head limit, subject to the proviso that such a derogation would be of benefit in terms of the environment and employment. I can also go along with the idea expressed in Amendment No 11, which suggests a temporary arrangement whereby the second payment of the special premium for steers may be granted in respect of steers for which the first payment of the special premium for bulls has been paid, subject to the proviso that the total premium payment in respect of such an animal must not exceed the normal aggregate payment of the special premium for steers.</p>
<p class="contents">I find myself unable to accept Amendments Nos 3, 13 and 17, however, the thrust of which is that premiums should be increased where stocking density is reduced. Such a measure would run counter to the aim of reducing production levels, because farmers would obtain just as much in premiums per hectare as they now receive.</p>
<p class="contents">The increases in premiums which Amendments Nos 14, 15 and 18 seek to achieve are already covered in practice by the current extensification premium. The proposal contained in Amendment No 14 that the premium for steers be increased in order to encourage this slower form of beef production appears interesting. Such a measure, however, would fundamentally upset the balance achieved by Agenda 2000. The same applies to Amendment No 27, which seeks to apply the stocking-density factor to the slaughter premium. For this reason, rather than incorporating these amendments into the present crisis-management package, I should prefer to look at them again in the framework of the mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of fixing a minimum percentage of heifers per herd of suckler cows is designed to ensure that premiums can also be obtained for keeping non-reproductive cows. This, if you like, is a sort of set-aside premium. In other words, it is a payment which is very definitely not production-linked. This payment only makes sense, however, if the minimum percentage exceeds the normal reproduction rate for cows. That is why I prefer to stick with my proposed minimum of 20% heifers. So I am afraid that I must reject Amendment No 16.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in Amendment No 19 that the minimum age for the calf-slaughter premium be abolished may well seem appealing to those who defended the early-slaughter premium in the past. I believe, however, that such a measure would be anathema to consumers who care about animal welfare. The proposal in Amendment No 21 for an increase in the slaughter premium for calves seems at first sight to be logical in view of the aims of increasing veal production and producing less red meat.</p>
<p class="contents">I doubt, however, whether such a measure would be effective, since the production of veal normally matches the consumption of veal, and I do not think we can expect veal consumption to rise in response to an increase in the premium. Another point is that this proposal would put considerable pressure on the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 28, which seeks to limit any increase in the slaughter premium for calves to animals fed with full-cream milk and reared on grassland, would, I believe, be impossible to implement in practice. Lastly, I welcome the proposal contained in Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8 and 22 that efforts be made to restore consumer confidence with the aid of an information campaign in order to increase the level of beef consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I believe it is important to introduce a suitable programme as quickly as possible. I do not believe, however, that the creation of a new legal basis after 1 January 2002 satisfies the need for rapid action. My staff have already been working very hard to develop such a programme on the basis of current legislation for implementation at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can judge from my reactions, this report and the exchange of views on the report have proved extremely fruitful. Even though I am unable to accept many of your amendments in their present form, the Commission is in complete substantive agreement with you on many points. Next week, I shall pass on these suggestions to the Council, which, I hope, will make a political decision on this package.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to answer the question put to me by Mr Alavanos, who asked me what I would say to my patron saint, Francis of Assisi, when I, God willing, reach the gates of heaven. Well, I shall say to him that, while it is certainly true that many animals have had to be slaughtered at this time of crisis, I have been committed to ensuring, within the Commission and with the help of the European Parliament, that the animals of this world continue to be treated with the greatest possible kindness.</p>
