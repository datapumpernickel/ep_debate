I would like to thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as Minister Michel said when he spoke before the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy on 28 August 2001, there has, in recent months, been an escalation of violence in the Middle East. The alarming result is the total collapse of trust between the two parties. On the ground, this has created a profound sense of helplessness amongst all the people concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, not a day goes by that is without bloody incidents and new acts of provocation, thereby indefinitely postponing a cease-fire, and an end to the infernal cycle of reprisals, all the while adding to the growing list of victims. This situation, recently described by Minister Hubert Védrine as ‘monstrous and revolting’, is naturally giving rise to grave concerns about stability in a region that is on our doorstep. The international community cannot tolerate such an escalation for much longer. It must strongly condemn the aggravating factors, namely the terrorism and the suicide attacks perpetrated by Palestinians in Israel. Apart from the fact that these acts of terrorism are an abomination in that they target innocent civilians, they simply encourage Israel to pursue an increasingly repressive policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Shooting at Israelis, whether Jewish settlers or soldiers, by Palestinians activists from Palestinian-controlled zones, and also the excessive and disproportionate use of force by Israel only fuels the cycle of violence. Using combat aircraft in residential areas, launching missiles to systematically destroy buildings housing police and security services of the Palestinian Authority, and assassinating Palestinian activists are hardly convincing components in a strategy geared towards achieving peace and security. Israeli military incursions into areas that have been transferred to Palestinian control are violations of signed agreements. The closure of Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem, especially Orient House, and the seizure of files are political measures that are not very likely to appease Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we consider the current prospects of resuming a direct dialogue, where would that leave us? To start with, it is against a very worrying backdrop of the radicalisation of positions by the different parties involved in the conflict that the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Shimon Peres, recently and publicly proposed resuming a direct dialogue with the Palestinian Authority in order to scale down the violence and to enforce a cease-fire, two objectives which have so far seemed out of reach. During his recent visit to the region, the German Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Joschka Fischer, managed to obtain an agreement from the Palestinian leader to set up a meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Peres.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hoped that this meeting, which will obviously require very careful preparation and preliminary meetings at intermediary levels, will succeed in overcoming the current security deadlock. It is, in fact, to help with these preparations that the EU Special Envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, visited the region at the end of August. Unfortunately, his mission had to be diverted very quickly from its original objective when fresh violence and tension erupted following Israel’s assassination of Mr Abdul Ali Mustafa, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front, on 27 August. This assassination led to extremely violent clashes in South Jerusalem, where the Jewish settlement of Gilo is located, as well as in the Beit Jalla and Bethlehem districts, located in the border region of the Palestinian West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Under extremely heavy international pressure and through intensive shuttle diplomacy by Mr Moratinos, his security advisor and the team of European monitors, combined with direct telephone contacts between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat, a local cease-fire was arranged, prompting the Israeli Army to withdraw from Beit Jalla at the break of day on 29 August.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in the context of the preparations for a meeting and talks between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat, the High Representative, Mr Solana, assisted by Ambassador Moratinos, made a renewed visit to the region, arriving in Jerusalem on Sunday, 2 September last. He will hold a series of meetings with the Palestinian and Israeli authorities on 3 and 4 September. He will therefore be in a position to give the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the Member States his impressions and assessment during the meeting in Genval, near Brussels, on 8 and 9 September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to efforts made by the European Union, I would like to stress that the Belgian Presidency set itself three objectives with a view to helping resolve the crisis in the Middle East. The first is to promote a policy of impartiality, which is absolutely necessary if the European Union wishes to gain Israel’s trust. The second is to enhance the role of the European Union in the region, in particular by making optimum use of the trust which the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, has earned since taking part in the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit and in the drafting of the Mitchell Commission report. The third is enhanced consultation between the European Union and the United States, given the key role that the Americans will be playing in resolving the Middle East issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us return for a moment to impartiality, whose principle and justifications are not always correctly understood. Some go so far as to claim that the European Union must henceforth align itself with the Palestinian and Arab positions. In my view, this is an aberration. First of all, we should remember that one of the difficulties is precisely due to the fact that Israel is opposed to any UN involvement in resolving this conflict, as it believes that the organisation would be biased against it, because the 22 countries of the Arab League and the 55 members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference would outnumber Israel and abuse its numerical strength. Attempts – and now it is a question of more than mere attempts – to compare Zionism with racism, as at the Durban Conference and, therefore, to transform the Israeli-Arab conflict into a racial and religious conflict, when in fact it is a political conflict requiring a political solution, will certainly not have helped matters. Fortunately, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has personally been able to win the respect and trust of Israel, with his much more measured approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, still on the subject of impartiality, how could the European Union justify its preference for one of the parties in the conflict, when it is involved in a partnership with both Israel and with the Palestinian authorities? The European Union is, in addition, working with Syria and Lebanon within the Barcelona process, one of the aims of which is precisely to establish an area of stability, peace and prosperity in the Euro-Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of impartiality is wholly in line with the Oslo accords. These accords rule out any action that could prejudice the outcome of the final negotiations in which the parties will negotiate directly with each other for the permanent settlement of the Palestinian question.</p>
<p class="contents">Having mentioned the aims of the Belgian Presidency, let us now consider progress in the recent efforts made by the European Union. The European Union backed the report of the ‘fact-finding commission’, widely referred to as the Mitchell Commission, whose recommendations were published in New York on 21 May 2001 and accepted by both parties. The European Union also lent its support for the Tenet cease-fire plan that came into force on 13 June 2001 with the agreement of both parties. We are aware of our progress with regard to observing this agreement. In spite of this, the plan aims to increase security cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian security services.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to fill the vacuum created by the absence of any direct dialogue, the European Union agreed upon a strategy of ensuring a presence in the region through an uninterrupted string of visits by prominent political leaders. In the run-up to the Belgian Presidency, Foreign Affairs Minister Louis Michel personally visited the six countries most directly concerned, during a six-day tour from 18 to 25 April 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, there has been a steady stream of foreign ministers, as well as the Prime Minister and Mr Solana, visiting the region. Most recently it was the turn of our German and Italian colleagues, and visits by the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister and Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, will soon take place. Despite having a very busy agenda, the Belgian Presidency hopes to be able to return to the region shortly, in early November, for example, if circumstances allow.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would have failed in my duty to acknowledge the efforts made by several institutions and key figures within the European Union if I also failed to highlight the extremely active role played by Commissioner Patten to ensure not only the financial survival of the Palestinian authorities but much more besides. Of course, he does much more than that. Clearly – and I cannot stress this enough – the European Union has hereto been the most important donor for the region and the Palestinian Authority and, without our financial assistance, without the imagination and ingeniousness that we have to use to continue to supply the authorities with adequate funding to enable it to function, the situation would be infinitely more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the General Affairs Council meeting of 16 July 2001, the European Union clearly set out what it expects of the parties involved. So as to ensure that peace returns to the region, the European Union said that it was particularly in favour of the principle of establishing an impartial monitoring mechanism, considering that such a mechanism would be in the interests of both parties. This proposal was included in the brief statement made by the Heads of State on 21 July 2001, at the end of the G8 Summit in Genoa, which I should mention at this point. The Fifteen are continuing to reflect on the means of implementing this mechanism. Lastly, the Presidency, on behalf of the Council, has of course issued statements whenever it was deemed to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to say in conclusion that this insane cycle of killings – and there is no other way to describe it – carried out by the continuing violence and terrorism is proving with each passing day to be totally ineffectual as a way of resolving the crisis. The serious deterioration in the security situation and the complete lack of trust between the two parties probably render unlikely any prospect of seeing the protagonists putting an end to their conflict by themselves. Outside help now appears essential.</p>
<p class="contents">With this background, an impartial monitoring mechanism, even on a small-scale, would be in the interests of both parties as a means of ensuring full implementation of the Tenet plan and the full and immediate application of the recommendations of the Mitchell Commission, respecting its deadlines and the planned order of events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> In the meantime, it is the responsibility of both parties to ensure that calm is restored. This means that they must each review their attitudes. On the one hand, the Palestinian Authority must adopt measures to stem the flow of violence and terrorism, without which any attempts to relaunch a political process would fail. For its part, Israel must create conditions that will favour a return to the negotiating table, mainly by lifting at the earliest opportunity all restrictions imposed on the Palestinian population. The so far very local cease-fire which the parties agreed upon on 28 August for the Beit Jalla/Bethlehem-Gilo sector and which is being complied with must be consolidated and extended to include other hotspots of conflict and tension in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of direct dialogue must allow the parties – provided that the situation on the ground becomes stable –to gradually make the transition from a crisis management scenario to a crisis resolution scenario. In my opinion, the immediate aims of this direct dialogue are the gradual extension and observation of the cease-fire. This should occur sector-by-sector as it were, together with the improvement of the living and working conditions of the Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Lastly, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the intensive and so-called final negotiations, which took place between July 2000 and January 2001, in locations ranging from Camp David to Taba, were not able to secure a framework agreement due to, on the one hand, mistakes made by all the parties involved and also because of artificially restrictive timetables, I still cannot stress enough the bold progress that was made in mapping out possible solutions to extremely delicate and highly complex issues of truly vital importance to both parties. It will, of course, be very hard to climb that mountain again, but priority must be given, firstly to restoring the trust lost by both parties, and also to the chances of achieving a satisfactory negotiated solution. That is why, instead of the current climate of pessimism that is now so deeply ingrained in public opinion shaken by the crisis, the leaders on both sides must quickly build new hope for a better future based on security, mutual respect and peace. Only a political process – one which finally results in the exchange of land for peace, puts an end to the occupation and allows the emergence of a sovereign, viable, democratic and peaceful Palestinian state that is committed to coexisting alongside Israel, and is therefore also willing, of course, to acknowledge this right to coexist with Israel – only this situation can finally give Israel and, more importantly, the region as a whole the security, stability and peace, to which their people aspire. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot resign ourselves to the logic of war and violence developing in both parties. The going will be tough, but we must get going.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, the Minister has set out with great clarity and comprehensiveness the situation in the Middle East at the moment and, as the Minister has said and everyone in Parliament knows, the situation in the region has gone from bad to worse and threatens to become worse still.</p>
<p class="contents">In considering what I should say this morning I was struck once again, by the difference between the strength of the adjectives and the nouns that we use to describe the situation and the strength of the verbs we use in trying to resolve it. It really is an intensely difficult problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The continuing violence – according to the news this morning there has been another suicide bombing in Jerusalem – and the endless recriminations and refusal of the parties to rise above their grievances and choose the path of peace is not only profoundly regrettable but also frustrating for everyone in the international community who is trying to find a way out of the current impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">Both parties, as the Minister said earlier, have failed to seize the opportunity offered by the recommendations of the Mitchell report, offered again in the Tenet plan. But again we come back to the point that there is no better basis for an end to the violence, for laying the foundations for a peaceful and prosperous future, than Mitchell. What is the alternative?</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative is more bloodshed, with an international dispute turned into a bitter feud and continuing collateral damage internationally, as we are seeing this week at the conference in Durban.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can the European Union do in these circumstances? The Minister has explained, very clearly the extremely important role the Presidency has been playing, trying to mobilise international opinion around proposals which offer a way forward. The Minister has also noted the efforts made by all the European Union foreign ministers and, of course, Javier Solana, who has been attempting to bring Israelis and Palestinians together and to get them to return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously have to continue to urge all concerned to implement all and not just some of the recommendations of the Mitchell report immediately. We will go on doing that and delivering that message. We must also urge the parties to reduce the level of distrust which has been built up in recent months. They must reaffirm their commitment to the fundamental long-term goals of the Middle East peace process, secure borders for Israel through the negotiated establishment of a viable Palestinian state on the basis of the relevant UN resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Palestinian leaders must make clear day-by-day their unequivocal condemnation of and opposition to attacks on the innocent and violence in all its forms. It is sometimes suggested by critics that we in the European Union have not been sufficiently strong in our condemnation of terrorism. That is a grossly unfair criticism. For example, in its statement after the attack in Jerusalem on 9 August the Presidency unreservedly condemned the bombing of a Jerusalem shopping centre and it abhorred that cowardly attack, which mainly claimed the lives of innocent civilians. After the attack in Haifa on 12 August, the Presidency once again put out a statement condemning recent suicide bomb attacks in the strongest terms and pointing out that these attacks targeted at Israeli citizens are hateful and repugnant in the extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have made clear our opposition to terrorism in all its manifestations, but if we are to stand a better chance of ending the cycle of violence and weakening the position of radical forces. Palestinians need to be able to see a real prospect of an improvement in their daily lives. This should include the implementation of existing agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. For a start, the lifting of the closures, the transfer of tax revenues, safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank, reopening of the airport and creating export facilities that will allow Palestinians to benefit from their agreements with the European Union and with other partners.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, for the life of me, understand why anybody should suppose that further impoverishment of the Palestinian territories and increased employment among young Palestinians can have anything to do with the restoration of security. I am sure that we all took away rewarding reading matter during our summer break. I spent a good deal of my summer reading about the 1930s and about the relationship between economic impoverishment, economic hardship and political extremism in country after country. We must go on reiterating the point that trying to do so much damage, putting such a tough squeeze on the Palestinian territories, is not to restore security or the way to lay the foundations for a future in which both parties can live happily and amicably together.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Third-party monitoring of the proper implementation of those agreements and a functioning dispute settlement mechanism would obviously help to address Palestinian frustration with the current non-implementation of existing agreements. All this would help to bring about a revival of the Palestinian economy, give Palestinians a stake in their own futures and improve the prospects for a better future to be achieved by political negotiations. These efforts need to be supported by a range of confidence-building measures to overcome the current deep distrust, not only between the leading politicians, but also between the two peoples. This is an area in which Parliament has quite rightly taken a particularly strong interest. I want to remind Parliament that in the past two years alone the Commission has allocated about EUR 50 million to peace-building programmes fostering Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in particular. These programmes promote peace through joint projects and awareness campaigns for tolerance and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an important role to play in supporting the voices of moderation wherever they exist. The sad fact is that the longer this dreadful situation continues the fewer moderates there are going to be, but they show considerable courage in their own communities and they deserve our continuing support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stands ready to use all the instruments available to it to help alleviate the very severe financial difficulties facing the Palestinians. Our package of support for the Palestinian authority is a successful example of how the European Union can deliver assistance in a sensible, fast and effective manner and I am extremely grateful to Parliament for its support in our work.</p>
<p class="contents">European support for the Palestinian Authority budget is secured until November and the Arab states are currently considering extending their budgetary support until the end of the year. It is still too early for any concrete announcement regarding further Commission intervention. We have just reached mid-term in our current support operation and we are awaiting Palestinian compliance with a number of conditions to be followed by an evaluation and assessment of the pretty grim macroeconomic and fiscal outlook.</p>
<p class="contents">Palestinian needs in 2002, and the contributions of other donors will have to be looked at in the context of an assessment of the economic situation in the Palestinian territories currently being carried out by the World Bank. It is expected that this exercise will be concluded by the end of September. Once these data are available, the Commission will consider how best we can contribute further to international efforts. Of course, we will keep in the closest touch with Parliament about our assessment of the financial requirements of the Palestinian authority and about our continuing determination to ensure that even in the present appalling circumstances our financial assistance depends, as far as the Palestinian side is concerned, on transparency, proper budgetary prudence and a commitment on the Palestinian side to fight corruption. Those are all points that have all been made to us by Members of this House and they underlie our determination to secure a proper agreement between ourselves and the Palestinians before we started releasing money in budgetary support.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I can only repeat what the Minister said so ably a few moments ago. What is required is a recommitment to Mitchell as rapidly as possible. Unless we see that, the situation will get even worse, with considerable damage right across the region.</p>

<p class="contents">We should all be wondering how we have been able to get into this situation, when, in January of this year, the then Labour Government of Israel put forward a peace proposal which today seems almost unimaginable. However, the Prime Minister, Mr Sharon, could also be asking himself whether the sense of insecurity which his compatriots are feeling today is greater or less than before he won the election comfortably. Yasser Arafat could also be asking himself whether his people are living better or worse than eleven months ago when the <span class="italic">Intifada</span> began.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we should be attributing blame here and I do not think we should be indulging in a simplistic reading of the events, but there is no doubt that the break-up of the negotiations has had a profound effect on Israeli and Palestinian public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In Israel this has meant that broad sections of the left in that country, above all those who were most involved in the negotiations at Sharm El Sheik, Camp David and Taba, are deeply disappointed in the Palestinian leader. This emotional reaction is combined with a more reflective reaction from some representatives of the right in Israel who agree on denying Mr Arafat the opportunity to negotiate. My group, Madam President, believes that this attitude is profoundly mistaken and that it in no way contributes to a recovery of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current circumstances it may be that Mr Arafat still has additional room for manoeuvre in terms of halting the violence, but he surely has less than the Israeli authorities are demanding of him. And, in any event, there is not the slightest sign on the horizon of any alternative possibility of negotiation on the Palestinian side. There is clearly nothing edifying about the situation of the Palestinian territories, whose citizens are living with a sense of humiliation and indignity, which is fertile ground for radical fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">But now more than ever the Palestinian Authority should demonstrate that it is prepared to comply with, and ensure compliance with, a peace agreement which in no way is going to fulfil all their aspirations. Despite the pessimism reigning on both sides, or perhaps because of it, the role of the international community is now essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union now has a broader margin for action, which it must exploit through specific contributions, using its economic influence in the area for political ends, ensuring that its development aid is applied to projects which bring specific benefits to the population and that, of course, it is coherent with the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and creating better and closer coordination with the negotiating forces of the US Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Madrid Conference, the European Union must recover the principle of ‘peace for land’, which inspired the peace talks. Like ten years ago, we Europeans now have to double our efforts, and my parliamentary group would therefore like to ask the Belgian Presidency to propose to the Council that we need to reinforce the team of our Special Representative, Mr Moratinos.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to express, on behalf of the Socialist Group, our condolences for today’s latest victims and begin by stating one fact: that we have returned in terms of rhetoric and actions to a situation which had begun to unravel after the Madrid Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to give a lengthy description of what is happening. I do believe that we Europeans should consider ourselves committed to and involved in this process. I prefer to talk about this than about equidistances, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, because there is no total equidistance between a consolidated, sovereign and democratic State such as Israel, and a possible embryonic State for a people which do not yet have a homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that that is an important element to which we should add – as a message to Mr Sharon’s government – that the policy of ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’ brings nothing but disaster. We Europeans know something about this, because it is precisely that policy which we have abandoned by means of the European Union. Furthermore, economic and human asphyxia is not the way to resolve the conflict and a policy of this type only serves to reinforce the extremists on both sides. I therefore believe that, from the position of friendship that we feel for Israel, we must express this clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Madam President, for the first time we Europeans are signatories of an agreement. We were at Sharm el-Sheik and the High Representative is currently in Jerusalem. Our Foreign Affairs Ministers, Mr Fischer, Mr Michel and Mr Ruggiero, are visiting the area and I believe that this also demonstrates our European will. I believe that we do not just have to express political will, but that Parliament has to help to find the light at the end of this tunnel. That is why I proposed to the Conference of Presidents – and it has been accepted – that, instead of producing a resolution today, in the heat of the moment, without knowing the result of the consultations, we use the weapon granted us by the Treaty of Maastricht and produce a recommendation so that the Committee on Foreign Affairs can assess whether or not there is any progress throughout this month.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in this game of lethal symbols which the Israel and the Palestinians are engaged in, we should also ask for positive symbols. One of them, which seems to me important, is that Orient House in Jerusalem be reopened, because it has always been a platform for peace. I must remind you that, as President of the European Parliament, I had the opportunity to visit Orient House. Nothing will be achieved by removing all the bridges to dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Madam President, in the middle of this dramatic crisis, it is cause for hope that there are Israeli and Palestinian voices which have the civic and political courage to sign a joint manifesto. I am referring to the appeal made jointly by some of the protagonists of the peace processes of recent years, for example Mr Beilin and Mrs Ashraui, who have signed a manifesto – I have the original text in English – in which, under the title "No to bloodshed, no to occupation, yes to negotiation, yes to peace" they say something which the directorate of the Party of European Socialists decided to jointly support at its meeting on Sunday.</p>
<p class="contents">I will quote a section of this manifesto which, in my opinion, sums up the will which we have to apply to this process. It says the following: "We still believe in the humanity of the other side, that we have a partner for peace and that a negotiated solution to the conflict between our peoples is possible".</p>
<p class="contents">That is the approach which we Europeans have to support. We must ask the Americans to be more active and to try once again to guide the people of the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to insist on what Commissioner Patten has said: the violence has not perhaps reached the level it could reach. Sometimes we say ‘things cannot get any worse’, but in this case the situation could get worse. Therefore, our obligation is not only to resolve the problem but, of course, to prevent it getting any worse.</p>
<p class="contents">However, apart from the fact that we are trying to put an end to the violence by means of dialogue, I believe that I should add certain aspects, directly related to human rights, to what previous speakers have said. Of course, the fact that there are innocent victims represents a direct attack on human rights. It is therefore necessary to point out specifically and to insist, both to Israel, which frequently uses disproportionate State force, and to the Palestinians, who do not control their activists, that human rights are continually being affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Parliament should currently be sensitive to the fact, condemned by certain NGOs, that four Palestinians may be executed if Yasser Arafat does not commute the sentences handed down for internal activities within the Palestinian area or for collaboration. I believe that this Parliament should try to prevent these executions.</p>
<p class="contents">Recovering dialogue: I would like, in the time available to me, because everything is getting worse and, of course, the Durban Conference has merely exacerbated the situation, to mention what I believe are the eight issues to which we should lend clear support.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe that the priority should be to resolve the problem of impartiality. I agree that impartiality is not the same as equidistance, Mr Barón, I agree with you. I believe that impartiality is a necessary concept, but in politics impartiality is often not achieved without equidistance. Therefore, equidistance may be an instrument, although I do not doubt that the objective is impartiality. I believe that it is urgent and important to recover impartiality towards everybody, in particular towards Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must clearly insist on the mission of impartial observers from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Mitchell report must continue to be the direction we take. There is no other, at the moment at least.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must prevent the inappropriate use of the Barcelona Process for the Middle East conflict. The Barcelona Process suffers with the Middle East Conflict but it is not the appropriate course for resolving that conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we must insist on the need for the United States and Russia to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth issue is that we must clearly promote as far as possible every type of contact, as is happening at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The seventh issue is that the actions of the Ministers, of the Commission and of the Council must be aimed at promoting dialogue between Mr Arafat and Mr Peres, between Palestinians and Israelis. And in this regard, Madam President, we keenly await the report to be presented by Mr Solana and which Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has announced.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and here I agree with Mr Barón Crespo, any symbol is positive; any possibility, such as the opening of Orient House, is positive; anything which will stop the conflict escalating is important and the essential thing is to return to peace and dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Debates in which everyone acknowledges the seriousness of the situation and subsequently repeats what they said last time. The debate on the Middle East threatens to become something of a ritual debate. We too, in Parliament, are always asking for the European Union to play a more active role. The Council and the Commission subsequently respond: we are making every effort, but we cannot do anything alone and there is division in the ranks. This position was expressed most clearly by Mr Michel last week.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to us, including myself, that diplomatic success is impossible without the United States. But what is the United States doing? In this connection, I would concur with Mr van den Broek, the predecessor of Mr Patten as Commissioner for External Relations, who said that the United States is, in fact, pursuing a declaratory policy. It says that things should be done differently. It calls on the parties to stop what they are doing, and then nothing happens. If the European Union wishes to adopt the same policy, that should be made clear, and we should then no longer talk about the European Union’s playing an active role in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, I should like to make a fresh attempt to break the deadlock, in this case the ritual debate, by invoking the European Union’s economic role. If the truth be told, I am getting a little tired of the response by the Commission and Council who say: Mr Lagendijk, economic sanctions are ineffective. As Mr Michel said last week: we know where we start but we do not know where we finish. What I want, the appeal that I am making, is not for economic sanctions à la Iraq. That is not what I want at all. What is important is that it is unacceptable for the European Union to carry on as we have always done while the region is under threat of war. We are doing business with the Israelis and are simply the Palestinians’ largest donor. We cannot continue as if nothing were wrong, while the region is on the brink of war.</p>
<p class="contents">I only want to know, and I am addressing this question to the Commission and the Council, whether you would be so kind as to examine the options – and I am choosing my words carefully – for trying, via the economic ties we have with both parties, and I emphasise ‘both’ parties, to apply pressure in order to bring the parties back to the negotiating table. I was, from that point of view, pleasantly surprised that Mr Van den Broek, Mr Patten’s predecessor, thinks along the same lines. I appreciate that this is difficult. It might even be impossible. However, it would be unacceptable if the use of financial instruments by the European Union were ruled out. The Council and the Commission have repeatedly stated that they are willing to make every effort to break the deadlock. In my opinion, this includes that instrument too. Even if it is painful, I do hope that the European Union does not make the same mistake as the United States, namely say that something must be done and subsequently do nothing.</p>

<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in this context, it does not make much sense to talk of a policy of impartiality. We are not taking sides against Israel by condemning outright the policy of its current government. This was a policy that the statesman Yitzhak Rabin had the insight and courage to turn his back on, an action which cost him his life.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, now that all prospects of a just peace for the Palestinian people have been dashed, bloody attacks are being made on innocent Israeli civilians, which exceed the boundaries of legitimate resistance by an occupied people. These intolerable actions only serve to increase the hatred and feelings of vengeance.</p>
<p class="contents">A vicious circle was precisely what we feared most in the event of Ariel Sharon’s election, and this is what we are now caught up in.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the comments made by Commissioner Patten. We must concentrate on doing all we possibly can to help to find a way out of this impasse that is causing so many deaths. In this spirit, and I repeat what Mr Barón Crespo has said, we can only welcome with great pleasure and profound admiration the eminently dignified and courageous work that a group of key figures, both Israeli and Palestinians, ministers, members of parliament, writers and lawyers, carried out this summer. The outcome of this collaboration was the publication of a joint declaration in which they made a commitment to work together, on the basis of principles that are acknowledged by the international community, to restore trust and hope in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In conjunction with the laudable efforts of our diplomatic staff, I propose that we lend our support to this initiative by using all the resources at our disposal, by inviting, for example, the two main players – the former Israeli minister, Yossi Beilin, and the Palestinian minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo – or by awarding them the Sakharov Prize, or even by setting up a European committee to support their joint declaration. In doing so, we shall, in our capacity as the European Parliament, be making a real contribution to peace. Thank you in advance.</p>

We are all aware that the levels of violence have dangerously escalated and that the excessive and disproportionate use of force has resulted in the deaths of many innocent civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that commitments entered into by various parties, instead of being built upon, are in fact being reversed. The levels of violence and the levels of provocation have risen to new heights, and this is the primary reason why the parties are now no longer engaged in dialogue. Dialogue is the only way forward if we are to end the violence in the Middle East at this time. Where dialogue does not take place, the gap is only filled by mutual misunderstandings and ritual condemnations and fear.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the primary challenges now for the European Union and the broader international community is to ensure that there is a resumption of an active and effective mediation process within the Middle East. There is an urgent need for a third-party monitoring system to be appointed in an effort firstly to end the violence which is taking place now on a daily basis, and secondly to resume peace talks. It is also time that the obstacles to the implementation of the Mitchell report were removed. We should recall for a moment that the key findings of this fact-finding committee include the following recommendations: the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority should reaffirm existing agreements and immediately cease violence; there should be a resumption of security cooperation; there should be establishment of a meaningful cooling-off period and incitement in all forms should be discouraged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps he was thinking of Mr Riad Al-Turk, the leading opposition figure in Syria, who was re-arrested today. Perhaps he was thinking of the shocking images showing how 50 homosexual men were recently treated in Egypt. Perhaps he was thinking of the trial of Nawal El Sadaawi, or perhaps of the trial of Mr Ibrahimi, also in Egypt. Perhaps he was thinking of all the women in Saudi Arabia and other countries, who have absolutely no rights in their own countries. This describes the Middle East of today, the Middle East that we do not discuss. This is the Middle East that we encourage to reject democracy, to reject the rule of law, and we continue to consider and propose a policy of impartiality for Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Neyts<span class="bold">-</span>Uyttebroeck, I think that it is impossible in politics – and even less so in this particular case – to propose a policy of impartiality. The European Union’s policy must, of course, be a policy to promote peace, but, most importantly and primarily, it must be a policy to promote democracy. Yet, we still have a great deal to do in order to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">We all knew, and now we know exactly how far Mr Barak stretched his profound determination to reach a fair peace agreement with the Palestinians, and we know that it was the determination of Mr Arafat and his democratic supporters alone that sabotaged and destroyed this peace process. It is clear that some Members of this House would like Mr Sharon to conduct a different policy. Unfortunately, Mr Sharon’s policy is not very different. Of course, he has made some mistakes, but in the main, he is acting in response to the deep-rooted feelings of the Israelis, who no longer trust Mr Arafat – I do not mean the Palestinian people – and I think we can understand why this is the case. I think that this is the fundamental problem and the European Union cannot respond, Mr Patten, by considering sociological proposals to improve the economic conditions. This is a political question and it concerns the involvement of the European Union in this process. The Union has an historical duty to be involved. Instead of continuing to advance reluctantly with regard to enlargement, the European Union has no choice but to propose that Israel, with its population of five million people, becomes a full member of the European Union. This is the only way to ensure the security of the Israeli people and also, therefore, the security of the Palestinians and thus to guarantee peace for the future. Any other suggestion is just hot air. As Mr Lagendijk pointed out, we have said a great deal. Perhaps we should now get down to the business of politics.</p>

This is mainly due to two factors, as Mr Michel openly acknowledged: Israel considers the EU to be pro-Palestinian, in other words not to be an impartial external mediator in the dispute between neighbours; and, secondly, there is no unanimity within the European Council as to a common strategy to be adopted for the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the EU respond? It can, at any rate, moderate the Israeli criticism of pro-Palestinian partiality by resolutely distancing itself as the Council, the Commission and individual Member States from the unprecedented anti-Israeli smear campaign which is currently being conducted at and around the UN Conference against racism in Durban. At the same time, the European institutions must openly condemn the behaviour of the President of the Palestinian Authority. Mr Arafat’s accusation, levelled at Israel, of pursuing a racist policy only fans the flames of Palestinian violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the German Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, is attempting to round up the EU Member States in order to revive the Middle East peace process. His plans, summarised in a non-paper, have the backing of four major EU Member States (France, Great Britain, Spain and Italy), as well as of the High Representative, Mr Solana, according to the German press. Have the other members of the Council or the Commission been consulted? I would also add another question to this: has an understanding been reached with the US Administration? Surely, both the President of the Council, Mr Michel, and the non-paper emphasise the indispensability of Washington in order for the peace process to get back on its feet.</p>
<p class="contents">The essence of the non-paper is the mediation and arrangement of an initial meeting between the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Peres, and Mr Arafat. This meeting should be the cautious beginning of a gradual peace process. Certainly in the non-paper, the Palestinians demand an end to the violence, but that is no longer an absolute condition for Israeli-Palestinian talks. Does the European Union not in this way, in fact, brook the Palestinian <span class="italic">Intifada</span>, which has now grown into a fully-fledged guerrilla organisation with fully-equipped paramilitary units? If the Council and the Commission are to avoid this elementary question, then all well-intended mediation attempts will irrevocably fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

German Foreign Minister Fischer has perhaps shown us what European mediation could be like, by contrast to the embarrassing comparisons made by the Finnish Foreign Minister between the crimes of the national socialists and Israel and the aggressive attacks against Israel made by the Belgian Foreign Minister. I was also shocked to see shops in Brussels with signs saying “We do not stock Israeli products”. Perhaps some day European politicians will understand that no one is interested in their personal interpretations of the conflict. Our task is to help to calm the conflict, and this will only be possible if we recognise the Palestinian people’s need for independence and freedom, while also recognising Israel’s need for security and above all, too, recognising Israel as a democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This violence has cost the lives of more than 150 Palestinian children and adolescents and dozens of Israeli children.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the statements we have heard this morning from the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and from the Commission, it is clear that the European Union is not remaining, must not remain, impassive in the face of this situation and that the objective of sitting down at the negotiating table – although many of us are longing for another Madrid Conference – seems practically utopian compared to the objective of an immediate halt to the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if the next meeting between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat will lead to that halt to the violence – time will tell – but what does seem clear is that, in order for violence to end, I believe two conditions are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the will of the two sides. It is clear that this ‘dialogue’ of suicide bombings and bombings by F15s and F16s must end. The moderates must speak up, as Mr Patten rightly said. I believe that this is the time for the moderates and, in this regard, the European Union must support all the options.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the international community must act: the United States, Russia – where the Israeli Prime Minister is today – and the European Union, which must hold all the cards so that it can play its rightful role on the basis of two undeniable premises. One was mentioned by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council: international law is being permanently violated and it must be reestablished. And, secondly, the European Union must have a single commitment and that commitment is the cause of peace. But two things must be taken into account: that peace must be the fruit of justice, Madam President, and that moderation becomes a vice when it rejects a commitment to a just cause such as the cause of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the Sharon government has been dramatically changing the personal and collective daily lives of the Palestinians for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sharon government is mistaken in assuming philosophies such as that expressed by Minister Landau, because the Palestinians are not looking for the Israeli Government to grant political concessions. Nobody can grant what is not theirs. The Palestinians simply want the rule of law to prevail and the principles of international law to be respected and put into practice as they have been proclaiming for decades, though so far fruitlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian demands are clear and easily shared by citizens of good will. They are simply asking for an end to the military occupation they are subjected to. It must be remembered that they are not fighting the Israeli occupiers because they are Jews, but because they are occupiers. They demand the evacuation of the Jewish settlements, established on their territory with the clear objective of making a viable Palestinian State impossible. Finally, they aspire to the proclamation of a true and genuine independent State.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, before it is too late, the European Union is morally obliged to find a system which will lead the occupier to respect international law. It is that simple. I also believe that the forces of reason and of political intelligence in Israel should mobilise themselves in order to convince their co-citizens that the longer the occupation and repression lasts, the more radical the Palestinians will be.</p>

Has the Council forgotten that we are dealing here with a militarily and economically superior occupying power which, in contravention of international law, is oppressing a native population and stealing its land? Moreover, the occupying power has the full support of the United States. Why, then, must the EU treat Israel and Palestine equally? Did we treat Milosevic and the Kosovans equally? Did we treat Mandela and the apartheid regime equally? In occupied Belgium, did you treat your resistance fighters in the same way as the occupying forces? No, equal treatment would naturally have been absurd in every one of those cases. In a report, our own conflict prevention network has recommended that we put economic pressure on Israel. One is led to wonder, Mr Patten, whether you decided to close down the CPN because it comes up with uncomfortable truths.</p>
<p class="contents">According to yesterday’s <span class="italic">Süddeutsche Zeitung</span>, the EU – or, properly speaking, the big five Member States of the EU (we other, small countries are not asked) – is now, according to a non-paper, to pursue a Middle East policy approved by the United States. It is therefore a requirement that it be approved by the United States. What has become of the EU’s role as a defender of international law? What has become of the EU’s ambitions for an independent foreign policy? What has become of its ambitions to supplement its excellent economic and administrative support for the Palestinians with a powerful and well thought-out policy? They seem to have evaporated into thin air. That is something I regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have had enough of words which are not matched by action and I am starting to doubt the power and effectiveness of Parliament and our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, I feel like the little girl in the story “The Emperor’s New Clothes”. We all know exactly what is going on. Mr Sharon speaks and acts clearly, and he says when he speaks in parliament that his intention is to bomb and kill, targeting, in particular, the Palestinian leaders, and to raise houses to the ground, not just in order to destroy the houses but as part of a clear plan. When I was in Palestine and Israel between 23 July and 22 August, I saw houses raised to the ground in the settlement areas to gain more territory for Israel; I witnessed the taking of <span class="italic">Orient House</span> and saw the Israeli flag hoisted immediately – a totally colonialist gesture. Therefore, Mr Sharon is going ahead with his plan, which is to restore only 42% of the territories to the Palestinians, who are forced to live in <span class="italic">bantustans</span>, without a State or borders. He is making himself plain. Why do we not believe the things that Mr Sharon is saying explicitly? Why are occupiers and occupied placed on the same level?</p>
<p class="contents">Like the President-in-Office of the Council, I am appalled and horrified by this situation, but I am also, on occasion, appalled and outraged at the way we describe the facts; of course, I condemn the throwing of bombs at civilians in Tel Aviv as an appalling, criminal act, but I feel that it must be said that the root of the matter is the need to put an end to the Israeli military occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have met Mr Arafat several times – the last time together with French and American delegations – and he said to us: “We are not asking for much. We are asking for international law to be respected. This is our request and I have accepted everything: the G8, Sharm-el-Sheik and Mitchell.” The Mitchell plan was not rejected by Mr Arafat. It was rejected by Mr Sharon because the Mitchell plan stipulated the end of the settlements and new settlements are still being established today. Behind the fighting and violence, there is, in actual fact, a plan being executed: more destruction of houses and more settlements. This is a fundamental barrier to the possibility of peace. Together with Mr Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Yaser Abed Rabbo, Mr Yossi Beilin and Mrs Galia Golan, I signed the document presented at Ramallah: they demand peace, a fair peace. Just as those courageous Israelis who are defending the rights of all and who, together with me and many others, have been sleeping in the Palestinian houses bombed at Beit Jala demand it.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, Europe must act. I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for the things he has said and I support Mr Galeote Quecedo’s proposal to reinforce our political presence in the field. I consider it absolutely essential for international observers to be sent but, once again, it is Israel who has refused to cooperate. Why do we not say so openly? Why do we not make the situation plain? Dialogue is essential for peace but respect for the law and for human rights are just as essential and cannot be treated as separate issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If Europe does not take a firm stand against the statements made at Durban equating Zionism to racism, it will be dealing another mortal blow to the survival of the West as a culture which embodies the right of nations and peoples and it will fall back into the abyss which engulfed us at the time of the Nazi concentration camps and communist persecutions.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />When, after the attack outside the disco in Israel – just hours after Mr Arafat’s visit to the European Parliament in Brussels – and the attack at the pizzeria, Europe spoke out, there began to be hope that dialogue would be resumed, but Europe has subsided into silence. Terrorist attacks on civilian targets in Israel have become everyday occurrences, forcing the Israeli army to defend the civilian population. Moreover, Israeli civilians have also failed to show respect for the human dignity of the Palestinians on a number of occasions and violence has become a symbol of and synonymous with a tragic period of history, one, indeed, in which Europe is incapable of speaking out and, what is more, fails to remember that, in actual fact, the Palestinian leader has never commanded his forces to stop the violence but, on the contrary, has released Hamas and Jihad terrorists from jail.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise that terrorism is becoming an international phenomenon and that greater political commitment is needed to oppose this unwelcome development. Europe provides a considerable amount of economic aid to the Palestinian Authority: we would like to see proof that the Union’s funds are being used to help the people to work towards the success of the peace process as well and not to provide weapons for terrorists. In the light of recent events, we request a detailed report on this point and we call upon Europe to play a useful part and to demand from both Israel and Mr Arafat a genuine peace process, not just the words or terrorist bombs of recent years and months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this situation there is absolutely no point in formulating resolutions. After all, that was our experience in Europe, too, when in 1950 we united coal and steel to put an end to a thousand years of warfare between the Germans and the French. In the Middle East today, the equivalent of coal and steel is tourism, water and energy. We must change our policy here and support cooperative projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1993, we have given massive support – billions of euros – to the Palestinian Authority because we wanted the Oslo peace process to be a success. But if you talk to the peace movement in Israel today, you find that members of parliament who only a few years ago went to prison because they talked to Mr Arafat are now saying they would not talk to him any more. He is not stopping the violence, he is behind all this violence that we again witnessed last night. Such a situation inevitably brought Mr Sharon to power. That is why we need a new starting point for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, Commissioner, I would like to disagree slightly with your conclusion that these allocations of EUR 10 million to the Palestinian budget between now and November are a good thing. Lump sum payments of that kind can be made to stabilise a budget, but now we need funds with strings attached, not lump sum payments on such a scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must not continue to make unconditional payments to multilateral bodies like the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency, UNWRA. I would like to read to you something from a schoolbook used by the UNWRA in Palestinian refugee camps. It says: “The extermination of the Jews was a just and unavoidable evil.” The book praises Adolf Hitler and describes the corrosive power of the Jews in the 1930s. If that kind of thing is being taught to eight and nine year old children, if suicide attacks are praised, if martyrdom is glorified, then the European Union with the values it stands for must say: we will not pay for that under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you to look very carefully at what is being taught in Palestinian schools and in the refugee camps through the UNWRA. Our money should not be used to promote such anti-Semitism and statements of that kind.</p>

<p class="contents">On several occasions, suicide bombers, armed by Hamas and encouraged by the Palestinian Authority, caused bloodshed in the heart of Israel, and each time, the European Union did nothing more than issue verbal condemnations, whilst all the time continuing to give generous funding to the Palestinian Authority, which has recently freed the most dangerous terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we hope to fulfil a credible role when we continue to provide considerable sums of money, unmonitored, to an authority which is an authority in name only, and which remains one of the world’s most corrupt political entities?</p>
<p class="contents">A recent report by the Court of Auditors revealed that there has been serious mismanagement and many cases of misappropriation under Yasser Arafat. Were sanctions imposed? Did you demand transparency, Commissioner? On the contrary, the complacent attitude and leniency shown by the Commission could only be taken as incentives to continue along this disastrous route.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, peace was a possibility at Camp David, peace was within reach. What did Mr Arafat do? Once again, he lacked the bravery of President Anwar al-Sadat and dashed all our hopes. He said no to peace at Camp David. One month later, the <span class="italic">Intifada</span> was resumed. This time, however, there were elements of a genuine anti-Semitic crusade and the most dangerous terrorists were at large.</p>
<p class="contents">Did the Commission and the Council take specific action in response to a further breach of the Oslo accords? Did they even subject their funding to any conditions? The answer again is no, and I confirm that generations of young Palestinians continue to receive education instilling martyrdom and hatred, which is funded by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we fail to see that the <span class="italic">Intifada</span> is revealing its true nature, which is fanatical, mystical and insane and which completely rejects the existence of Israel. We can, of course, criticise Israel but how can we fail to see that the rejection of Israel, when systematic, unbalanced and unjust or even when it involves sending away both parties without favouring either, may serve to disguise the anti-Semitism which still exists?</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the historian Léon Poliakov quite rightly said that anti-Semitism is to refuse a human being the right to exist because he is Jewish and anti-Zionism is to refuse a State the right to exist because it is Jewish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had conversations with Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat and other very senior people there.</p>
<p class="contents">It was made clear to us that the Mitchell proposals are still accepted by both sides. The problem is how to put them into effect. This cannot begin until there is a cessation of terrorism and only yesterday there was another suicide bomb attack in Jerusalem. The Europeans should cease worrying about having a role. They have one. The question is whether they will exercise it in a balanced and useful way. The United States and the Europeans must work in harmony and not allow themselves to be played off one against the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past the European Union has been seen merely as a supporter of the Palestinians. It was an institution looking for a role. Now Mr Solana is winning the confidence of the Israelis as well by a more balanced and realistic approach without being too prescriptive. I am reassured by the Presidency remarks this morning on the need for equi-distance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Palestinian side, the danger is that intransigence will be fuelled by events such as the UN racism conference in South Africa, through the influence of radical Arab forces in the region and by the breakdown of liaison between Israeli and Palestinian security agencies. Instead of suppressing Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other extremist elements, the Palestinian agencies are now too often in bed with the extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully accept Mr Patten's analysis that further impoverishment of the Palestinians will not discourage extremism but I have no doubt that the European Union should use its financial leverage with the Palestinians to greater political effect. We must make it clear that continued funding requires the Palestinians to bear down with greater effect and greater consistency on the extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take care also over this question of international monitors. The precedents are not good. The most likely form of increased international presence on the ground is a resuscitation of the liaison between the Israeli and Palestinian security services reinforced by American and European elements. This might not catch the headlines but through removal of misunderstanding and more effective action against extremists, it may actually help create some of the conditions for peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You actually described what the Israeli government is doing, namely murdering its opponents, whom it accuses of being terrorists, as murder. In the light of this fact I find it embarrassing and sometimes in poor taste to make reference to schoolbooks when we see that Orient House is occupied, Palestinian territory is invaded and occupied and Palestinian police stations are systematically destroyed regardless of the human casualties. Anyone who says Mr Arafat is responsible for what is going on there cannot be very well informed about politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything we have tried and proposed in the past has failed, sending observers – I am glad Mr Van Orden also advocates that – all that has failed because of the Israeli government’s refusal to accept it. Even the Mitchell report, which we all support as a common point of reference, cannot be implemented because the Israeli government under Mr Sharon – who is wanted by the police in your country, Madam President-in-Office, which is why he cannot be invited to Brussels – wants to interpret the Mitchell report and determine when it will be applied. In view of this situation, I am no longer calling for greater involvement in the process. We want to be involved, but we are not accepted. What else can we do? We have a treaty with Israel and we ought to give some thought – you have also mentioned this in the past, Commissioner, where treaties have been broken – to whether we can maintain that treaty in force or whether we ought to suspend it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately these hopes were to be cruelly shattered and it is hard to forget that the present <span class="italic">Intifada</span> arose directly from the unnecessary and provocative visit by Mr Sharon to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. However, nothing justified the subsequent acts of terrorism by either side, and in the current highly charged emotional situation, with the areas of conflict so widespread, it is very difficult to see a cease-fire emerging.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the only way of breaking the current deadlock is through the intervention of a third party. The only feasible third party would be a team of international observers. We know this is acceptable to the United Nations and the Palestinians, but regrettably it has been rejected by the Israelis. The United States has endorsed the Israeli position. Regrettably its blind allegiance is paradoxically damaging to Israel's cause. Instead of being a puppet of the Israelis, the US should be independent and use its influence to pressurise them to end their violence, just as we, in the EU, must use our influence with the Palestinians to do likewise. If both we and the US work together in common cause, there is just a possibility that we could halt the continuing slide into regional conflict and restore peace negotiations once again on the basis of the Mitchell recommendations. That should continue to be our primary objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I understand only too well how tempting it is, when faced with the seemingly endless cycle of acts of violence and violent retaliation, to give in firstly to our emotions, whether positive or negative. This is a very human response and if we did not react in such a way, we might wonder, in fact, whether we are human. I believe, however, that if we want to help find a solution, we must control these emotions and overcome them. We must also be able to control our frustration – and God only knows how frustrated we are by this process, where we take one step forward and two steps back, and sometimes even two steps forward and three steps back. We must always begin again, pick up the pieces, maintain contact with both parties and use the carrot and stick approach – if you will forgive me using such a crude expression – as circumstances require. This is a process to which, I believe, all the bodies of the European Union, including the Presidency, of course, are devoted, in the full knowledge that by continuously working hard to try to safeguard opportunities for a solution, there is a great danger that neither side will be satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to endorse the comments of those Members who have reiterated that the European Union’s role in a region of the world so close to our own is today much more important than it was several years ago. However, very many of you have also said that a solution cannot be found without much more active and dynamic support than is currently being given by the US administration and other bodies or other governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and to sum up, Madam President, I would nevertheless like to say to those who have criticised the concept of impartiality, as they may rightfully do so, of course, that by maintaining a position of equal distance between both parties does not mean we believe that their circumstances are identical. To use the English expression, and these will be my closing words, <span class="italic">‘equidistance is not equalising the parties involved.’</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has been an interesting debate, focusing on some familiar and central themes. There have been some disagreements, but by and large it is fair to say that most Members take the same view of the situation and there has been perhaps a shared sense of frustration about how we can best contribute to resolving this appalling and deteriorating situation. Obviously we are going to come back to the subject again and again in the coming weeks and we will be able to respond to some of the very positive suggestions made in this debate. For example the suggestion made by Mr Galeote about the resources available to Ambassador Moratinos, who has been doing such an outstanding job.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the speeches made Mr Zimeray and Mr Laschet and I will do so with all the diplomatic restraint for which I am famed, not least in Asia.

I am bound to say that I have not heard many speeches less well informed than Mr Zimeray's. I would wish that Mr Laschet's speech had been a little better informed as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I know of no serious commentator on the Middle East who argues that we would all be better served if the Palestinian authority was brought to its knees. Most Members of this Parliament are aware of the Commission's efforts to make sure that the European support for the Palestinian authority is money that is properly spent, well spent and spent in ways that help to promote pluralism, the rule of law and clean government in the Palestinian territories. I am surprised that the honourable gentleman did not know that, before we make each month's payment, we have to have the seal of approval of the International Monetary Fund to ensure that the money voted by this Parliament is being spent in a sensible way.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all issues we have discussed at great length with Parliament, which has been rightly concerned to ensure that European taxpayers' money is spent properly, transparently and to good purpose. I would be delighted to come back to this subject again in the future, but I want to underline that point today because I do not think it is helpful when Members of this House give the impression we are not spending European taxpayers' money sensibly.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to deal with a subject which I have dealt with again and again. Perhaps if I talk about it once more today, I will be able to save one or two honourable Members who have not yet got the point from raising it in correspondence and in speeches in Parliament in the future. It is repeatedly suggested, not least in some sections of the Israeli press, that the European Union has been implicated in funding Palestinian schoolbooks which contain anti-Semitic passages.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to be very clear on this. None of the projects in support of the Palestinian authority, none of the projects in support of UNRWA financed by the European Commission, include the production or distribution of school textbooks. It is true that this year, for example, we have contributed EUR 35 million to the UNRWA's EUR 170 million education budget. I would just like to point out that we are not the largest contributor to that budget. The largest contributor is the United States and I do not think anybody is suggesting that by contributing to the education budget of UNRWA the United States is guilty of the things with which we are charged in the Commission. Assistance to the educational system is focused on infrastructure, equipment and direct assistance for current school expenses, such as salaries for teachers. It would hardly help to contribute to security in the Palestinian territories if teachers were being laid off in large numbers because nobody could afford to pay them.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, no request has ever been made to us by the Palestinian authority to finance curricula or textbooks. We reject any attempt to use the educational system as a vehicle to promote intolerance and to hinder the efforts by the parties still committed to peace in the Middle East. It is particularly regrettable in this context that school children may be exposed to intolerance by the parties involved in the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always and will always continue to focus its assistance on promoting a culture of peace, tolerance and human rights in the Middle East. Recent studies of Palestinian books have shown that anti-Semitic language contained in old Egyptian and Jordanian textbooks used by the Palestine authority and UNWRA, particularly before 1994 and 1995, is being removed. These new books, rightly or wrongly, have been criticised for not conveying a clear message of peace and friendship with the Israeli people. I wish they did convey such a message. However, textbooks are not going to change the tragic reality of daily life in the Palestinian territories or in the Palestinian camps.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that UNWRA is running a substantial tolerance and awareness programme in its schools to counteract any negative influence on the pupils, but it cannot be very easy for a teacher in the camps to be teaching children about tolerance and awareness when they go out of the camp in the evening and see tanks and guns and stone throwing. Teaching a tolerance and awareness programme in those camps must be one of the most difficult jobs in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I beg honourable Members who take up rather partisan positions on these matters to think of those who are working day after day in the camps and elsewhere in the Middle East to promote decency, to promote the sort of values which we share in this chamber. I do not think that rather cheap attacks on what is being done by UNWRA and by others are the sort of thing that one should hear in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say something about Mr Lagendijk's speech, because I normally agree with the honourable gentleman. He makes some of the most thoughtful and interesting and well-informed contributions to our debates. Of course, we all have the ambition to take steps on behalf of the European Union that would make a bad situation in the Middle East better.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, possible for us to contemplate or take steps that would make a bad situation worse. The honourable Member talks about economic measures. It is true that we have a very important economic relationship with both Israel and with the Palestinian Authority and with the other states in the region. I am not unaware of the consequences of that relationship in political terms. We are trying to ensure, as I have said before, that the assistance that we provide for the Palestinian Authority promotes pluralism, promotes clean government, promotes an independent judiciary, promotes the rule of law and promotes democracy. That is what we should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also insisting with the Israeli authorities that our agreements with them are honoured to the letter as well as to the spirit – that is what we said to them during our discussions at the customs cooperation meeting in July. But I have the gravest doubts about going beyond that. The record of economic sanctions in international affairs is not – alas – a very happy one. I have great respect for the honourable Member's views and I am sure that we can exchange further thoughts about this issue, but I would need a great deal of persuasion that we should start talking the language of sanctions in trying to frame a more effective policy for the European Union in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easier, of course, to see how our relationship with the parties might consolidate peace in the longer term than to see how the economic relationship could advance peace in the shorter term. I understand the frustration, but nevertheless I remain doubtful about the ability to use economic sanctions.</p>

It is unusual for the Commission to have the last word, having taken Members to task and especially having pointed out that it is not up to a Member to check up on funding granted by the Commission, particularly to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I maintain all that I said about education in Palestine. Even if the European Union does not pay for these books directly, it certainly pays for the teaching.
