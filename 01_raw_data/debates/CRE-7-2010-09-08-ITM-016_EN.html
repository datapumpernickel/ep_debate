<p class="contents">First, I should underline that there is no evidence of any food safety concerns regarding foods obtained from cloned animals. There are, however, some animal welfare issues that require further consideration. Such concerns are nevertheless likely to decrease over time, as the technique evolves and improves. There is, of course, an ethical dimension to this issue, which, I should add, lies outside the EU’s legislative remit. Other considerations in the general debate on this issue are consumers’ rights to know about production processes, and the likely trade implications of taking measures in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important issue for the Commission is to assess the need, feasibility and proportionality of possible measures to regulate the use of the cloning technique and of cloned animals and products. Naturally, I am fully aware of Parliament’s position on the use of cloning technologies for food production in Europe. Honourable Members would like to see a ban extended to the offspring of cloned animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission position is that foods from cloned animals should not be put on the market without prior authorisation, as they are considered novel foods, and indeed are currently covered by the Novel Food Regulation. It is worth adding that, given the value of cloned animals, it is highly unlikely that they would be used directly for food purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation with regard to the offspring of cloned animals is, however, rather different. Such animals cannot be distinguished from those of conventional lineage. This aspect also has to be taken into consideration in any line of action the Commission may propose.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the current position, the Commission acknowledges that the Novel Food Regulation is not the appropriate legal framework for addressing all aspects of the cloning issue. In particular, the production and marketing of products other than food – such as ova, sperm or embryos – cannot be covered by the Novel Food Regulation, which deals exclusively with the pre-market authorisation of food products.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members will know, we are currently putting together a report which will cover all aspects of the use of cloning for food production. That report will be made available in November. It will serve as a useful basis for future discussions among the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to continuing discussions with both Parliament and the Council with the aim of reaching a successful agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both Parliament and Commission agree that the Novel Food Regulation was indeed not the appropriate framework to deal with this issue. We agree on this, which explains why the issue has been withdrawn from the scope of application of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also all aware, at least according to all the scientific committees, that cloned animal meat, and that of its offspring, satisfy all food safety requirements. It is only here that I see a problem. Namely, that it is impossible to distinguish whether or not meat comes from a cloned animal, or the offspring of a cloned animal, or from an animal that has not been cloned. Therefore, there is a need – an essential need – to use labelling and traceability in order for the consumer to be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers want, and have the right, to know if the meat they are eating comes from a cloned animal or not, regardless of knowing whether or not it is healthy, because they may refuse to eat it owing to the issues you have explained, such as animal welfare, or for ethical reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems, therefore, given this situation, that the production and consumption of cloned animals in Europe is probably going to be banned, particularly its production. Thus, we are going to ban our producers from using a new technique, one that is good for animal reproduction and which, moreover, can make a profit, because obviously, an animal is cloned as a result of having very special characteristics, something which has been done in Spain with fighting bulls, where, as you know, two fighting bulls have been cloned.</p>
<p class="contents">And we are going to ban it! Are we going to deny them the possibility of using this technique? Because, if that is the case, then our farmers, our livestock breeders, are going to lose competitiveness. This would be fine if, in Europe, we could ban the entry of meat from cloned animals, and their offspring, from other countries. However, are we going ban it? We cannot do so. The World Trade Organisation is not going to accept our ban. Therefore, we are going to have an absurd situation whereby our livestock breeders are not going to be able to use a new technique that will enable them to become more competitive, yet, we are going to be eating such food in the European Union, with or without a label.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what worries me, and I feel a solution needs to be found. Why are we going to ban it? Why are we going to prevent our livestock breeders from using this technique, only to later bring this food in from outside because we cannot ban its importation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, all forms of biotechnology raise fears among the public, which is particularly sensitive to these issues. Animal cloning is no exception to this rule. It is up to us, as the political decision makers, to promote debate that is sufficiently informed so as to allow us to make an unbiased analysis of the matter. It is important to note that here, I am talking about animal cloning for food production. From the standpoint of food security, this is covered by existing regulations, and the review of new foods has been the subject of a wide-ranging discussion in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent events in the UK this summer have put this issue in the public domain and brought to light an apparent discrepancy between European legislation and its application at national level. The scientific reports drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority point to the conclusion that, for cattle and pigs alone, there are pathologies associated with the development of clones that raise questions about animal welfare. These were considered serious enough for the European Ethical Group to deem animal cloning for food production to be unjustifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">From the standpoint of food security, the same scientific reports concluded that there was no verifiable difference between cow’s milk and beef and pork from healthy clones and their offspring in comparison with the same products from normal animals. However, these reports pointed out that there are only limited data available, and that it has not been possible to carry out extensive studies during the whole lifespan of the clones and their offspring. This leads to some uncertainty as to the conclusions that have already been obtained, and means that there is a need to continue this discussion, based on science, so as to provide answers to the public’s questions without irresponsibly vetoing the possibilities of science.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the presence of the Commissioner and look forward to the report which he will submit to us on the regulation that needs to be applied to cloning technology, as well as the products that have already been obtained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I stress there the word ‘offspring’ of cloned animals, rather than the particular issue of cloned animals themselves, because these are two separate issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to raise here today – as I did with you yesterday, Commissioner, when we met informally – the position that the Innes family in Scotland found themselves in earlier on this summer. They are a long-standing farming family in Scotland who are very dynamic, go-ahead farmers and have always sought to use the best genetics from around the world. They bought a bull bred in the United States, which turned out to have a clone in its parentage. They asked all the right questions at the time about the use of the animal and whether it could be used on the farm. They did not understand that there was any issue with it because it was an offspring of a cloned animal, rather than a cloned animal itself. They now have 90 females bred from that particular bull on farm, and these are worth somewhere in the region of £200 000.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only when they started to consider selling the milk from these animals as they became old enough to produce that they discovered there was a problem. The United Kingdom’s interpretation of the current regulations is that not only the produce from the cloned animal, but the produce from the offspring, is not allowed into the UK food chain. That is an interpretation that was put in place by the Food Standards Agency. That has meant that these animals are worthless, except of course if you move them to another Member State where there is a different interpretation regarding these animals and where milk from these animals would be allowed to enter the food chain, or indeed if you sold them back to the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the problem that we have in terms of lack of consistency across Member States. I think it is in the interests of both consumers and farmers that we get some certainty about this. In terms of Parliament's position, I think that we have gone too far in saying that the meat and milk and products from the offspring of cloned animals should be banned from the system. I think that is wrong and we need to see movement on that. It seems to me that we have to accept that all the scientific evidence suggests there is no difference between these animals which are offspring and any other animals, and they should be allowed into the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that at some stage over the coming months, we can see some compromise and introduce certainty that reassures both consumers and farmers on what is a very sensitive and emotional issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking about an incident that took place in Scotland: a number of bull and cow embryos imported from the United States, reports that meat from at least one of the bulls has definitely entered the food chain and that some of that meat has reached my constituency in Belgium. You have said nothing about that and I would really like to hear some comment from you on this, because this is an important incident, after all. You have said yourself that part of the issue is that consumers have the right to know where their food comes from. Well, some residents in my constituency have not been given that information. They have eaten meat from bulls born in Scotland from imported embryos. I would therefore like to hear what you have to say about this.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that this whole debate is also connected with the conciliation procedure regarding the regulation on novel foods, which we started the day before yesterday, with Kartika Liotard as rapporteur. You know that we are at loggerheads with the Council over this issue. I dare say you are also well aware of the fact that throughout the conciliation procedure – which is to be completed at some point in November, perhaps at the beginning of December but, in any case, sometime during this part of the year – the position taken by the Commission will decide the outcome. You announced in a previous debate in July that you would produce a report and here I will quote you in English as saying: ‘by November 2010’. Now, however, you say ‘at some point in November’, which means at the very end of the conciliation procedure. I should hope, Commissioner, that you and your staff will be a little more dynamic in taking a stance on this issue, because we, as negotiators, will need your position in order to reach an agreement with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, you have you said nothing or, at least, not very much, about the position of Parliament which is in favour of a moratorium. There are commissioners, colleagues of yours, who are, as we speak, lobbying our colleagues not to go along with the moratorium, as that would bring about an enormous trade war, perhaps on a vaster scale than the banana war which we have engaged in with other countries in the field of trade. Could you please comment on that?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to my fellow Members who say that this poses no threat at all to public health, I say ‘Yes, I would like to think that is the case, but let me adhere a little while longer to EFSA’s recommendation that, although there might be no reason to doubt this is the case, the scientific evidence for this is still rather too thin on the ground. I grant you, this recommendation dates from 2008. We should have new recommendations coming soon, but I would prefer to see them before I dare pass any definite judgment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that with these new technologies for food production, we are, as it were, jumping into a swimming pool without first checking if there is any water in it. This concerns genetic modifications, the cultivation of genetically modified plants and cloning. Science has not said its last word on this subject. Science is opening up huge opportunities, but we do not have a full picture of the far-reaching effects of using the new technologies – what effect this will have on biodiversity, the equilibrium between species and the health of people and animals. There are signals which say that cloning is not good for the health of the animals involved, that they are not healthy animals, and that this often involves suffering on their part.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, let us be careful in these matters. We still do not know enough to take such a huge risk. I am therefore in favour of maintaining the ban on cloning animals for meat production in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, the Commission actually made light of this. For two and a half years, and again on 7 July, this Parliament – which is here to represent European citizens – has, by an overwhelming majority, supported my demand for a ban on cloned meat. Therefore, it is not the case, as the Commissioner has suggested, that it will be easy for citizens to recognise cloned meat if it lands on their plates. The fact remains, however, that cloned meat has now entered the food chain. I did not hear the Commissioner say anything about how he intends to prevent that happening again in the future. The only thing he has said is that we will, once again, have to wait, this time until sometime in November. I am totally fed up with all this waiting.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a question for you, Commissioner Dalli: surely, you will not take lying down Commissioner De Gucht’s putting it about behind the scenes that the ban on cloned animals in the food chain demanded by Parliament would lead to a trade war with the United States, Brazil and Argentina. I would rather have a trade war than a war that involves unnecessary bloodshed. Cloning is unethical and extremely cruel to animals. Cloning results in stillbirths on a large scale or in animals having to be destroyed because of deformities. While the Commission is waiting, ambiguities in legislation will lead to this practice invading the European Union, too. The Commission should come up with legislation immediately and this very day impose the moratorium on products from cloned animals and their offspring demanded by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would call on Commissioner De Gucht to stop playing lapdog to the United States and its biotechnology industry. For heaven’s sake, Commissioner, you have been appointed to represent the general interest of the European Union and its citizens and, as a member of the Commission, you are not required to accept the instructions of any government, institution, body or authority, and all I am doing here is citing the Treaty on the European Union. Have things really deteriorated to the point where Europe is allowing our policy to be swayed, to the detriment of our citizens, out of fear of repercussions from the World Trade Organisation? If they are, then right now, I am ashamed of the state of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We face a very similar situation here to the controversy over GM crops. In each case, the objective scientific safety tests have been successfully passed, but in each case, there has been a subjective and emotional backlash that no qualitative test can legislate for.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of GM crops, the Commission has now allowed decisions to be taken by Member States’ elected governments, which, of course, is where all decisions should be taken. This development has only occurred after years and years of stalemate and buck-passing between different EU institutions. It is unsurprising that present EU law is confused over the commercial use of the offspring of cloned animals, and it is certainly not the job of this Chamber to increase this confusion with yet more EU regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The correct procedure here is to allow Member States, with their very different cultures, to decide for themselves whether or not to allow commercial production of these products. Those countries which choose not to must have complete freedom over the method of labelling imports, without EU interference. The use of assurance schemes in such countries will create opportunities for their farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As George Lyon indicated, several issues have emerged in the United Kingdom recently surrounding the marketing of cloned offspring. The lack of a consistent message between the Commission guidance and that of the UK Food Standards Agency has caused a great deal of confusion. This, I must say, is through no fault of the Commission’s, but it has brought hardship to producers and has certainly had an impact on confidence in the safety of food.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unsustainable and illogical that the UK Food Standards Agency regards products from the offspring of cloned animals as novel foods in the United Kingdom, while in other countries across Europe, this is not the case. I am pleased to learn that discussions have taken place on the matter between the Commission and the Food Standards Agency to try to bring clarity for both producers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The nature of a novel food in the context of cloned animals and offspring of a cloned animal must be made clear. With a unified approach on this issue across Europe – and indeed beyond in terms of third country imports – the contradictory advice in the UK which has been offered thus far must cease. As we all know, confidence in both the source and the safety of food is essential. I welcome the Commission’s attempt to keep that confidence in food safety in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I welcome the fact that Mr Dalli is making proposals today concerning the direction in which this regulation should go. I see today’s discussion as the basis for the regulation which we expect the Commission to submit to us in November. For this reason, it is very important that we are having this discussion here today.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that time is pressing and this has already been mentioned today on several occasions. For example, in the USA, at least 150 cloned cattle are being kept for breeding purposes. Then there were the events that took place in the United Kingdom during the summer recess. No one has yet clarified whether this was just a silly season story or whether there really is some truth in it. However, I would like to remind everyone of the reason why we called for the special regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we said that it is not entirely clear whether cloned meat really is completely harmless. This is supported by the fact that only comparisons of the different materials have so far been carried out, in other words, comparisons of meat from non-cloned animals and meat from cloned animals. Therefore, we do not yet have proper proof, as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also said. We need to hold more tests and await the results.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also mentioned a second aspect of the issue, which involves the ethical dimension and animal welfare. It is not correct to say that we have no rights in this area. The Treaty of Lisbon covers the question of animal welfare and we can cite the treaty in the case of transgressions or if animals are constantly put at risk. Of course, we need to clarify this and to obtain the corresponding proof if we are to speak out in favour of a ban. I believe that this is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">If you go into a supermarket and look at the labelling on the joints of beef, you will not be able to prove that what is stated on the labels is correct. This means that it is possible to add information indicating that the meat is cloned to the labelling. We have a register for animals which allows us to track where an animal comes from without it being labelled. We can trace every detail right back to the animal’s ancestors. Therefore, we have the means readily available to prove whether meat comes from a cloned animal or from one that has not been cloned. As the saying goes, a person can disappear, but an animal cannot, because all its details are recorded.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the means and we should use them if we decide to allow cloned meat to be sold. It is possible to prove whether or not meat is cloned, but we need complete traceability and strict labelling in the interests of consumers. In addition, you must not forget the question of animal welfare. We believe that to be very, very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He talks about a report, but what we have heard about here is a real legal loophole where farmers have been put in an impossible position because there is no clarity about what the actual legislation in place now means. We want more than a discussion and a report in November. Even if the Commission brings forward new proposals, it could take 18 months before we have any new law.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interim, before there is any new law and any new clarity, I would strongly recommend that we have a moratorium on food products from cloned animals. I want to echo what Mr Schnellhardt has just said in relation to the Commissioner’s claim that we cannot take on board ethical issues in legislation. That is not correct. The Lisbon Treaty has a provision which states that all EU policies must take animal welfare into account. I wonder whether the Commissioner has read the report by the European Group on Ethics. For colleagues who do not know what this is, it is the group set up by President Barroso to look at the ethical aspects of EU policy. That report states clearly that there are major concerns about animal suffering in connection with cloning and food. It states that there should be further studies on the long-term animal welfare of clones and their offspring.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern the Commissioner has not mentioned is biodiversity. If there are herds of animals which are all from the same cloning family, the report states that this could create huge problems of interbreeding and increased vulnerability of the food supply chain. It also states that there is a problem of cloned meat leading to an increase in meat consumption, with serious environmental consequences. The conclusion of that ethical committee – which is the Commission’s own ethical committee – is that we need more public debate before we allow food from cloned animals onto the market.</p>

You behaved as if nothing had happened. In July, Parliament took up a very clear position and called on you to impose a moratorium. Since then, nothing has been done. We called for draft legislation to be drawn up and nothing has happened there either. A question which I submitted in May in which we asked how many cloned animals and how many offspring of cloned animals were in the system has made it very clear that you are completely clueless. In your answer, you said that we do not know, we cannot say anything about this and we have no idea. In other words, you do not know what is happening, but you are behaving as if it were possible for us to wait until November when you produce your report. That is not good enough. We have called on you to act and so far you have done nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Leinen said is not correct. Parliament has spoken out very clearly in favour of a moratorium on the second generation. We cannot now simply deny that. We must make it very clear that this is also a problem, because all the studies show that this technology has simply not been tested sufficiently. No long-term investigations are taking place. It is becoming obvious in the light of what has happened so far that significant breaches of animal welfare legislation, including that of the European Union, are being committed when animals are cloned. The fact that only 15% of the animals survive and are capable of survival is a clear violation of the EU animal welfare directive. Within the EU, we have the precautionary principle and we must take it seriously. As long as there are risks to health and the technology is not fully developed, we must not experiment with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The public is clearly opposed to cloning for food production. The people of Europe are not waiting for cloned meat to be produced and neither are the farmers. On the contrary, the public takes a very critical view of all of this and ultimately we must not put the critical awareness of consumers at risk. The public expects much more of us. We are expected to handle this topic with great care and not simply to say that it is a new, innovative technology and we will go ahead and use it. We must take a highly critical approach to new technologies, but I suspect that the Commission is not prepared to do this. As is the case in other areas, the Commission has an unshakeable belief in progress. However, we should be asking: Are we on the right track? Are we acting in the interests of consumers and farmers? I believe that we are not. Therefore, you should look seriously at imposing a moratorium and putting some draft legislation on the table, because this is what we are waiting for. The incident in Scotland highlighted the Commission’s inability to act and demonstrated how little it will actually do in cases of this kind. No action was taken at all.</p>
<p class="contents">To go back to the trade issues, we in the European Union have spoken out very clearly against the use of hormones. We have stuck to our position and we can do the same in the case of other matters. This does not involve exposing ourselves to the risk of being forced to accept trade restrictions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A resolution was passed in the vote, in which Members requested a complete ban on the cloning of animals designated for food processing in the European Union, as well as a ban on the import of cloned animals and cloned animal products.</p>
<p class="contents">The adopted text of the resolution took on board the concerns of many European specialists, particularly as far as the health risks connected with the use of cloned animals in the food industry are concerned. Cloning creates serious problems in connection with a high incidence of poor health and the mortality of the cloned animals at an early age in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific and technical findings of the World Organisation for Animal Health suggest that only 6% of cloned embryos result in healthy, long-living clones. This is mainly due to the fact that a clone has, from the outset, the genetic age of the original. Therefore, if the original is a seven-year old cow, the clone will be a calf whose genes are seven years old from the start. Cloning also damages the genome of the individual, which then makes the clone more susceptible to diseases and parasites.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of cloning relate not only to the health and decent living conditions of animals, of course, but also to consumer confidence in the food that might come from such sources. Although the US Food and Drug Administration states that meat and milk products from cloned animals, pigs, sheep, cattle and their descendents are, in its opinion, just as reliable as products produced from animals reared in the current way, I would not consider it wise, Commissioner, for commercial reasons alone, to open the door to such products and to expose the European public to an unjustifiable risk of the consequences of products from cloned animals and their descendants entering the food chain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, the current ban on products from cloned animals must be extended to cover their offspring. We can also put forward ethical reasons for doing this and bring animal welfare arguments into play.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, it is important for us to ensure as soon as possible that consumers are given comprehensive information about the origins of the meat they are buying. Consumers must have the opportunity to choose not to buy specific products. Above all, we must make sure that people are not palmed off with products of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have just heard, products from the offspring of cloned animals have found their way into the food chain in the United Kingdom. However, it is possible that the case in the United Kingdom is not a one-off. Unfortunately, it is likely that the citizens of European countries are eating cloned meat without being aware of it.

The two things cannot be compared. Cloning involves cruelty to animals, as many of my fellow Members have already said. In the discussion which we had before the summer recess, I explained that only a fraction of animal clones are capable of surviving. Many of those which do initially survive go on to die at a very early age in great agony. They have deformed extremities and organs. They have weakened immune systems and are susceptible to disease. This leads to pain, suffering and an agonising death. Can we accept responsibility for this? If we really are in favour of animal welfare, should we be supporting methods of this kind? No, we should not. That is why we decided in July that we did not want cloned meat or the products of cloned animals. This is a consistent approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we know that the products of cloned animals and their offspring probably cause no damage to human health, and personally, I believe that they are suitable for human consumption, but there is no shortage of meat produced by conventional methods. So why should we make use of clones? It is completely unnecessary to treat animals cruelly. The people of Europe do not want this and they do not want these products. We do not need them. There is no argument for introducing cloned meat into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we want a clear regulation which applies specifically to cloned animals and their offspring. I want to see a ban on cloning and cloned products in the European Union and I believe that we can push this through. Of course, it must also apply to imports. I want to be sure that I am not being fobbed off with cloned meat on the quiet, because it is not labelled, as has just happened in Scotland. I do not believe that all meat can be traced back to its origins. This may be possible in the case of beef. However, it is not possible to tell whether there is a cloned animal in the ancestry of a specific pig, because of the amount of pork produced.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fundamental, ethical question. Other Members have said that we need to deal with ethical issues, because we are responsible for them. This is, of course, a question of animal welfare, but it also concerns another issue. Experience shows, and I am a livestock farmer, I have studied this subject, that all the reproduction methods which have been proven to function in livestock rearing eventually find their way into human medicine. Therefore, we must ask ourselves today whether we want and are able to accept human cloning in the possibly not too distant future. I do not want to and I am not able to. Even if a clone was created of me to supply spare parts and, in future, was able to donate a vital organ for my use, I would still not want this to happen. I do not believe that this is an exaggerated horror story. I believe that this would be possible in the not too distant future if we were to permit cloning to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we urgently need a ban not only on cloning, but also on cloned animals and their offspring throughout the EU. I am not afraid of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We can push this through. We do not have to imitate everything that the USA does, despite our transatlantic relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both Linda McAvan and Mrs Sommer, who spoke before me, as well as my fellow Member, Capoulas Santos, talked about this. The arguments have been presented. We have heard the healthcare arguments, that even though there has been research conducted in the USA, we would like objective European research, not influenced by any American interest groups, which actually demonstrates that these products are not detrimental to health. However, even if it is so and they are not detrimental to health, scientific research can be continued. However, I too have heard it said that there are no reasons to continue research. As a full member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I believe that nothing within the European agri-business justifies having cloned food products on our store shelves.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been stated, and I fully agree, that there are loopholes in this system. I recall a recent instance when I contacted you regarding Moroccan fruit and vegetables. This shows that we do need to protect our markets against imports as well. Both Linda McAvan and others have raised animal welfare considerations, and I fully agree with those who spoke before me that science cannot be halted. However, we must draw a line at a certain point and restrain cloning, because neither I nor my assistants would like to come across my clone.

We debated it recently, are still debating it this evening, and will debate it once again when you present your communication on this issue, Commissioner. However, I believe that a very rigorous approach should be adopted when dealing with such a sensitive issue as products from cloned animals in the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard a great deal said about the risks to health. I should just like to point out that our present position is based on that of the European Food Safety Authority, which says that there is currently nothing to indicate that products derived from cloned animals or their offspring pose any new or additional health or environmental risks when compared with conventionally bred animals.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore err on the side of caution. Let us not automatically come down on one side or the other before we are genuinely in possession of all the scientific facts. We must be careful not to adopt a defensive position or, worse, an entrenched position on an issue which is so complex – as our discussions have so clearly shown – and which deserves thorough examination, in particular, with regard to international trade rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, Commissioner, you were right when you said that the risk in Europe is limited. We have a conventional livestock farming industry that is certainly sufficient. What happens, though, when farmers import semen that may come from the US and be obtained from cloned animals? Here, too, we need every possible safeguard so as to ensure that the World Trade Organisation rules are being complied with and that there are no opportunities to create conditions of unfair competition. Our farmers are waiting for such responses, and ultimately, they are the ones who are in difficulty today.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with my fellow Members when they tell us that consumers definitely do not wish to consume meat obtained from these animals. However, I have no doubt at all about Commissioner Dalli’s desire to shed light on this issue and to respond to the many questions that remain unanswered today. I already have every confidence in what Commissioner Dalli may say to us, and I await his report.</p>
<p class="contents">EU consumers must know what they are eating, and traceability is crucial. If we are to ensure this, however, we need a rigorous scientific analysis that will enable us to take informed action, so that we can find a suitable solution to the issue of importing food from cloned animals and their offspring into the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I will wait for Commissioner Dalli’s communication, scheduled for November, before making my decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament has expressed on more than one occasion its view that these foods should be banned for a number of reasons based on ethical and environmental considerations. We will continue to adopt a strong, united stance on this matter at a time when negotiations are being conducted on the subject of novel food regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence provided by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Group on Ethics indicates that there are serious health problems which affect both cloned animals and their surrogate mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in terms of protecting the environment, the impact of the rise in meat consumption could have a devastating effect, and a large number of cloned animals would affect the natural biodiversity, thereby increasing the animals’ vulnerability to epidemics and threatening food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard the arguments relating to trade and World Trade Organisation regulations. We are told that we cannot ban the introduction of these foods in the European Union without breaching the obligations stipulated by the WTO. However, the European Union has decided to stop the introduction of certain products on the market when there have been doubts about the benefits for consumers or concerns that consumers are being misled. We will consider every legal option for implementing such a ban.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, looking at the situation as a whole, we should insist that the WTO regulations also take into account similar ethical and environmental protection considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are serious arguments against foods derived from cloned animals. On the other hand, there is no clear proof of the benefits they provide. It is time for the Commission to propose a concrete solution in relation to this issue which will also take into account the view of our forum which represents Europe’s citizens. We cannot allow experiments which will endanger citizens’ health or the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the one hand, we – the EU – are advocating greater food transparency for consumers, seeking to establish a system for tracing meat from farm to fork, and thus imposing very strict livestock farming and slaughtering standards on livestock breeders and certain controls for guaranteeing, as far as possible, the origin and quality of food. On the other hand, however, we learned this summer that British consumers had unknowingly eaten cloned beef. In my country, Belgium, there is even a possibility that third-generation meat, which we are told is not cloned meat at all, has been consumed. Is this ultimately what we mean when we talk about ‘traceability’?</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to add a touch of humour: as far as I am concerned, I do not want to have cloned beef bourguignon and genetically modified carrots on my plate! And especially if I have not chosen to eat them. This seems to be the prevailing opinion across the EU, since all the Eurobarometer surveys carried out on the issue of cloning animals for food confirm time and again the very clear opposition of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first argument which I wish to cite against the presence of cloned animal products in the food chain: we cannot, on the one hand, call for consumers to be given greater responsibility and want them to be better informed about what they eat and, on the other, ignore their desire not to eat cloned meat.</p>
<p class="contents">My second argument relates to health. It is true that no scientific study has provided proof of any potentially negative impact from consuming cloned meat, meat from the offspring of a cloned animal, or even milk from a cloned animal. Nothing has been proven, and that includes the long-term safety of this type of consumption. I therefore think that the precautionary principle should still be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final argument is an ethical one, and you yourself raised it at the beginning of your speech. The EU wishes to be in the vanguard of animal protection. This afternoon, Parliament once again voted for a restriction on animal experimentation in order to minimise the pain and suffering inflicted on animals. However, there is no denying the fact that cloning causes animal suffering. One need only think back to Dolly and the EFSA Scientific Opinion of July 2008, which states that the health and welfare of a significant proportion of cloned animals has been found to be adversely affected, often severely, and with fatal consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McAvan also referred to the opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, which doubted whether cloning animals for food is ethically justified, particularly as it cannot be justified by a need for food diversification. Quite the contrary: there is reason to fear that the promotion of food from cloned animals will have an indirect effect on genetic diversity due to the excessive use of a restricted number of animals in breeding programmes. This is what has happened in other food sectors; dozens of tomato species have disappeared, for example. In 1900, there were 7 000 species; today, there are only 150 left, 70 of which are commercially available, and a large number of those are genetically modified.</p>

Why is that? For the very simple reason that there is absolute unanimity among the citizens of the European Union, absolute unanimity against cloned products.

<p class="contents">However, what the Commission and its legal advisors need to do is not to highlight these fears but to examine how we can achieve the moratorium sought by plenary without encountering such problems. We really must decide which is more important: the World Trade Organisation or the Treaty of Lisbon, which introduces the principle of caution where provision is made to ban the movement of a product on the European market if the scientific data on it are not clear enough to guarantee its safe trade and we do not know exactly what applies to cloned products.</p>

As regards morality, as Mrs Sommer said, if it is morally acceptable to have cloned animals, then it is only going to be a matter of time until it is morally acceptable to have cloned human beings. We have enough oddballs in the world already without cloning more!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Staes mentioned safety, and I agree with him. How can one conclusively say at this stage that the offspring of cloned animals are safe for human consumption? I do not think one can. Finally, on traceability, one of our great achievements in the European Union, as Anne Delvaux said, is that we can trace food from the stable to the table. What are we going to do now: guarantee that we can trace it from clone to home? I do not think we should be doing this. Our aim should be to eliminate cloning, not to facilitate it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This received intensive media coverage and has led to uncertainty among consumers, on the one hand, and to unjustified accusations, on the other. Because the British Food Standards Agency was unable to come up with an explanation, the issue was immediately blamed on the reporting habits of the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dalli, the results of delays in the EU legislative procedure must not be blamed on farmers. Until now, only products of cloned animals and not those of their offspring have required a licence in Europe. The European Parliament expressed its opinion clearly in the Novel Food Regulation. The precautionary principle must particularly apply in the case of food.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of the ethical considerations, we do not need meat from cloned animals for the sake of food supply security. There are apparently serious interinstitutional differences of opinion on the handling of cloned foods.

The results of scientific research which are available today show that in terms of quality, the meat of cloned animals does not differ in any way from the meat of animals from conventional production. In spite of this, the question of cloning itself and the use of such technologies in food production are very serious problems. With modern techniques of food production at our disposal, do we have to resort to cloning? Therefore, it is in the interests of farmers, food producers and consumers for these matters to be regulated, not just so that they do not pose a threat to food security, consumer health or the competitiveness of European agriculture.

A Eurobarometer survey carried out on this subject in 2008 shows that most Europeans are opposed to animal cloning, especially for the purposes of producing food. In the view of 84% of respondents, we do not have sufficient experience regarding the long-term impact for health and food safety to use cloned animals in food production. Seventy-five percent believe that cloning food for consumption is unacceptable on ethical grounds. These are significant percentages which convey a very clear message. People do not want to eat products obtained from cloning, they do not have confidence in it and do not agree with these methods. We must supplement and improve EU legislation so that there is never again the possibility of exerting pressure on, or getting round, principles or decisions in which we believe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, while encouraging innovations, we must not forget the dangers either. One of these is the marketing of cloned animals, their offspring and products obtained from cloned animals. So far, this issue has caused considerable problems, related to several different aspects. These include animal welfare requirements, anchored in the Treaty of Lisbon, the right of consumers to be informed of the origin of products consumed and ethical issues. So far, we have more questions than answers in each of these areas. Hence, before the discussions by the European Union institutions about cloned animals gather momentum, we must carefully view the marketing of these animals, their offspring and products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
