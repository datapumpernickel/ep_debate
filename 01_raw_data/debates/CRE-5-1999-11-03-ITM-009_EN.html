It also recommends that this decision should be forwarded to the Council and Commission. So I could just sit back and stop talking now, after just 20 seconds. On the other hand, it is certainly worth asking why we need this agreement right now. We all know from experience that cooperation with Russia, with Russian researchers, has constantly improved and increased in recent years, both in terms of the number of researchers and as regards budget lines. However, cooperation has been spread over a number of different programmes, including, and this is just one example, the INTAS programme – the International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the new Independent States of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago I was rapporteur for the INTAS programme, and I must say that for me it was an excellent example of how it was possible to build up a cooperation network despite adverse technical conditions and despite poor infrastructure. Besides that, it was also a very good example – I am mentioning this to you, Commissioner, in case you were not yet involved in those days – of how researchers can take research policy into their own hands, which did not always best please the Commission officials at the time!</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that the experiment as it was carried out at that time was worthwhile. We now have the EUREKA and COST programmes and the ISTC in Moscow, for example, and we need to provide a more formal framework for all this cooperation; that is also the point of this agreement. We will also make sure that the agreement is actually implemented in accordance with the principles set out in Article 3. It must be of mutual benefit. This is not about development policy, it is about cooperation in the field of research. There must be a timely exchange of information, of all information which may affect cooperative activities. There must be a balanced realisation of economic and social benefits by the Community and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we now have this improved structural framework, we still need to emphasise several points. For one thing, in my conclusions, I have accepted the proposal from the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities. We have assumed that the need to increase the involvement of women in the projects financed will actually be taken into account, although it has to be said that Russia is not exactly at the bottom of the class in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we recognise the need to increase private sector involvement in the drawing up and implementation of programmes, and also the need to aim for closer cooperation between the relevant parliamentary committees of the parties to the agreement. There is sometimes a lack of concrete political dialogue. We could also perhaps use modern means of communication somewhat more, so as to reduce travel costs and allow rapid ad hoc contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Parliament we would like to stress that we expect the Commission to provide us with an overview of all cooperation activities between the European Union and Russia in the field of research and technological development. We have already asked many specific questions, and we are now awaiting detailed answers. Cooperation on nuclear matters is excluded from this agreement, and I consider that to be quite right and proper. We would, however, like to mention here that these matters have been the subject of separate EURATOM negotiations, and that we are also expecting clear and unambiguous information from the Commission about these, as was indeed promised to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think this is the right place to use rejection of a research agreement as a means of signalling to Russia that we expect concrete and rapid efforts to achieve a peaceful solution in Chechnya. There are other political means of achieving that. Nevertheless, I have to agree with Mr Brok: it can never feel so painful as it does now to vote for an agreement, even if rationally we fully support the objectives behind it! So I really am in two minds, and I would just like to cautiously mention that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group supports the line that has been chosen. Technical cooperation is important, of course. Russia has considerable scientific resources, especially in the field of basic research, and a large proportion of it remains untapped and unutilised in an international context. The unstable situation in the country has not interrupted research work, although it too is experiencing difficulties. There is a shortage of available funds, salaries are delayed, and it is difficult to produce scientific publications; the shelves of the shops are filled with cheap literature: thrillers, sex and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 1993 – 1998 period, the European Union financed cooperation in the area of techno-scientific research to the tune of approximately EUR 140 million. 35,000 scientists from Russia have been involved in these projects. Quite a number of government officials seem to be travelling into Russia, too. I would be obliged if the Commission could inform us as to what the proportion of officials is to scientists. Currently, EUR 90,000 is spent each year on meetings and travel. </p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is one area of research cooperation. I would also like it to cover organic production, for example. In Russia, small farmers have actually been compelled to switch to organic production because they cannot afford chemical fertilisers. They are therefore surprisingly close to the organic ideal that we aspire to here. Cooperation would also be important where industrial methods and organisation are concerned. We could make significant progress in that area. There is also talk about “the technology of the information society” being part of the cooperation referred to in the agreement. But why is the content sector of the information society not included? In many ways, Russia is a very content-rich country. Where content is concerned, we are lagging behind our main competitor, the United States, and the Russians really do have very different angles, which ought to be exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to refer to the war in Chechnya, where the relentless fighting continues – or bombing, to be exact. The number of refugees is on the increase, and conditions have become horrific. The Russian leadership refuses to react to any of this. The real victims are now civilians, not the terrorists, as they call the Chechen rebels. It seems more and more likely that this is all part of the Russian election campaign. Those responsible for the explosions in Moscow have not been found, or have at least not been charged. This amounts to pulverisation of a nation, and I believe we should become more seriously involved, in order to make Moscow listen and take heed. This is something that cannot be tolerated.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cooperation between the EU and Russia should be continued and developed. The agreement now under discussion will provide a better framework than ever for this. The cooperation process has been slowed down by the fact that it has become fragmented and is being administered by many different authorities, especially on the Russian side. The agreement now under consideration will bring the widespread cooperation activities within the sphere of a more effective coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise the importance of cooperation, particularly in the field of environmental and climatic research, and within the framework of information technology and telecommunications. The cooperation that takes place in these areas also reflects positively on Russia’s neighbours. Through techno-scientific cooperation we can also promote the exploitation of natural resources of North-Western Russia, which are of great importance for the future development of the economies of both Russia and the EU. At the same time, I would hope that developing techno-scientific cooperation will direct practical cooperative projects to the right places and improve, inter alia, the implementation and success of the research framework programme and projects funded through the TACIS and the Interreg programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Practical projects must be coordinated more efficiently; they must be increasingly target-oriented and their timetabling and scheduling improved. We must also see to it that projects that have been started are brought to a conclusion within their allocated time span. We must also insist that the Russian side adhere to their part of the project. In recent years, many projects have been implemented ineffectively, they have dragged on for an unreasonable long period, and some of them have even been abandoned. To a certain extent, this has detracted from the interest in practical cooperation with Russia. The results of research work must increasingly be utilised for improving the environmental conditions and economy of Russia. I believe that the cooperation agreement will further the implementation of these objectives.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore fully agree with Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and with the subsequent speakers in essence. But I would nevertheless like to express two very specific reservations that I have. </p>
<p class="contents">We know that the nuclear aspect is excluded from this agreement. Negotiations on this are taking place within the framework of Euratom. A great deal of uncertainty remains in this respect, despite agreements between the Commission and Parliament – the KEDO agreement which is due for renewal. Pursuant to this KEDO agreement, Parliament should be kept abreast of the state of affairs within the Euratom negotiations. This was not the case. The Chairman, Mr Westendorp, has therefore written to Mr Lamy whose reply was received today. In his reply, he wrote that negotiations started in 1994 regarding the nuclear segment and nuclear fusion were completed but not signed. We can only guess why. There are formal objections, according to some. But we do not really know what is behind all this. Official confirmation from the Russians is pending. Furthermore, and this is something new, investigative talks on cooperation are said to be taking place regarding the trade in nuclear material. You will understand that we are very concerned about this in our group and that this is raising further questions. </p>
<p class="contents">The ambiguities in the field of the nuclear segment and our concern with regard to this would, in fact, be sufficient to formulate a reservation and to say, for example: we want both finalised simultaneously. But these days, there is an even larger problem looming. It has also been touched upon by previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidents are taking place in Chechnya which are forcing us to rethink. In view of the fact that Russia continues to terrorise Chechen citizens with bomb attacks and traps people, men, women and children like rats, we cannot sit by and watch or look the other way and preach business as usual. The European Parliament needs to give a clear signal in the short term. Pressure on Russia must be stepped up so that it respects the human rights in Chechnya. We demand this as emphatically as we did for Kosovo. We condemn the Russian military intervention and the humanitarian crisis it caused. The fact that the civilian population cannot even take refuge flies in the face of all international rules. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to consider and ask you to consider with me whether we should formally postpone this vote tomorrow to allow us to present our opinions tomorrow.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly against the background of anti-western feelings being deliberately fanned amongst the Russian population, this specific agreement gives out a clear, positive signal to the citizens of Russia. The EU hopes to serve their welfare and life interests just as well. This is clearly evidenced in the list featuring areas of cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework of thought, there is space for joint regional and local research projects, as well as non-governmental ones. However, quite the opposite can be observed on the Russian side. The grip of the central government is becoming tighter in true Russian style. This then begs the question as to whether in the event that this agreement is implemented effectively, European interests will be satisfactorily aligned with those of Moscow. For example, in all honesty, does the Russian government attach the same importance to ecological disasters as we do? Past experience does precious little to put our minds at rest on this crucial point – after all, the health of people inside and outside our own borders is at stake. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, European persistence in elementary, humanitarian research fields is needed very urgently indeed within the framework of this agreement. For the first time, relatively minor research programmes come into their own for this exercise, whereby we remind our Russian partners consistently of the mutual obligations entered into. After all, if we are to avoid further western disenchantment in the East then we must take our own precautionary measures. I thank you and the rapporteur, in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This involves working towards cooperation from which both sides can benefit. Russia will always be one of Europe’s main providers of raw materials. That is why this is important for us, as we can only maintain our own prosperity by seeking such cooperation. And of course we also have to consider, no matter how masochistic this might perhaps sound, that in the long run we will also have to offer fair prices for raw materials. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, of course, ignore Chechnya. It represents a vital issue and an enormous challenge. We should remember that it was precisely these Caucasian territories round the Caspian Sea that were the cause of conflicts a hundred years ago, because they were geographically strategic, just as they are today. After all, these events shaped the twentieth century as we know it. I believe that this area, research, provides a way of defusing one of the main causes of such conflicts – the battle for raw materials. So the research aspect here is also very important as regards renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point is that the non-nuclear component of these research projects must be given clear priority. We have seen what is happening on the nuclear side. We need to be aware whenever we are considering Russia that it represents one of the most important challenges for the next century in terms of strategic geography.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that you covered all the essential points. I would just like to confirm that a very important aspect of this agreement is that of mutual interest, unlike in other agreements, such as TACIS, which are unilateral assistance projects </p>
<p class="contents">As far as women are concerned, we agree entirely with the Commission’s report of February 1999 on Women and Science, and we will ensure that we encourage the presence of women in the fifth framework programme. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you rightly spoke of the issue of private companies, and we also feel, as you do, that the presence of companies in the project for collaboration is a central element for the whole framework-programme and which is particularly important in this kind of agreement. Of course there is also the question of the summary document on the different points that have already been made in terms of information. I believe that you have already received a series of particular items of information, but I shall shortly be sending you a summary document, which will give an overview. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the more specific question on nuclear power and Mr Lamy, you know, as Mrs Maes alluded to it, that Mr Lamy has today sent a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, in which he sums up the situation and in which he says quite clearly, and I am answering Mrs Maes at the same time, that we do not yet have the official confirmation from Russia which we need in order to proceed to the signing of the decision of 12 December 1994. Thus, as far as the answer that Mr Lamy has just given you is concerned, it is the Russians who are holding up this agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to tell other speakers that electronic resources, both for information and for communication, are heavily used by researchers, and that they already use them as much as they can. This use must obviously be developed even further. This will moreover contribute to a greater exchange of information and of developments in common. </p>
<p class="contents">More fundamentally, as far as the political issue that has been raised over Chechnya is concerned, I obviously share your questions and your distress, but the question is this: until now, the European Union has neither suspended nor curtailed its diplomatic relations with Russia, because we feel that we must always maintain channels for dialogue with Russia in order to get our messages across, including those which express our concern about what is happening in Chechnya. I would, moreover, like to remind you that the Union, through the Finnish Presidency, informed the Russian Government and its Prime Minister, Mr Putin, of its deep concern, at the European Union-Russia summit of 22 October 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why, in this matter, whilst sharing Parliament’s concerns about the gravity of the situation in Chechnya, neither do I think, and I fully understand your position on this matter, that this agreement is the best way to show our concerns and our questions about what is happening. </p>
<p class="contents">Like all of you, I have been affected by the events that have taken place. I think that this agreement is of great importance for dialogue and for the promotion of cooperation in the area of technological research and development. This agreement is therefore a positive thing. It has been questioned, but we think that it will be a positive step in our relations with Russian researchers, and from there, towards the construction of the best possible area of freedom and trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
