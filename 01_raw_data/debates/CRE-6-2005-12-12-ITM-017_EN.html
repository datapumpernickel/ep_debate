<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mechtild Rothe (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am glad that we will, tomorrow, be adopting the directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services. That is not a matter of doubt now that the compromises reached with the Council seem certain to be supported by all the groups in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and to those who assisted us, cooperation with all of whom was excellent and certainly made an essential contribution to our achieving a result. While this result is less than what the Commission proposed and certainly far less than what Parliament sought at first reading, I do assert that it is a credible one. It requires the Member States, over a period of nine years, to make energy savings of at least 9%, which is less than the 11.5% that Parliament was asking for. It is also the case that these targets – contrary to what both the Commission and Parliament wanted – are not binding. Even so, I think we were right not to let this stand in the way of an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have not been able to agree on binding targets, the directive does contain specific requirements for action at the national level. With effect from mid-2007, the Member States will be required to draw up, on a regular basis, that is to say initially every four years and thereafter every three, energy efficiency action plans, which they must then send to Brussels. These action plans shall contain the Member States’ planned measures to achieve the targets, which might well include projects to renovate buildings, the promotion of energy-efficient equipment or of energy audits, car-free days and major educational and information campaigns. These action plans are to lay particular stress on the public sector, to which the directive gives an exemplary role. The intended result of this directive is the establishment, by means of indicators and benchmarks, of new energy efficiency standards throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is enormous potential for us to make savings, and it really is high time that we made better use of it. Between 20% and 30% of our present energy consumption could be cut without our sustaining any economic losses whatever; that amount is equivalent to the energy consumed by six Member States, namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece and the Netherlands taken together. At a time when energy prices are high, it is incomprehensible that better use is not being made of this potential, and another remarkable thing about this is that it was very difficult to achieve this result, with a number of Member States being unwilling to go any further.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive can and must usher in a real drive for energy efficiency. Where demand for energy is concerned, there is considerable ground for us to make up. While there are some Member States – Denmark is one of them – that have exemplary energy saving policies with binding targets, there are others that will have to start virtually from square one. The directive also aims to create a real market for energy services, which would be offered by distributors and vendors of energy as well as by independent service providers. The new European legislation will also have the important effect of affording consumers greater transparency, with, for example, energy meters tailored as closely as possible to the individual’s needs, and a regular account of consumption that makes it possible to compare one’s own consumption with that of a control group.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Piebalgs deserves a great deal of congratulation for declaring energy efficiency to be his priority. This directive is a vitally important element in any strategy to that end. What matters now is that it be transposed and implemented, and I hope that the Commission will cast a critical eye over the Member States to ensure that this really is done in a satisfactory manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, it is an umbrella directive for all that is being done and should be done on energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament made significant progress on this directive at first reading. Now, at second reading, the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and the shadow rapporteurs have continued to improve the proposals. They have further developed a number of essential elements in the common position and have successfully negotiated a package of compromise amendments which will reshape and improve the proposal even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question of targets, I, like most of you, regret that a compromise has only been possible without binding targets, but the final version of the amendments introduces a number of binding measures, which strongly compensates for the loss of binding targets. While the targets are now indicative, Member States must still commit to adopting and aiming to achieve national energy savings targets, and to taking cost-effective measures designed to achieve these targets. Moreover, impacts of the measures taken to meet the targets will be quantified using a harmonised measurement system. Member States will also have to plan their measures and report their results in national Energy Efficiency Action Plans. These will be assessed by the Commission, and for the Commission, this is an acceptable construction.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to assure Parliament that the mandate given to the Commission to develop a system of benchmarks, top-down indicators and bottom-up measurements, will be used wisely and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">For the public sector, there is no separate target in the compromise, but a number of binding measures. Member States must publish mandatory public procurement guidelines for energy efficiency improvement. Furthermore, they must select and use a number of public procurement requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission would have preferred a separate public sector target, we feel that these elements, and the requirement to include the public sector in the national action plans, will compensate for the lack of a separate target. Article 13 on metering and informative billing of energy consumption has also been improved compared to the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The reporting requirements for Member States and the Commission in Article 14 have been strengthened and these, together with the measurement system, will make Member States’ achievements quantifiable and visible. Although this activity will put an increased burden on the Commission, we welcome the challenge. I can promise Parliament an adequate internal allocation of resources for this task.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I have on earlier occasions said that energy efficiency is one of the main priorities of this Commission. That will remain so throughout our mandate period. This new directive is expected to be a valuable tool for achieving that goal. I would like to thank Parliament for that and assure it that the tool will be used as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and the shadow rapporteurs for their commitment, their very constructive cooperation and hard work in reaching an agreement at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must therefore take pleasure from the fact that we have been able to reach an agreement amongst the institutions which has the majority support of this House. Within this context, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Mechtild Rothe, on her magnificent work and the other shadow rapporteurs on their constructive attitude throughout the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is intended to promote the development of an energy services market which, although it is already in existence, is not sufficiently well known to the final customers. We are presenting options that do not require additional investments, such as energy savings contracts, the amount of which is paid with the equivalent of the energy bill saved following the alterations.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive also attempts to influence the consumer habits of the citizens. In this respect, it is the appropriate approach to take in order to provide them with detailed information about their real consumption and savings potential, if certain measures are taken, such as the use of intelligent meters.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the public sector, we must stress the exemplary role that the Member States must play by including energy efficiency criteria for public contracts. Over the first nine years they will draw up three energy efficiency action plans, which will detail the measures taken and the future objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by reiterating that our group is entirely satisfied with this agreement, since we believe that realistic objectives, accompanied by economically viable and technically possible measures, are the ideal formula for achieving positive results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has done much excellent work and we in our group strongly support her.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, which actually invests in energy use efficiency, is once again an example for other continents to follow. We are setting an example to the rest of the world, because serious and effective measures need to be taken, with climate change threatening us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The target 1% per annum in additional savings will be tough. In my country, for example, it will be thought impossible as a goal to be achieved every year unless the initial energy-effective situation we already have is taken into consideration. It is obviously unfair that some of the energy savings work that has already been actively carried out should be ignored just because it has been carried out too early, so to speak. It is therefore reasonable not to punish those who have already invested in efficiency before leaving it too late. Moreover, in my country we already refer to guidelines for energy-efficient public procurement and buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, then, the Kyoto negotiations may be continued on the basis of the outcome of the Montreal Summit. May we work effectively in negotiations, as they will not succeed just with the help of technology: people, leaders and politicians will also be needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular we were disappointed that the target for energy-efficiency savings has been set at only 9% over 9 years, instead of the 11.5% proposed by Parliament at first reading. We would also have liked the targets to be binding, but it is good that the compromise at least lays down certain mandatory actions, including public procurement requirements and the introduction of energy-efficiency action plans, which will be used to measure Member States’ progress towards the energy-saving targets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a particular word about the metering and billing proposals in Article 13. These are essential because they establish the fundamental principle that consumers have a right to information about how much energy they are using. It is only when people have such knowledge that they can start to adapt their behaviour and choose energy-saving options. I am very pleased that the compromise text requires electricity and gas customers to be provided with individual meters that accurately reflect their actual energy consumption and give information on the time of use.</p>
<p class="contents">The text also includes a requirement for information on energy use and cost to be provided with customers’ bills and crucially it requires billing to be provided on the basis of actual consumption, not estimated consumption, and to be frequent enough to enable people to work out for themselves how to be more energy efficient. Now that bills will have to be based on actual consumption, utility companies will no longer be able to issue estimated bill after estimated bill, which has led to widespread debt problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this directive marks the start of a new era in which across Europe we will all become much wiser about the way we use energy and I hope the House will support the compromise wholeheartedly. I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, very much indeed for all the work she has put in to get this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive not only brings the day closer when we can develop this potential, but also complements the opening-up of Europe’s gas and electricity markets. Alongside competition in the production and sale of electricity and gas, this directive will make for more vigorous competition in relation to investments in energy-saving technologies, in what are called ‘negawatts’. Particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises, this market is potentially worth billions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is good about this directive? One good thing in it is the concept of national action plans, the first of which has to be submitted by June 2007, after which the Commission will have six months in which to suggest any improvements that it thinks necessary. After three years, an assessment or evaluation will be carried out, and the next plan will then be drawn up, which will incorporate the lessons learned, not only from the successes and failures of one national plan, but those learned from the successes and failures of 25 or 27 of them. That means that we, in Europe, can really get serious about saving energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, harbour any illusions about this: when debate turns to energy efficiency, it is often the case that people invoke a general consensus – one that I, however, do not believe actually exists. The real reason why the big energy companies, like RWE and E.ON, fought this directive tooth and nail behind the scenes in the Commission, in this House and in the Council, right up to the very end, is that the prospect of a market in the saving of energy terrifies them. It is for that reason that these companies, aided by their sympathisers in parliaments and governments, have seen to it that none of the targets are binding. While I do regret this, I have not yet given up hope that all of them – particularly, in future, the members of the national parliaments – are capable of learning and will imitate the Danish model: a binding 1.7% is what we need in the other countries too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For Europe, that means guaranteeing security of supply, an area in which we are too dependent on third countries. We need to address the massive increase in costs, which will have repercussions on the Union’s economy, and to reduce the environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of meeting the Kyoto targets. To do this, concerted efforts at European level can no longer be put off, and the first line of defence is to focus on energy saving and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is not as forceful as we might have hoped; the compromise is far from being perfect and there are no binding targets, only indicative ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The target of 1% per year over nine years is far short of the recognised potential savings, which exceed 30%. The public sector will not have more stringent requirements, as Parliament had requested. The transport sector is only marginally affected by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the decision to endorse the compromise reflects more general thinking. The directive can create incentives aimed at immediately reducing energy demand. It has been accepted that there is a need for more transparent energy billing systems, which can help users to adopt an energy-saving approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The information contained in the energy efficiency action plan can act as an incentive to make the Member States behave properly, particularly if the review system can guarantee that the results will be evaluated on the basis of bottom-up calculation models.</p>
<p class="contents">The hope is that the directive might contribute to creating a real energy services market, guaranteeing equal opportunities and quality in terms of services through the use of targeted incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">A decisive political decision in favour of technologies that increase energy efficiency is crucial to give fresh impetus to innovation and European competitiveness, that is to say, to make this directive an effective instrument for fulfilling the Lisbon Strategy. What we are talking about is a means of investing resources to create new jobs, instead of continuing to pay out to the large oil companies.</p>

While it is true to say that energy efficiency is a most important instrument for solving Europe’s energy problem, it is not the only means to that end. Finding the right ways in which to do this is something that needs to be worked at, and that has been achieved outstandingly well in the compromise reached between first and second readings. For that I wish to extend warm thanks to Mrs Rothe.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise has managed to take a more realistic view of things, to take differences seriously and to refrain from imposing the same targets on everyone. It is very important that we should take seriously the differences in the Member States, the options and differences in the various areas, fields and markets, and so I am very glad that the benchmark approach has been adopted and that the Commission has been mandated to further develop it in order to take the various motivations into account.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for incentives to foster transparency, and a need for less cumbersome bureaucracy, since data for many areas is already available, along with market-oriented thinking, since the suppliers of energy-efficient equipment would then have a sales pitch and a vested interest in the markets for energy-efficient products in the individual states becoming more like each other rather than drifting further apart. The ability to compare sales figures in each market segment with those of the previous year would then equip them with a readily usable instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy efficiency sector affords us a massive opportunity to work towards what is, in principle, a shared goal. We can now try to move this process forward in another way, and perhaps even faster, in that we rely on the self-interest of the parties involved, treating each as individuals rather than adopting a ‘one size fits all’ approach. It is for that reason that I hope we can end up achieving better results than we might have done with requirements imposed by a central authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no mean achievement to work out around fifty compromises with the Council and the five different factions of Parliament. In view of the forward-looking and very positive results, I would like to indicate that this draft is only the first step in enhancing energy consumption efficiency. This is something that we should not forget when we start addressing the financing issues of the implementation. In Hungary there are 800 000 prefabricated flats, where heating constitutes 54% of the household running costs. The individual modernisation of these flats is an absolute necessity if we want to improve energy efficiency. This would cost in excess of 40 000 euros per flat, with a payback period of 25 years. In view of the low financing capacity of the population and local governments, the Hungarian state has started a large scale, long term refurbishment project of prefabricated flats. Basically this means that the state advances the funds required for the modernisation work to the consumers, and the population repays them from their energy savings. We spent 15 million euros on this project in 2004, and 32 million euros in 2005. It will be very important to remember, when we work on the 2007-2013 budget of the European Union, that in order to reach the important energy efficiency targets stipulated in the currently debated draft, more than half a million, mostly modest households will need financial assistance from the European Union in Hungary only. Thank you for your attention, on their behalf, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time Europe is becoming increasingly dependent on imported fossil fuels, and this has a serious impact on its energy security. For this reason the European Union is wrestling with two major challenges in the area of energy: how to reduce its dependence on imports, and how to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in line with the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol as well as after its expiry. In both cases we can make use of the as yet unexploited possibility of efficient energy use.</p>
<p class="contents">In formulating the directive on energy end-use efficiency we had the choice of two approaches. The first approach would have involved opting for slightly more ambitious indicative targets, and the second for less ambitious, very realistically attainable binding targets. I take the view, however, that the current proposal contains a combination of the two approaches – indicative as well as very realistic targets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like them to be a little more ambitious. It makes sense to me that we should set ourselves binding targets. I also believe that targets set higher for the public sector would set a good example for the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware, however, that current European reality has a somewhat bitter aftertaste – we are neither able or skilful enough to reach agreements, and we have no support for our work. We must therefore be especially careful to define the targets in such a way that they can be fulfilled. Only in this case can the directive encourage individual countries and people to implement appropriate measures. People’s confidence in the rationality contained in the substance of Europe’s legal system must be improved, while the directive must also serve to improve the reputation of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that Member States draw up three reports on efficient energy use, and that the fulfilment of commitments be closely monitored, will require more work and impose a greater administrative burden. Yet it is only this kind of approach that is responsible, serious and able to produce appropriate results.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I welcome the goal that you have chosen as the most important in this term, and I support the directive on energy end-use efficiency. I believe that this very directive is a prime example of how joint European action can yield added value, and not simply in financial terms. Transparent operations, continuous exchange of information and the formulation of good practices in this field throughout Europe are indeed essential if the targets are to be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen the debate on the north European gas pipeline. We have also had headlines on the transit agreement between Ukraine and Russia concerning gas supplies. There has been an accident at a depot storing oil products near London. These issues usually grab the headlines. Energy efficiency is now attracting attention but has not yet made the front page.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are indirect indications that the policies the European Parliament and the Member States are pursuing are producing results. I shall mention just two examples that are encouraging. Firstly, China has started to use the target approach: it aims to decrease its energy intensity by 20% by 2010. That is not a huge step, but it is the same target-based approach. It is ambitious, but perhaps it could be even more ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am encouraged by the reaction of the OPEC countries on the oil price forecast for the near future. They forecast strong growth in consumption in the United States and China. They have avoided mentioning Europe. So, from their point of view, Europe is doing reasonably well. However, we must not be complacent. This directive is really necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a few comments on what has been said. I am really grateful to both representatives from the new Member States, Mrs Herczog and Mr Jordan Cizelj, because the biggest difficulty we had in the Council was with the new Member States. That was paradoxical because the issue had been seen as perhaps an obstacle to growth. In fact, it is the opposite: it gives a chance for growth. I will continue to explain to the new Member States that they do not in fact need to consume a lot of energy per capita, and can even now gain the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Reul that this is a huge opportunity, and we should use it. I agree with Mr Guidoni that perhaps we could be more ambitious in the air transport sector, but it is there in the directive, and this will also provide an opportunity to deal with energy efficiency in that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Danish example, I believe that, in this directive, all other Member States will follow because the suspicion will not be there. I think that industry will discover that its profits will not decrease because of energy efficiency being in place – indeed, perhaps the opposite, as it provides new chances for growth in that sector as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that metering and billing are important because transparency will make a real difference to the consumer. We need to change not only the approach of the supplier but that of the consumer. That could be done through clear, transparent and correct information. Only then will the consumer start to change. The directive also takes into account the initial situation on energy efficiency. We will not punish the countries that started earlier. They could use this for achieving the target. But at the same time, I think that, with the development of new technologies, there will be a huge opportunity for energy savings and energy efficiency even in the most progressive countries. The strange thing is that the country that had been supporting mandatory targets was Denmark – from which, in other circumstances, we could have expected bigger opposition – and the countries that have done most in terms of end-use potential said that they had no particular difficulties with mandatory targets. So, by doing, you learn something.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the energy services market is extremely important. It gives opportunities not only for energy efficiency, but for employment and growth in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With this recommendation amending the text of the common position, we are very close to finalising the legislative process on the energy end-use efficiency and energy services proposal. I am pleased to confirm that the Commission can accept the outcome of the compromise between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to invite Parliament now to support the compromise package which reflects important changes that the rapporteur, together with the shadow rapporteurs, has achieved during a long and difficult process. Although, given the challenge to Parliament and also the Council, it was not so long, it was a very difficult compromise. But, at the end of the day, there were very fruitful negotiations, and I think the proposal, as it stands now, is perhaps even better than the initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again like to thank the rapporteurs for this achievement. Now we need to deliver from the Commission side and also from the Member States’ side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
