Since the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted, it has been the European Parliament’s frame of reference when drawing up its annual report on fundamental rights, a report which is an essential part of our parliamentary life. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is effectively seen as a definitive set of guidelines. For 2003, however, we have taken a slightly different approach, looking at only a few articles of the Charter and comparing them with what we find in reality and practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question we might ask is why is the European Parliament interested in fundamental rights? Well, my answer is that this House is the expression of the people’s sovereignty and it is therefore bound to speak out on matters directly affecting the citizens, especially where their dignity is concerned, since its main role is to represent them and to defend their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Public freedoms and fundamental rights are enshrined in our constitutions and in our national and European laws. The draft European Constitution even includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its preamble. The European Parliament’s legitimacy in matters relating to fundamental rights has been strengthened by Article 7. It may, on the basis of a reasoned proposal, formally notify the Council where there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6. In this respect, this report should strengthen the European Parliament’s capacity to carry out its role in monitoring fundamental rights within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the fourth report. As you know, the report is written by a different political group every year. This year, I had the pleasure of preparing it. In this report, we have tried to gauge the effectiveness of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to gauge their effectiveness in respect of all individuals, irrespective of gender, ethnic or cultural origin, sexual orientation, religion, handicap or status. Since 11 September 2001 in particular, we have seen an enormous number of measures taken at both EU and national level to combat terrorism, transnational crime and illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in the name of EU security, limits are being imposed on our public freedoms and fundamental rights. Many measures are directly or indirectly affecting a number of vulnerable groups and social movements. However justified the fight against crime, insecurity and terrorism may be, it should under no circumstances be allowed to undermine fundamental rights and democratic freedoms since this would threaten the very foundations of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore chosen to take as the report’s underlying theme the criminalisation of social movements and vulnerable groups. Target groups which we have identified include trade unions, support and human rights groups, migrants and refugees, victims of trafficking in human beings, Roma and gypsies, journalists, women, children and people with impaired mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">My attention has been drawn to three points in particular, which I would like to outline to you briefly. So far as the freedom of the press is concerned, the existence of free pluralist media strengthens the principle of democracy. On the question of media pluralism, we have just put to the vote a report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on the risks of the violation thereof in the European Union and especially in Italy. I will not therefore go over the matter again, but I would like to remind you that her report refers to the provision of information to EU citizens and the duty of the media and institutions to respect the citizen’s right to be fully and objectively informed. The right to objective information is vulnerable to that information being politically manipulated. Unfortunately, we saw some examples of this in the United Kingdom at the time of the Iraq war and in France during the heat wave.</p>
<p class="contents">The report shows, for example, that some governments have a virtual monopoly and that in some countries television, the private sector or the press are highly concentrated. The freedom of the press and unfortunately often our rights, too, are threatened by this very concentration of the media and the pressure that some journalists find themselves under when providing their information, because of their political or ideological affiliation. The directive will therefore have to be amended to require Member States to preserve media pluralism and strengthen the protection of confidential sources.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the right of asylum. Europe’s humanist tradition of asylum rights is being replaced by a closed-border security policy. Laws are not yet harmonised, a variety of national laws are often used to restrict the right of asylum and the treatment meted out in detention centres and living conditions in them are far from ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must of course be able to guarantee the right to health and to ensure that all citizens enjoy that right. All rights of this nature are linked to citizenship and we are well aware that European citizenship cannot be built without these rights in today’s Europe. I am therefore asking you to be particularly vigilant to ensure that our rights, which are increasingly threatened, remain the only things that govern our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if the European Union is to be credible, if it is itself to respect rights and be respected, it must put its own house in order and not be afraid to respond and take action when violations occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on what is a fundamental report of critical importance to the Union. The report merits careful consideration. As the rapporteur said, if the European Union is prepared to demand high standards in the human rights area, it should also be prepared to scrutinise its own performance and deliver high standards. Given the wide range and nature of the report, it is not possible to address all the concerns raised, but I will endeavour to address some of the key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks we have all been horrified by the tragic events in Madrid, and our deepest sympathies go to the victims, their families and all the people of Spain. As the Taoisech has already reported, a declaration on terrorism was adopted by the European Council and sets out a package of measures designed to enhance the capacity of the European Union to meet the threat of terrorism. We are also conscious of our obligations to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms when undertaking any counter-terrorism measures. There can be no compromise on these fundamental values; there is no trade-off. The effective suppression of terrorism necessitates respect for due processes and for the rule of law. The Declaration commits us to combating terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also agreed that negotiations on the new Constitution should be resumed. As the Members of this House will be aware, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was discussed extensively at the European Convention, and on which there was an overwhelming consensus, is an element to be incorporated in the new Constitutional Treaty – something that we will all welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere European Council in 1999 agreed to work towards the creation of a common European Union asylum system on the basis of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention. We welcome the progress made yesterday in the Justice and Home Affairs Council on the Asylum Qualifications Directive. Our priority is to finalise this and to reach agreement on the Procedures Directive as part of the completion of the first phase of the Common European Asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to another issue, trafficking in human beings is an appalling, exploitative and criminal practice. The Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, endorsed by the Council last May, provides the basis for a comprehensive five-year programme, which we are actively working towards. The Council has also agreed measures to give assistance to victims of trafficking through the provision of short-term residence permits to victims who cooperate with the competent authorities. In this context I recall the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which was adopted last year and which is all part of the human rights defence spectrum.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the issue of solidarity and social exclusion, Member States have adopted national action plans in the context of the Lisbon Agenda, outlining the actions to be taken to combat social exclusion. The second such plan was developed in all Member States last year, following a consultation process with social cohesion interest groups. The European Council agreed that a high level of social cohesion was central to the Lisbon Agenda and that strategies which make a decisive impact on social exclusion and on the eradication of poverty should be reinforced. It focused particularly on the key role that could be played by the modernisation of social protection systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We see employment as the primary route out of poverty and out of social exclusion; employment in well-paid jobs, enabling citizens to enjoy higher levels of prosperity throughout the Union. The European Council recognised that delivering more and better jobs was the most urgent issue to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to attract more people into the labour force. Achieving higher rates of labour force participation by women and older groups should assist in combating social exclusion and in averting the continuing higher risk of poverty experienced by these groups. It is also in the interest of the Community to do this in any event.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to equality issues which were addressed in the report, the overall effect of the three European Union equality directives is to require Member States to prohibit direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment on the grounds of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in relation to employment, self-employment or occupational and vocational training. Victimisation is also prohibited. It is important now that we move ahead to fully implement these vital protections for some of the more vulnerable groups in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">Making progress on the draft directive on equality of access to the supply of goods and services has been identified as an important priority of the Irish presidency and has an impact in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The representatives of the Member States meeting within the European Council in Brussels on 13 December 2003 noted the importance of human rights data collection and analysis to assist in policy formation. They agreed to extend the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to become a Human Rights Agency, and the Commission is preparing a proposal to give effect to the European Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">On free movement within the Union, I would like to record the adoption of the directive on long-term resident status for third country nationals. This opens the possibility to access long-term resident status after five years of legal residency and the recognition of equality of treatment in a series of aspects of social and economic life. Given some of the wilder statements in some of the media referred to by the rapporteur about issues relating to free movement, this is a very welcome development. On a personal note I would like to mention in particular that there is a reference in paragraph 155 to judicial delays. I have to say to the rapporteur that I was most impressed by the fact that an Irish case is cited there. It is a case in which I myself was involved and the delays there were, in my view, unforgivable.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted with interest the question of participation in European and local elections and the democratic deficit. As we approach the European elections, it is in all of our interests to encourage and to ensure the highest possible turnout of all eligible voters. Participation is at the very heart of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it is clear from public opinion surveys, poor voter turnout in European Union elections and media reporting that many Europeans feel disconnected from the European Union and consider that they are not sufficiently informed about the EU. For this reason the presidency has decided to convene a Ministerial Conference on Communicating Europe which takes place next week. The Conference will have two key objectives: to discuss how people might be better informed about the European Union and to assess how we might promote greater engagement by all Europeans in deciding how our Union develops and moves ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in this debate and, on a personal level, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what I regard as a very fine and an extremely significant report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, this document is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, although the rapporteur has chosen a subject-based overview of the Charter, analysing the criminalisation of vulnerable social movements and groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the fight against terrorism, which is, unfortunately, a highly topical subject again, and one that affects us all deeply, we must ensure that fundamental rights and public freedoms are respected. I can assure you that I cherish this principle and I hope that after the tragic events of 11 March in Madrid we shall be able to overcome some of the difficulties encountered in the past and adopt legal rules for the protection of individuals, including the common procedural guarantees in the matter of criminal procedure that are essential for building mutual trust and applying the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. The measures taken to protect democracy and the rule of law in Europe against all forms of crime and against terrorism must strike a clear balance between the protection of fundamental rights – especially the rights to security and freedom, which are inseparable – on the one hand and social protection measures on the other. Clearly, the European Union has reached a very important juncture so far as the protection of fundamental rights is concerned. By enlarging, laying down its constitutional rules and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, it is about to define its true identity. Your report serves a very important purpose, namely to monitor the observance of fundamental rights by the Member States, which is very important in itself, and also by the European institutions. The report will also help to promote fundamental rights, and that is essential for the future. All of your recommendations to the Commission will be looked at very closely to ensure that they are acted upon in the most appropriate way. I shall now address a few points in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights has just completed its report for the year 2003. The Commission has just received the final version of this report, which will be forwarded to you officially as quickly as possible. I would like to emphasise that in response to Parliament’s request made last year, the Network has this year sent us the 25 national reports on which the summary report on the whole Network is based. Like the Network’s first report, the 2003 report, which expresses the views only of the Network of Independent Experts and not those of the Commission, focuses not only on a number of concerns relating to respect for fundamental rights but also, it must be said, on positive aspects, in particular the good practices developed by some Member States that might be the inspiration for similar solutions in others. The Network of Experts is anxious to preserve the link between the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is their benchmark, and the more general trends in international human rights law, in particular changes to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Network’s report covers an enormous range of issues. The Network stresses the contribution that the EU can make, in exercising its powers in criminal matters, towards safeguarding fundamental rights in several respects, for example in the fight against racism and xenophobia, the fight against trafficking in human beings or the fight against impunity for serious crimes under international law. The Network makes valuable comments on the development of asylum policy in the Member States and in the EU’s instruments. In this connection, Mr Roche has just pointed out that the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached agreement yesterday on a vital directive bringing the definition of refugee into line with the 1951 Geneva Convention, approximating the systems of subsidiary protection in all the Union’s Member States and covering the crucial and delicate question of persecution by non-State agents. The Network’s report also expresses concerns about the slowness with which European law is adapting to changes in the laws of some Member States concerning the definition of the family.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the question of the Human Rights Agency. As Mr Roche has just reminded us, the December European Council decided to extend the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to make it a Human Rights Agency. The creation of a Human Rights Agency has also been called for by this House, in Mrs Swiebel’s report on basic rights in the European Union in 2001, for example. The Commission had already begun to consider whether it was appropriate to create an agency of that kind. The idea was also put forward in the Commission communication on Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which we presented to Parliament last October. Around July, the Commission will be presenting a discussion paper so that the idea of setting up a Human Rights Agency can be the subject of a wide-ranging public debate. We believe the agency’s creation should be preceded by a wider debate on its aims and how it should operate. To allow the next Parliament to take part in the discussion, the dialogue with civil society will continue until October and will end with a Commission-organised public hearing, on the basis of which we intend submitting a draft regulation on the new agency in spring 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot commit myself on the substance of the regulation at present, but I can assure you that the agency’s creation will in no way compromise the study of racism and xenophobia; these will continue to be important pillars of the agency’s activities, and of its political visibility. It cannot be otherwise when fears of growing racism and xenophobia are again being felt in Europe, as evidenced by the Vienna Monitoring Centre’s work and, in particular its reports on anti-semitism, which will be presented to Parliament today. It is also clear that the agency’s creation must not be allowed to upset the existing institutional balance. Finally, we are not planning to extend the agency’s mandate beyond the territory of the European Union for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European policy on fundamental rights is taking shape. The year 2000 saw the proclamation of the Charter and, following the European Parliament’s recommendation, in 2002 we set up the Network of Experts, which I mentioned earlier. The entry into force of the Treaty of Nice was an important staging post for the application of Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty. The new constitutional treaty will make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding and will allow the Union to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication on Article 7, the Commission presented an outline analysis of the conditions for applying that article in the future, with the emphasis on prevention; this will involve, inter alia, cooperation between the institutions and with the Member Sates and dialogue with civil society. The future of European integration depends on the common values of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democratic institutions. All activities in the field of justice and internal affairs must be rooted in those common values.</p>
<p class="contents">Thought will have to be given to how the internal and external dimensions of human rights can be addressed coherently. I am firmly convinced that with the Constitution we are profoundly changing the Union’s legal and political environment. I hope that, together, the Commission and Parliament will be on the right road towards building a genuine fundamental rights policy within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should record that in many ways my party is not altogether happy with the Charter of Fundamental Rights as it came in and, especially in view of what we have heard from both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, we have concerns that it could become yet another framework for regulation and bureaucracy, when common sense and good manners should be allowed to have their individual way.</p>
<p class="contents">With the imminence of our elections, we are all aware that the largest party in Europe is now the apathy party. We are very conscious that the forecasts for turnout in June are going to be even lower than in the past. A major task facing the next Parliament will be to bring the citizens of the new Europe to a greater understanding of, and involvement with, the institutions. And they are <span class="italic">their</span> institutions, not <span class="italic">our</span> institutions. There are a number of methods by which citizens can make their voices heard. They can apply directly to their elected national governments, which make up the Council; to their Commissioner nominated by their elected government; to us, as elected representatives; to the European Ombudsman; and also to the Committee on Petitions of this Parliament. It is on behalf of that committee that I have submitted an opinion on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Petitions have noticed how often we are able to sort out things which should have been sorted out at a national, or even sometimes a regional, level. However, the continuing existence of the Committee on Petitions provides a very useful safety valve and stopgap, and, uniquely among Parliament's committees, its work will continue over the interregnum into the new Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you may have noticed that there is a work of art – I assume it is a work of art – in the centre of the tower building courtyard: a glass globe, approximately two metres in diameter. From a distance it seems simple and transparent, but the closer you get to it, the more complicated the construction appears and the more opaque the surface. This is a superb, but ironic, symbol of both this Parliament and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore suggest that it is the job of the new House and the new Commission to make the present institutions work and to simplify their relationships with citizens. This would do much to meet the objectives laid out by the President-in-Office and to ensure that we, when we are re-elected, have the support of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Misconduct on the part of government personnel and police officials, conditions in prisons, unequal treatment, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and particularly recently, the increasingly-threatened erosion of civil rights, such as the rights of suspects, the presumption of innocence, and last but not least, privacy – all of this under the guise of the fight against terrorism. Mrs Karamanou will say something more about this in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, these reports, and particularly the last one by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, prompt us to reconsider what should be the political response of the European institutions to all of this. That is why I am especially pleased that Minister Roche, present here on behalf of the Irish Presidency, has stated in no uncertain terms that the European Union must be prepared to search its own heart. I very much appreciate this statement. Other presidencies have avoided the issue or have failed to turn up at all to debates of this kind, and it appears to me that such honesty should be very much appreciated, so all honour to him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we should question whether the EU can, as yet, be considered to possess a fully-fledged human rights policy. The fact is that it does not. We are moving in the right direction, but what we have at the moment is fragments and building blocks all the same. In a relatively short space of time, over the past five years, important normative and institutional parameters have been moved. As various speakers have already pointed out, although changes have been made, all of these combined efforts still have not led to a coherent human rights policy. Allow me to outline the various points in the remaining time that is allocated to me.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have a Charter which explicitly states the human rights obligations of the Member States. That is truly wonderful.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have a European Parliament which uses this Charter as a basis for its reports. That too is commendable, because that makes the process systematic and verifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, there is a network, and that has not only made the reporting, but also the analysis and advice-giving much more professional. We should certainly continue down this road, for that is a major achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we have Article 7 of the Treaty, to which the Council in Nice added a warning mechanism. That too is enormous progress, because to put it bluntly, it takes more than an atom bomb to wage war.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we have received the Commission’s communication of October 2003, which fleshed out this revised Article 7. As a result, we know what the Commission thinks about how this should be handled, although we are still waiting for the Council’s opinion on this Commission communication. I assume that Parliament will be discussing it during the next session.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has already pointed out, the sixth building block we have is the Human Rights Agency. This is the outcome of a decision reached by the Council back in December. I am pleased that it has made a first step in the course of decision-making to be followed. I will contribute to this myself, as far as I am able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, this has also been mentioned, we will soon have a Constitution in which the article on values will be reinforced and in which the Charter will be included. That is all wonderful, but they are mere building blocks, and do not yet form a coherent whole.</p>
<p class="contents">What we really need is a coherent human rights policy covering all goals, institutions, instruments and finances. Moreover, I should very much like clarity in the question as to what extent the human rights problems in one Member State are actually an issue for the European Union as a whole, so that countries and Member States, and we too, dare to call each other to account much more honestly than we have done to date. Let me once again say how delighted I am with the contributions by Mr Roche, on behalf of the presidency, and by Commissioner Vitorino. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is the situation like in the EU-15, which is a Union founded on the equal value of all human beings, humanism, tolerance and human dignity? I should think that the vast majority of us in this House can see cracks in the EU façade. Welcome to our Union: refugees are insulted and excluded and run the risk of losing their lives on the way to a better life in Europe. An important step towards a common policy on refugees was taken yesterday, as the Minister said, but it has been a long time in coming, and the proposals do not go far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight hundred thousand women and children are bought and sold as commodities in a loathsome sex trade. Women suffer genital mutilation, risk being forced into marriage and suffer abuse daily just for being women. Freedom of the media and of expression are being reduced. Homosexuals suffer discrimination. Anti-semitism is on the increase, and Jews are hearing the same slogans that resounded through Europe in the 1930s. There is evidence of hatred and violence in the report being presented today. Racism and implacability towards immigrants are growing. Millions of immigrants are excluded from society. Muslims are being persecuted. Islamic fundamentalism is growing strong in the suburbs of our towns and cities. Indeed, it was in our Union that 190 ordinary Spaniards lost their lives on their way to work on an ordinary day.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true to say that freedom has never been stronger than this spring, when Europe is united and old wounds are healed. At the same time, however, we know that our EU-15 will bring many shortcomings along with it into the new EU on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that it is regrettable that virtually all Member States are introducing restrictions on the new Member States. European leaders should have been able to prevent this together by being better prepared and having adapted the acquis communautaire in time. Many of our new friends are justifiably disappointed by this. In conclusion, I should like to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party requests the support of the House for two amendments on the European arrest warrant and the French ban on headscarves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the recent meeting of justice and home affairs ministers and their messages, I would like to concentrate on the protection of refugees, that is on Article 18 (Right of asylum) and Article 19 (Protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, on which I sincerely congratulate the rapporteur, accuses the Member States of so far being unable to agree on a directive on asylum procedures and the status of refugees. This very week, the home affairs ministers have now agreed to this. It is good that the new directive will also give people who are fleeing their homelands because of persecution by non-state agents recognised status in all EU countries. That is something that I and many non-governmental organisations and citizens have worked for. At the behest of my government, unfortunately, refugees – but not victims of political persecution – are being disadvantaged when it comes to access to the employment market. I cannot see any objective reason for that and I also think it is counterproductive economically because refugees with so-called subsidiary protection will be forced to work illegally in order to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who preach about fundamental and human rights to the outside world must also look at their own performance and not be always looking only at ways their neighbours could improve. That is right and I am glad the President-in-Office also sees it that way.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s own record on migration and asylum is in my opinion downright shameful, as the report clearly shows. I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that people who have made their lives here in the European Union still do not have the right to vote, even though the European Parliament has called for it on many occasions. I also want to point out that the concept of a safe third country will make it virtually impossible for refugees to enter the European Union legally in future. The only way to get asylum here will be to jump out over Europe with a parachute. I would therefore like us in Europe to have the courage to make a change of policy so that we will not again have a report criticising the European Union for so many different serious violations of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel I must point something out: for years now this annual report has been getting more and more like a copy of itself. We see persistent infringements, always of the same rights; there is always the same debate, but we never get to the crucial point raised by Mrs Swiebel. Do the Commission and the Council really want respect for fundamental human rights to be a proper policy? We expect a reply to this. Should the reply be, however, that we already have Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, then you must understand right now that that is a false answer. Even though the conditions for implementing it exist, Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union has never been implemented and never will be in an institutional context in which the European Commission, for obvious reasons, will never have the strength to go against one of the Member States. Therefore, in view of the recurrent infringements denounced in these reports and in the absence of sanctions, it is inevitable that we shall yet again see this picture deteriorate even further next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called counter-terrorism initiatives should be added to all this. In recent times, the only practical consequence of all the initiatives taken by the Council, or which the Council would like to take, despite their stated purpose of fighting terrorism, has in fact been to repress citizen’s freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the only truly useful initiative, that of breathing life into a European intelligence agency, we have read the statements by the Italian Minister for Internal Affairs saying that that is not possible because each national agency is possessive about its own data. If this is how the European Union protects its citizens from the dangers of terrorism, how can it ever have the strength and the ability to protect its own citizens from the infringements committed against them by the Member States themselves? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to start by echoing the point made by Minister Roche in his introduction that it is to the European Union's enormous credit that we can produce this critical self-appraisal, this report on human rights within the EU. It is very easy to criticise other parts of the world; it is more difficult, and to our credit, that we are prepared to look within the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the governments working together to make a more democratic institution – not by any stretch of the imagination a super-state that needs to be feared, as we might read in the papers. As Commissioner Vitorino quite rightly said, there are many positive points that we can take on board from this; and we can build on good practice from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agreed both with him and with Minister Roche when they spoke of the need to develop a modern interpretation of the Geneva Convention on refugees. The situation today is different from the post-war era of 1951, but the challenges may be similar, even if the practicalities will be different. We all need to cooperate if we are to implement its principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing could be more important for an EU of 25 countries than to have a common European policy on immigration and, alongside but separate, a common European policy for asylum. The rapporteur has referred to the need for this and I commend her on her work. As she says, it must not be based on the lowest common denominator; rather, a system that will gain the most respect and be the least subject to criticism will be based on the highest possible standards, will respect families, and will respect human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be brief, I should like to confine myself to the worries associated with the ultra-security-conscious approach that has just been confirmed by the last European Council. Following the American model, this positioning is dangerous and menacing; more to the point, it does not get to the roots of terrorism. Under the guise of fighting this curse, the legislation piling up in each of our countries is already giving rise to new infringements of human rights. I am thinking, for example, of the so-called preventative measures concerning the issue of visas in Germany, of the measures authorising the quasi-deportation of twenty-six thousand people in the Netherlands, of the measures in France that have brought about an increase in expulsions of more than a third in comparison with the start of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The European position is getting further and further away from the universal principles of asylum and solidarity. Have not the Heads of State just flouted these principles by authorising de facto, as from 2005, the keeping of systematic records on all people living in Europe? The same attitude prevails in the draft directives aimed at harmonising asylum policy. Should we not therefore be worried, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has just made clear, about the concept of safe third countries to which refugees can be passed on without any certainty about their safety? Finally, the same can be said of the European charters, which our Parliament has fortunately just rejected. On the contrary, the future of human rights in Europe will involve a genuine policy of welcome, equality of rights, including the right for everyone to vote and to be elected in all elections, and complete respect for the freedom of expression, including freedom of association. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On every occasion, it is remarkable how each rapporteur manages to outshine their predecessors in criminalising millions of Europeans who are faced with the tragic effects of unbridled immigration. It will not do to blame the few politicians and governments who make timid attempts to do something about the huge implications of asylum abuse, for a lack of solidarity. It is intellectually unfair to systematically fling the reproach of racism and xenophobia in the face of politicians who believe that our densely populated societies can no longer deal with fresh waves of immigration without catastrophic social effects. Less than two weeks ago, young immigrant gangs caused senseless destruction to various private properties here in Strasbourg, and they have done the same thing every Christmas for years. Maybe some rapporteur might be able to include in their report on constitutional rights a paragraph on the rights – to physical integrity, safety and ownership – of the Europeans who live on the outskirts of our cities. It would be more useful than the umpteenth hollow and irrelevant document about how badly we as Europeans tend to treat our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santini (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is true that this report on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union is in danger of becoming almost a routine appointment. So as not to repeat what has already been said on other occasions or by other Members, I shall therefore focus my speech on three topics in particular. The first, inevitably, is the family. Speaking not only for myself but also on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I strongly reject paragraphs 102 and 103, which yet again call repeatedly for legal recognition of cohabiting couples, even same-sex ones. We also reject Amendment No 157, which adds to this demand the right even to be able to adopt children normally. It seems that some people will never learn the old lesson that on this issue it is pointless to attempt to go against the European Treaty, which clearly attributes to the Member States the power, the competence and the sovereignty to decide on this sensitive issue themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">A second topic that I should like to address is that of press freedom and pluralism, which only yesterday was the subject of a heated debate in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. Once again, in language quite unsuitable for this House, paragraph 63 says that in Italy the notion of pluralism is trampled underfoot with the greatest cynicism. Come on, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, that is a sentence for an electoral manifesto, not for a debate in the European Parliament! We therefore strongly reject Amendments Nos 84, 85 and 86, which reiterate this misunderstanding and in the end put Italy in the firing line all by itself, as if all media problems were concentrated in our country.</p>
<p class="contents">They start, it is true, with assumptions we can all share, such as the criteria of pluralism, freedom and access to the press for all, but then they reach conclusions so restricted to the individual case of Italy that they end up discrediting all their noble assumptions as well. You just have to read the report by Reporters Without Borders, who certainly did not get together within the Italian Prime Minister’s organisation but are, as you know, an organisation of left-wing journalists. They carried out some research in Italy in April 2003, which they later published, in which they arrive at very different conclusions from those that characterise yesterday’s unbelievable report from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with its even more unbelievable amendments. For example, there is a conflict of interests in Italy, it is true, but it is being resolved these days – I might say right now as we speak – in the Italian Parliament, the only forum where this issue can be discussed seriously. A reform bill is on the point of being passed, a reform that the Italian left never had the courage or even the ability to propose during their seven years in government.</p>
<p class="contents">Reporters Without Borders say that the press in Italy – I am quoting them directly: I am not making this up – is ‘free and pluralistic, although weakened by the hegemony of television’. In contrast to what happened yesterday in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, they do not talk about censorship or media tyranny. On the political orientation of television news broadcasts, both public and private, they write that they are ‘substantially balanced’; the only explicit criticism is the distancing from the screen of public figures like Mr Biagi, Mr Santoro and Mr Luttazzi, whom – I assure you if you do not know them – nobody in Italy misses, except perhaps the political bosses who pay them.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word, this time, after so many negatives, to recommend the adoption of Amendment No 199, tabled by Mr Borghezio and myself, on the compensation due to Italian military detainees for the forced labour they did in Germany between 1943 and 1945. Only the Italians have not been compensated. We call on Germany to compensate those Italian citizens who worked hard against their will in factories and labour camps, even though it is now really very late. I should like to tell Mr Schroeder to do so quickly, because the youngest of them is 80 years old, and 10% of them die each year that passes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the recent European Council, discussions and decisions unfortunately focused on the after-effects and failed to address the essence and causes of the new situation created by the war against democracy, as President Pat Cox called terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certain that the repressive measures being promoted not only fail to get to the root of the evil, the massive inequalities and discriminations in the modern world, but also threaten to sweep away fundamental freedoms and democratic rights, thereby strengthening the objectives of terrorism from another quarter. In other words, we are being driven with mathematical precision into a sorry situation, in which the protection of personal data will be non-existent and privacy will be permanently under the scrutiny of big brother. Terrorism is being used as an alibi to increase spending on security and convert modern democracies into autocratic police states in which every citizen is treated as a potential terrorist.</p>
<p class="contents">While all this is happening on the terrorist front, another terrible crime being committed on a daily basis against thousands of women and children in the form of a modern slave trade has recently been added to our political agenda. Fundamental rights and democratic freedoms in the European Union are indeed under serious threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When, however, I read about all these rights couched in long words, I am led to think about a Danish politician who, back home in our windswept country, got elected on a programme designed to give a boost to cycle paths. It is the same refrain that underlies this report, namely the notion that rights are derived from words. In fact, rights are derived from social practice, struggle and political activity.</p>
<p class="contents">What also strikes me in this report is a detail of the tribute paid to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I have nothing against rights – quite the contrary – but why was the European Union as such not allowed to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights? Its doing so would have achieved the same result. The reason is that there is another agenda whereby these rights are, to the very greatest degree, concerned with the actual process of integration, and it is this duplicity in the agenda that prompts me to make this observation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the Council and governments initiate more and more new surveillance programmes, plunging thousands of migrants into sheer despair with their Fortress Europe policy, leaving them stuck at borders, allowing them to drown at sea, and the few that make it are then interned in the EU only to be removed again as soon as possible, the European Parliament, which claims to be the guardian of fundamental and human rights, actually applauds. Unfortunately, the reality looks rather different to all those who are deprived of their most elementary civil rights. State, police and racist violence are everyday occurrences in the European Union’s capitalist society. The blatant justification of torture in Germany by numerous politicians and representatives of the judiciary and police in 2003 is a specific example of this. Unfortunately, when my draft resolution condemning this justification of torture was rejected in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this was brought about by those groups that are now defending their political friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I concur with the view put forward by many that our Union is rooted in a shared commitment to freedom, human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law. Our Union must be an exemplar in all of those areas, otherwise we are an exercise in hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned that in the Tampere programme the Council reaffirmed the importance that the Union and the Member States attach to the absolute right to seek asylum, mentioned by several Members. It agreed to work towards the establishment of a common European asylum system. That is very important and absolutely correct. Mr Evans, for example, said that the system we establish must have clarity. He is absolutely correct in that regard. Given the debate that has been raging in a number of Member States, I want to touch upon the issue of migration, an issue raised by a number of Members. There is a disturbing rise in xenophobic comment, particularly in some parts of the popular media. Europe is open to migration. Indeed migration into Europe is both necessary and desirable, along with migration within Europe. The development of a common EU migration policy is therefore of particular importance. Both Mr Evans and Ms Kaufmann touched upon this. It is important that we have a clear-cut policy on legal migration in order to help put an end to some of the disturbing hysteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish presidency will continue to support an initiative by the Commission to combat trafficking in human beings, especially bearing in mind the work of the expert group in this area and the Brussels Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite a number of speakers made reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the draft Constitutional Treaty. It strikes me that the Charter of Fundamental Rights elements in the draft Constitutional Treaty are one of the great pillars on which that Treaty is based. The Charter provides an additional safeguard for citizens of the Union in their dealings with the institutions of the Union or those of Member States when they apply Union law. I simply cannot understand how this can be portrayed as anything other than positive. I was therefore surprised by the contribution by the Earl of Stockton in this regard. I do not think it is correct to portray the Charter as a negative; it is positive in every regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The Earl of Stockton made the point that common sense and good manners are the best protection. Perhaps he would be right if we lived in an ideal world, but we do not. We live in a less than perfect world. My personal experience is that common sense and good manners have failed us on more than one occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members made reference to the importance of a free press in the protection of civil liberties. A free press is fundamental to the protection of civil liberties. The same Members, however, mentioned concerns about excessive concentration. Concentration is a fact of life right across the European Union, and to the extent that it interferes with the free exercise of comment or dulls the capacity of a free press to act as a protector of all our liberties, such concentration is a cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Members for the very interesting and stimulating debate. I also want to thank Members for the kind words they had to say about the Irish presidency. I can assure you that the presidency, in carrying forward the Council's work, will give careful consideration to the points that have been made today.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on this report. We may not agree with every single word and every comment in the report, but it is incredibly important that we hold a mirror up to ourselves from time to time to see if we can meet our own high standards. This report certainly helps in that regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel, however, that for Members of this House, who are soon to go before the electorate in elections that are especially important for the EU’s future, it is worth recalling that the extraordinary<span class="italic"> </span>gains of the past five years in the area of human rights are something to be proud of and may, indeed, encourage the citizens to take part in the electoral process, given the prospects for establishing a European policy on fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention that approved the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament’s annual role in identifying problems in fundamental rights – sometimes a highly ideological debate, but certainly always a topical one – the amendment of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice, the fact that a Fundamental Rights Agency has been established and, as the President-in-Office of the Council Mr Roche has just said, the prospect of giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights a central role in the draft Constitutional Treaty, constitute, in my view, a range of aspects that will show the citizens that this body, which they elect directly, has always placed the issue of fundamental rights at the forefront of political debate and activity.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation concerns the references made to asylum policy. We cannot hide the fact that Member States have differences that are sometimes difficult to surmount, and that sometimes the price we have to pay to get over these differences is an agreement based on the lowest common denominator. We have always viewed such agreements as one part of a gradual definition of asylum policy and migration. We cannot close our eyes to this, but let us not be defeatist. Today, I must confess – and it pains me to say this – the day after the Council of Ministers finally adopted a directive defining the concept of refugee, aligning systems of subsidiary protection and recognising that non-State agents can be agents of persecution, in which case refugee status can also be granted; we welcome this directive, which contains excellent proposals in the area of international protection and is a major step forward in defining a European concept of asylum. Let us, today at least, not be defeatist and let us recognise the positive elements of the steps that have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment concerns the protection of privacy and fundamental rights in the war on terror. We are not in the process of creating an Orwellian world. It cannot be denied that we face a threat and in order to protect our open way of life we must prevent terrorism and protect our citizens. To this end, we must make use of the technology that proves to be the most appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not tilt at windmills, nor must we fight technology merely for the sake of it. What we must do is ensure that this technology is used in accordance with the law and the required safeguards as regards privacy and guarantees of fundamental rights. This is the challenge facing us, and Parliament must, accordingly, be involved in defining the legal rules governing the introduction of biometric data on passports and visas, and of data cross-checking in the area of security.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the key frame of reference of the policy of protecting fundamental rights in the EU is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but is not solely confined to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We do not wish to be cut off from the general development of the protection of fundamental rights across Europe as a whole, notably in the scope of the Council. There is, therefore, no conflict between conferring constitutional status on the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights and at the same time advocating that the EU should join the European Convention on Human Rights. The future European Constitution points in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
