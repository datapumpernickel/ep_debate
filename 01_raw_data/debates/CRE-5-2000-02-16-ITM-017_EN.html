It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency. How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs? We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited. The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced. It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions. This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place. Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament’s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March. </p>
<p class="contents">Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay. A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself. </p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation. The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which <span class="italic">will be</span> in circulation. It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries. The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience. These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years’ imprisonment. Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences. Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty. </p>
<p class="contents">The denominations of the euro are well known. Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves. Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime. There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage. The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations. </p>
<p class="contents">It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal. It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March. To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible. It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes. In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency. The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight. The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others. The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision. </p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for listening. Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter’s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world’s most important reserve currencies. Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery. This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective. It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation. This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment. I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time. We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All that is indeed very true and correct. It is easy to counterfeit the euro. We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history. It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a highly complex problem. If we do not act promptly – as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said – anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation. Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the European Union doing about it? It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy. We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success – I will come to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months. It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament’s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us. So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this. We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress. Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited. One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation. That is why, and I quote, this framework decision “is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol”, i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old. That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation. Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters. The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article. So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect. That is what I would have preferred, personally. But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision. Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro – so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty. However, I find these passports inadequate. Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking. Counterfeiting is not on the list. Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union. So we come back to the previous problem. In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis. In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a more general point. Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session. But there has been nothing for a year. Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting. The Commission’s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved. Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros? Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money. These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern. Criminal law is part of each individual nation’s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts. I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld’s work, and my point of departure will be her search – in connection with the Tampere Summit – for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied. She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction. In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission’s and the Council’s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate? In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation. What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States’ obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation. In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis. I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting – and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made. We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it. So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned with the question of cooperation. We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro. I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work. In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved. I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, after all, a question the people often ask. And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets. For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting. That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used. Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency. They will need time to get used to that too.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting. And that is what we are discussing at this late hour. This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour. But that cannot be helped.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time. After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting. As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training – an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law. That is what this framework decision is about.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time. I certainly appreciate that.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences. Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament’s prompt decision – and I hope the vote will be in favour – means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it. For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law. In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step. In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future. The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol. That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance. As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million. That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
