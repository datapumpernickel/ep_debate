<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diana Wallis (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present our interim report and I would like to thank our secretariat, the Chairman of our committee and the members for their support and work. The starting point for this report has been a disastrous personal event for thousands of EU citizens: the loss of their pension investments. The challenge now for us as the European Parliament is to exercise our supervisory powers over EU legislation. We have perhaps a once-in-a-generation chance to look in detail at the implementation process of EU law, taking one particular directive as an example. Did we the institutions get it right? Did the Member States get it right? How can we do better in the future? This fits well with our wider, better legislation agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In presenting the interim report, first let me deal with two items regarding the process: one general and one particular. This is the first such committee of inquiry in ten years. Each time we have the chance to learn how to do this better in future, to build our own institutional knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, as always, been asked to produce an interim report but, to report properly we need all the evidence, all the studies, all the answers to our inquiries to be available. Having to produce an interim report as a matter of form is something of a distraction, although of course we like to keep our colleagues informed as to where we are. Maybe we can think about this question for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the particular aspect. Our inquiry is about the EU aspects of this case. Others have already made extensive inquiries in the UK and another, even more in-depth inquiry is due from the British Parliamentary Ombudsman in November 2006. It would be foolish for us to publish our report in advance of the information that report is likely to contain. The UK Ombudsman has had substantial access to many UK actors in this drama. It makes no sense for us to repeat the exercise, but equally it would make no sense for us not to take account of these findings. Hence we will need a little more time. This is foreseen in the report and we will ask the House to endorse our request for probably a couple more months to produce our final report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me come to the ground that we have covered. This is set out mainly in the annex to the report. We have set up our working method, which involves a number of comparative studies; these have been commissioned. We have already heard a wealth of evidence, most importantly from many of the victims. Their stories have been heartrending. They have made me angry – angry that they have been let down by their experience of our internal market for financial services. For them it has not produced extra choice, but rather the loss of life savings with no redress mechanisms available.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learnt more details about the Commission’s implementation checks – or rather I should say checklist. Maybe we need to look for more checks in the future. We have seen the difficulty of inserting EU legislation into the existing fabric of Member States’ legal and regulatory systems. It does not always fit. We have seen that we can raise undue expectations by what is written in EU law particularly, in this instance, about the availability of compensatory mechanisms. When it gets to Member-State level, maybe something gets lost in translation.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the big missing part of the jigsaw: access to justice. Where is this in a country-of-origin regime? Let this be the real lesson to all of us. In this inquiry we have heard from victims sent from pillar to post. The Commission has now admitted, in a note to us on home and host country authorities, that this does not work. Let me read: ‘The directive can only work smoothly if there is good cooperation between home and host state authorities. It is not a satisfactory situation, where aggrieved policyholders are referred by the host state authority to the home state authority and are then sent back by the home to the host authority, thus to find themselves unable to have their case examined by either. The Commission plans to seek further discussions with Member States.’ I should jolly well hope so! If this inquiry does nothing else, I hope that we can put this injustice right.</p>
<p class="contents">That is an indication of where we have got to as of now; there will be much more to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The interim report under discussion today provides a useful summary of the committee’s mandate and programme of work. As the report says, it is too early to draw conclusions. The committee continues to collect evidence. We all await with interest the second report of the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, from the start, declared its readiness to cooperate fully with the Committee of Inquiry. We have provided all the documentation and information requested by the committee and will continue to provide whatever support we can. I will be more than happy to appear before the committee in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The Equitable Life affair has caused much anguish and financial loss for many citizens and we must draw appropriate lessons for the future. In that context, our ongoing Solvency II insurance project is aimed at contributing to the financial strength of all EU insurance undertakings. Solvency II intends to enhance policyholder protection and to overhaul and deepen EU regulation and supervision in the insurance area. Risk-oriented calculations of the solvency requirements of insurance undertakings would be introduced. Under Solvency II, the calculation of insurance liabilities will be harmonised and convergence of supervisory practices will be fostered.</p>

That means that I often find myself caught between the two of them, but the work they have done is excellent and what Ms Wallis has spoken about today proves that point.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had several meetings at which many organisations and individuals have presented evidence that confirms me in my judgement that this special committee was very necessary. We have been much impressed, angered and even moved by those speaking to us and the financial and emotional losses they are experiencing. We have also heard from some of those who are responsible for regulation. So far, I do not think there is any evidence of negligence or criminal activity, but I would characterise their behaviour so far as benign complacency.</p>
<p class="contents">There are as yet no firm conclusions, but one loophole has been exposed. If a German or an Irishman buys a policy from a British company, it is the British regulator who is responsible for the financial probity of that company. The German or Irish regulators appear to play no role, but that does not help the EU citizen, for whom it is impractical, inconvenient and costly to pursue concerns with the British regulator, even supposing he were interested.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to address this. We continue our investigation, but we have no magic wand to restore the fortunes of the aggrieved policyholders. As Ms Wallis said, we must close the loopholes, learn from what has gone before and improve the position next time, especially as it relates to the activities of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the extraordinary aspects of this issue is the fact that those outside the UK who purchased policies from Equitable Life did so believing that they had European Union protection and that the regulators in their own country would protect them. They then discovered some years ago that, in fact, they have no protection whatsoever. When the 8300 investors in Ireland, who were putting money aside for their pensions, and about 4000 such investors in Germany went to their respective regulators, they were told to go and talk to the UK regulator. This is not the way that people expected to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">This report highlights another important aspect: the manner in which this has come to the House through the Committee on Petitions. That committee is one of the most effective ways of bringing Europe close to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner and others have said that it is too early yet to draw conclusions. However, one of the conclusions I have come to is that we need to look closely at the manner in which financial services are regulated, because it would appear that we expect a regulator to do two functions which are distinctly different. One is to protect the stability of the financial services market, and the other is to protect the interests of the investor. At one level it may be that this is possible, because clearly an investor in pension funds is interested in having a stable market. However, when it comes to the crunch – when a treasury may face large claims – does the regulator protect the market or protect the investor? In this particular instance the UK Treasury was directly responsible for regulating Equitable Life and it would have been faced with claims for billions of pounds sterling had it found that Equitable Life should close down. It did not choose to do so. I would argue that we need to look closely in Solvency II at what regulators are expected to do and separate out those two functions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that it is too early to draw conclusions; however, I would like to make a few observations.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is about solvency. Whether or not the company should be considered to have been solvent during the time leading up to the crisis has several consequences. That affects the policyholders’ possibilities of defending their rights and interests, but it also has an impact upon the responsibility of the UK authorities and, possibly, the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK authorities strongly emphasised that Equitable Life had never had any problems with solvency and always complied with EU law. The UK authorities also indicated that there are a number of different ways of valuing assurance companies. If there are several ways of calculating solvency, how is it possible to make a proper analysis?</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the directive seeks to ensure that an assurance company is not managed in such a manner that it may jeopardise the undertaking’s solvency in the long term. It is also clear that the directive obliges Member States to take such measures with regard to the undertaking, its directors or managers, or the persons who control as are appropriate and necessary in order to prevent or remedy any irregularities prejudicial to the interests of the assured persons.</p>
<p class="contents">I doubt whether this has happened. The fact that the UK authorities always considered Equitable Life solvent also had repercussions on customers and authorities in other Member States. It appears that both customers and authorities in Ireland and Germany were taken by surprise when the crisis broke out.</p>
<p class="contents">Another observation I have, which concerns the country of origin principle, is the question of monitoring and provision of information. The UK authorities, who were responsible for monitoring the activities of the company in other Member States too, never informed those Member States that there was a problem. Maybe it was because they did not want to recognise this. Frankly, in hindsight, it does not look as if the supervision has worked.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem with the home country of origin rule is the lack of redress for consumers, who have been sent back and forth by the national authorities. Consumers who trusted that the European Union would guarantee them an equivalent position and safeguards if they bought assurance on the internal market as they would if they had bought on the national market found themselves in a situation where nobody would accept responsibility for their efforts to obtain damages for their losses.</p>
<p class="contents">From a consumer point of view, the home country of origin principle turned out to be a real ping-pong game. There seems to be a large vacuum in EU legislation here. The EU should take more measures to protect individual citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard a whole series of reports prepared by Mrs Wallis which have been characterised by outstandingly precise legal language and a brilliantly clear description of the facts. Mrs Wallis is also a member of the Committee on Petitions. I have the honour and pleasure of working with her on that committee and I always regard her work with great respect. This also applies to the report we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Equitable Life was first sent to the Committee on Petitions. The committee is very pleased that the case is being discussed at a plenary session of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Insurance matters are incredibly sensitive issues. We all remember well the Lloyds case which we recently looked into. These are cases which are damaging to large numbers of people, in this case the many thousands of people who trusted the insurance company Equitable Life with their future. Just when they reach old age it turns out that they have been left without means and a great injustice has been committed against them. We must look into the matter very carefully but there is also another matter related to this case and that is the effectiveness of our actions. Mrs Wallis very aptly said that it is not simply a matter of implementing or adopting the directive but a matter of both implementing the directive and involving everyone who is affected by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Therein lies the problem which we often face, namely that decisions of the European Parliament as well as those of other European bodies are sometimes not as effective as they should be. It should be important to us, when Parliament adopts a certain position, for that position on the matter (at the moment I am thinking of the insurance cases, and the Equitable Life case in particular) to be enforced in its entirety, so that it does not merely end with a Parliament decision or a Parliament resolution. It must end with the making good of the damage done to a very large number of people, and the effectiveness of our work is incredibly important here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallis proposed in her report that our House should address this matter and adopt a position which would facilitate the work of the committee in the future. I strongly appeal for all the suggestions put forward by Mrs Wallis in her report on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry to be supported by the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Wallis and I hope that a satisfactory conclusion will be found to this matter as well as for those people who have suffered damages as a result of the Equitable Life case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise one or two things that have been said and look at them from a slightly different perspective. There are a number of practical issues that Ms Wallis touched on, as indeed did Sir Robert Atkins. The reality is that we have had many potential witnesses on our list; we have heard a few; and there are a great many more that we need to hear if we can. That includes many of the most important witnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Another practical problem is that too many of these witnesses have come forward at the same meeting, so there has been very little time to interrogate them. There has been no real cross-examination; they are not under oath; we have not been able to subpoena them; and there is the practical problem that flows from the inevitable requirement of interpretation. Taken together those are fairly serious weaknesses, although the committee is collectively doing its very best to overcome them.</p>
<p class="contents">To give you an illustration of what I am talking about, the British Government turned up en masse. A spokesman for the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary all arrived together, clearly having rehearsed their parts to the nth degree. They hunted as a pack, they stood together and we were unable to prise them apart or to check facts because they had come to admit nothing and to concede nothing. Even their answers to specific questions were evasive. To give you one vivid illustration, they denied that the Government or the equivalent department had any knowledge of problems with Equitable Life ten years before we knew – and we have proof that they did.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the point about shared management, which has been raised by others, it seems to me that, in this case, shared management is turning out to be no management at all. The Irish thought that the British Government was checking on Equitable Life. If they were, they were saying nothing. So, the Irish were kept in ignorance.</p>
<p class="contents">If today, for example, a Latvian financial services company started conducting business all over the European Union, it seems each Member State would assume that the Latvian Government was itself satisfied, but that would not necessarily be the case. This is not a reflection on Latvia, just an example. However, if that company was outside the European Union, every Member State would check thoroughly. That is a problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would urge the members of the committee to sharpen their interrogating skills and we will get answers, because that is a priority. I would say to my eloquent friend, Sir Robert Atkins, that, whilst he described me and the rapporteur as roses, we intend rather to be thorns in the side of the system, because there is something rotten here. People have been badly burnt and the system has failed them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard from all the petitioners of the disasters suffered by individuals. I agree with the rapporteur that this interim report is something of a distraction, but an important one just the same, because it will awaken Members of this House to the importance of detail. We vote here, we go home and we forget that in a couple of years the votes we take here are implemented in Member States. Sometimes we get it wrong as legislators and I think Equitable Life might yet prove that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not reached any conclusions yet, but one thing we have established is that the regulators were playing games of ping-pong with policyholders. It is important to thrash out the rights of the host country and the obligations of the home country.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is a key question to be answered. Some say they know the answer, but I have not come to any conclusion. Who knew of the difficulties in Equitable Life and when? Were others notified? In other words, were Member States’ regulators in other countries informed as soon as possible? Is it not the case that the directives, as they are implemented, would not allow a regulator to reveal confidential information that might dissuade a policyholder from investing in companies with problems like Equitable? That is a key question.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the work we are doing today, there is no doubt that Equitable has left a sour taste for the losers and others who are watching events unfolding and it does nothing to help those who are trying to encourage citizens to invest in pensions. What we find out from our investigation will be key for the future. Everyone tells us that with Solvency II life will be great in the future, but it will not be unless we get the regulations right.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, you can have all the regulation in the world, but if there is not a committed individual watching and guiding for all the Member States, it will amount to nothing. Finally, who is regulating the regulators? Is it the Commission? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Investigations into the Equitable Life Assurance Society are becoming more and more painstaking, and the deeper we delve, the more we are compelled to recognise what a tangled web of events we are actually examining and how much has actually gone wrong at all sorts of levels.</p>
<p class="contents">With our resolution today we will reaffirm that governments, parliaments and the responsible authorities in the Member States, and particularly in the United Kingdom, must do more to assist the committee of inquiry in the fulfilment of its mandate, for the principle of cooperation in good faith which is enshrined in the Treaties must be upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee of inquiry has explicit powers to request documents and to summon and question witnesses, but it is also entitled to have its questions answered. The answers given by people in positions of responsibility at the committee’s hearings, however, have been far from satisfactory. To be precise, this applies to the answers given by both the British Financial Services Authority and the Commission. The fact is that, in the case of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, no one either feels responsible or wants to accept responsibility, and the policyholders are left hanging.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine policyholders in Cologne or in Galway trying in vain to obtain information. From one month to the next they are being strung along. If it comes to the point that even a committee of inquiry is being fobbed off with politically correct and legally safe answers, how much worse must it be for the woman in Cologne or the man in Galway who, as a policyholder, is personally affected, whose money is at risk, who is perhaps approaching retirement age and now has to scramble after his or her pension.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things we can and must do: firstly, we must make the best possible use of the mandate given to us in the committee of inquiry to establish clarity, so that policyholders are finally shown where the faults and weaknesses lie. Secondly, all of us, and especially the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, must endeavour to ensure that the Solvency II project provides greater security in future for all concerned, so that we no longer need a committee of inquiry to discover whether the fault lies in European legislation, in the way it has been transposed by a Member State or in a company’s mismanagement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to the very technical nature of the European Parliament’s investigations into this issue, this Committee of Inquiry is going to take a lot more time to complete its work. This is a very serious business for the European Parliament. We should recall that, from an Irish perspective alone, over 6500 Irish citizens lost their pension investments either in total or in part as a result of the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this day and age, when there is so much EU regulation concerning the governance of financial investments, this is simply an intolerable and unacceptable situation. It is not, as Mr Mote said, that the Irish were kept in ignorance: they were treated differently. I say that it is intolerable and unacceptable for any company, financial or otherwise, to treat its policyholders differently. They should be treated the same, whether they are British, Irish or German.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has already invited a number of key witnesses to the European Parliament, including from the following categories: pensioners’ groups, the Equitable Life Members’ Action Group; British and Irish policyholders, representatives of the Equitable Life Assurance company; and representatives from the Financial Affairs Directorate at the European Commission. The committee is going to have to invite more witnesses if it is to get down to the nuts and bolts of how the UK life assurance market has operated in recent years. The committee is also going to need more time to carry out a comprehensive, comparative analysis into the operation of similar life assurance markets in Germany and in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is carrying out a very serious inquiry and the Committee of Inquiry is going to need more time to complete its work.

<p class="contents">Equitable Life is the world’s oldest assurance company; right up to the end of 1999, even Westminster MPs’ pension funds were still being invested in the company. Thousands of investors have lost money because of the cost of over-bonusing ‘with-profit’ life assurance policies. Many assurance companies offer with-profit policies – I have several such policies myself – but provided the company does not pay out more bonuses than it can afford the system works perfectly well. In my opinion, from the mid 1990s until 2000 the Equitable Life Assurance Society over-bonused its with-profit policies, which showed on paper at least that Equitable Life had the best results of all major assurance companies, thus encouraging people to take Equitable Life policies out.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that the cost in real terms of overvaluing the policies meant that Equitable Life paid out nearly GBP 6 billion more than it earned between 1997 and 2000. No assurance company, however large, can afford such sums.</p>
<p class="contents">From the information and evidence collected for the committee, it all seems very convenient that so many people carrying out the checks and balances of the company came very late to the party: i.e., the present board of management took over in 2000 after the company had all but ceased taking on new business; the Financial Services Authority was not created until late 1999, so it is not responsible for what happened before it came into existence; the financial actuaries advising the UK Government before the FSA was formed maintain that Equitable Life was always solvent, although one actuary giving evidence to our inquiry did admit there are up to six ways of valuing an insurance company.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has heard from many people who invested in Equitable Life and who have lost a great deal of money, which has caused them great hardship. The committee will carry on its work and we are determined to find out what went wrong with Equitable Life so that these problems do not happen in the future. We will try to get the best deal for those who have Equitable Life policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any event, a parliamentary committee of inquiry is not a court of justice. In other words, this committee is not going to be able to decide whether the British authorities have behaved correctly or incorrectly in their regulation of this field; that is a job for the courts of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">What are being exposed at the moment are shortcomings in the European Union’s rules, since they are intended to make it possible for activities of this kind to be carried out across national borders. What we are detecting at the moment is that there is no control mechanism for activities crossing national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As the representative of the Commission has said, each national authority is theoretically responsible for supervision, but, when the company collapsed, neither the Irish authorities nor the German authorities were able to do anything, because the company’s subsidiaries and branches in their respective countries were closed at that point. The 6 500 pensioners that Mr Ó Neachtain was talking about, in Ireland, and the thousands of pensioners in Germany, did not therefore have any opportunity to exercise control.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, a parliamentary committee is not a court of justice, but it can draw conclusions from a legislative point of view. I believe that the lesson we can now draw in this sense is that, at the moment, the principle of mutual recognition, the so-called ‘Community passport’, is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">When laying down Community rules, an effective control mechanism must also be established, which, eliminating the principle of country of origin or country of provenance, makes it possible for the European Union institutions to monitor the operations of institutions operating across national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that that is the most important conclusion we can draw so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also agree with her on the points that must be examined in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The exercise the Committee of Inquiry is engaged in is not an easy one. It needs first of all to look for the causes of the situation in which Equitable Life policyholders find themselves. In this regard, everything that the motion for a European Parliament resolution asks for and requires must be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Much is at stake, and the limits of the exercise need to be all the clearer because of that. As the previous speaker said, we must not lose sight of the fact that this is a parliamentary Committee of Inquiry. It is not a court of law able to hand down decisions on penalties or compensation. The information collected will, at the most, be useful for defending the victims’ interests, furnishing them with evidence that may be used in any proceedings they may take.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the results of the investigations may make a crucial contribution to the development of European regulation. They may reveal the inadequacies of the rules laid down or the failings in how they are applied. There will, no doubt, be more general lessons to be drawn by Parliament itself, by the Member States and by the Commission when it comes to regulating and monitoring the decisions that are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The work that has begun must therefore be continued accurately, determinedly and dispassionately, and with no ambiguity as to the expected outcome, lest undue expectations again be raised for the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I commend Mrs Wallis’s report. It is a very thorough interim report. I particularly welcome the request that we delay for three months. It is vital that we do not rush to judgment and that we await the outcome of the inquiries that are being undertaken in the United Kingdom. Of course we must look at the causes of this situation and the crisis that occurred, and particularly at the application of Community law. In that respect I am pleased to be speaking before Commissioner McCreevy. I look forward to what he has to say.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital, as I have said, that we do not rush to make a judgement. The witnesses have been extremely forthcoming and cooperative with the Committee of Inquiry. Uppermost in our minds, as the former speaker said, is that we have some recourse to justice, but we must certainly ensure that another Equitable Life crisis never happens again. Those people did what, arguably, we ask all good citizens to do: provide for their retirement, their future. They did so in what should be arguably one of the safest investment pots in any investment industry. It failed to be so, on the evidence that we have before us.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission looks forward to continuing working with the Committee of Inquiry. The aim is to see how we can ensure that Community and national law is properly implemented and applied. The single market offers advantages for consumers. Policyholders should be able to rely on their financial institutions and the fact that their solvency is ensured. We must ensure that consumers have viable means of redress. I look forward to the committee’s recommendations on the problems experienced by policyholders in various Member States and how they could be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would not accept that the Equitable Life affair calls into question the basis of internal market in the insurance sector. As Lord Penrose stated in his report on the affair, the origins of this crisis go back many years. National supervision is constantly developing and improving, whilst at European level the Solvency II project will provide a more coordinated and risk-based system. But no system can be guaranteed to prevent all market problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should avoid a more or less useless debate on host versus home state control. Host state control would not have made a difference in this case. In a single market, supervisors should cooperate. Both supervisors have roles to play. However, I certainly agree that we should not and cannot accept a ‘passing the buck’ attitude. That is definitely something that we need to address. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the growing crisis was concealed from policyholders. What is worse, new policyholders were solicited and presented with a false impression of a company with a secure future in which their funds would prosper. The regulators failed.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, Equitable Life lost a case in the UK that made it impose exit penalties on UK policyholders, though money for Irish policyholders was supposed to be ring-fenced and safe. Despite this, two years later in 2003, exit penalties worth about 20% of the value of Equitable Life policies were imposed on Irish policyholders. The regulators failed.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this time Irish Equitable Life policyholders have lost their investment, which in many cases means their life savings. They have been denied justice by the UK, Irish and EU authorities though they are entitled to redress and protection when regulators fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Their case has been before this Parliament’s Committee on Petitions for a year and a half. It is time for this Parliament to stand by the victims of failed regulatory mechanisms and to insist that an equitable settlement be finalised for the policyholders of Equitable Life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
