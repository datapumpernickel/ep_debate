<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haug (PSE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting down to serious business now, for this is about our money, or the European Union’s revenue to be precise. The discussions we are having today on reforming the system of own resources are directly related to the discussions we had and the decisions we reached in the spring of this year. I would like to draw your attention to the Commission’s comprehensive report, which presents a thorough analysis of own resources and has presented many of the options for reform which come up in discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">We established our position on the own resource system, as a Parliament in March, with full knowledge of this report and following very full discussions. Unfortunately, the Berlin Council was unable to reach agreement on an actual reform step but contented itself with the kind of haggling for which it has long been famed. The outcome of the Berlin conclusions has been further complication of the own resources system and restriction of the European Union’s financial room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation cannot be allowed to continue. We must put an end to the situation in which each Head of Government and Finance Minister in the Council only has the short-term interests of their own country at heart when it comes to planning our revenue, regardless of the consequences. This Community can only be sustained and developed if our common interests as a whole and our longer-term aspirations are taken account of, and if we are prepared to invest in this. In this connection, it is the Council’s policy in particular that merits condemnation, for it persists in committing expenditure at international donor conferences, the burden of which falls to the European budget, without ensuring that the corresponding revenue is in place. That being the case, the Council is not taking its dealings with the European Union’s revenue very seriously – and that is putting it mildly – and it may, in the forthcoming enlargement process, become a real handicap capable of obstructing our opportunities for development.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am also disappointed with the proposal put forward by the Commission on changing the own resource system. Of course, we are not under any illusions; we too are aware that the Council was not about to perform a dramatic about-turn at some point from the spring onwards, and initiate far-reaching reform. Obviously, I recognise that where our proposals are concerned, the Commission, as must we as a Parliament, has to take into account the mood in the Council and the positions adopted there if we want to achieve a workable outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission could have done more, in fact I would go so far as to say that it should have done more. It has trailed snail-like behind the Council, only to now place before us as a proposal something that follows the Council’s agreement to the letter. But it is also the role of the Commission to be the driving force of integration; at the very least, it must fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties, warding off any regulations which could damage the Community. In my view, it has failed to do so in the case of the present proposal. However, I would not want to spare us as a Parliament a certain amount of self-criticism either. We too could have been more courageous in our demands in respect of reform of the own resources system, and ought to have paid less attention to the discussions taking place at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">At all events, we are going to have to be more consistent in the next round of reforms – which ought not to be too long in coming – if we want to ensure that the Union still has the financial power to act after enlargement and once it has additional tasks. That is why we want to commit the Commission to making the schedule tighter than it envisaged doing in its report. Allow me to make clear in a few points the work that we can and must get under way if we are to change the own resource system in such a way that it will also be possible for there to be progress towards reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, planning the European Union’s revenue must be undertaken in accordance with a number of fundamental principles, without which the system would be unable to function indefinitely. This means that we need a system that is transparent, uniform and balanced. In the long-term there must be a direct link between the citizens of Europe and the European Union’s financing of its expenditure, and for the benefit of those individuals who are now calling again for there to be an increase in taxation, I would like to make quite plain that of course there must be no increase in the overall tax and contributions burden borne by the citizens, but then that was the position we took up back in March as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In the foreseeable future, as long as the budget is financed by the Member States, this principle means in practice that financing must take place under the same conditions for all concerned. There must be no more derogations or rebates in the future. We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have reached agreement on this demand, and that includes those individuals from Member States that continue to benefit from such derogations or are hoping to benefit from them soon. It represents a great step forwards and I am very proud of it. Indeed, I would call upon all the groups to support this compromise, which will be presented to them in the form of an amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, securing and consolidating our financial power to act also means acquiring new forms of revenue that we can truly call our own and that will replace the previous ones. But above all, it means not tampering with the only sources of income that are truly ours, that are the Union’s by right, that is to say, our traditional own resources. But this is exactly what will happen if the Commission’s proposal is implemented. If the refund – to be retained by the Member States – of the costs associated with the collection of these traditional own resources were to be increased by 150% then such fears would certainly be justified. Unfortunately, the majority in the Committee did not support my request to leave this refund at 10%. Personally speaking though, I am able to warmly endorse the present draft amendment, expressive as it is of the desire not to raise the amounts Member States are permitted to retain to 25%, for this would leave the traditional own resources intact.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if there is to be transparency, balance and manageability then the basis for financing must be unambiguous. The essential pillar as far as the current financing framework is concerned, is the gross domestic product of the Member States. This must continue to be the case for as long as the EU is financed by the Member States, for any other method would distort the system and render it illogical. The own resources ceiling of 1.27% expresses what proportion of gross domestic product has to be devoted to the European budget. This figure has become a politically reliable basis for cooperation based on partnership between Parliament and the Council. That is why it must be maintained and must not be changed arbitrarily. These are a few aspects of the proposal I am putting to you concerning changes to the own resources system.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there is no possibility of doing more at the present time since we have only limited room for manoeuvre in our actions. The consultation procedure in force here and, above all, the restrictive framework created by the Berlin Council’s agreements mean that we can only be moderate in our dealings. I would ask you all though, to at least give me your support as far as these draft amendments are concerned.</p>

Top of the agenda of the Committee on Budgetary Control was – what else can we do?: how can we monitor things in the best possible way? We have decided to maintain our viewpoint, as Mrs Haug has just stated that we must maintain the own resources ceiling at 1.27%, provided that the old calculation method is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the cost of collection, the Committee on Budgetary Control has not objected to the increase in this cost from 10 to 25%. As for the stand-by percentage of VAT resources, the Committee on Budgetary Control agrees with a reduction thereof and also approves of this reduction occurring one year earlier than planned in the Committee’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also of the opinion, as has been expressed by the Committee on Budgetary Control itself, that it is necessary that a reserve is built into the expenditure for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund so as to be able to cushion unforeseen expenses. As I have already stated, it is obvious that the control on revenue is paramount for the Committee on Budgetary Control. In this respect, we have attempted to refer to the work of this Parliament’s first Committee of Inquiry, the Committee of Inquiry which was involved in fraud in transit. Since the publication of this Committee’s report, we have heard very little in this respect. We would like to change this. We would like to be kept informed by the Committee on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to be gained from having a situation whereby revenue is collected from the Union which belongs to the Union but the work involved is carried out by the national services? We have therefore managed to have an amendment adopted which stipulates that in the year 2003, the Committee will need to submit an extensive report to demonstrate the level of improvements achieved since the work of this Committee of Inquiry. Finally, Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control is of the opinion that, at the half-way stage, we should once again look into a new system of own resources because if new countries join, the current system could well prove to be too complex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur applies certain questionable criteria, for example she accuses the Commission of having limited itself to applying Council guidelines. We must remind the rapporteur that that was the task which the Council entrusted to the Commission: to transform the political equilibrium of the fifteen into a concrete and viable proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the rapporteur’s request for a more transparent and simpler system, which is intelligible to all the citizens of Europe. We also agree that there is a need to take account of the citizen’s fiscal capacity and a need to seek new sources of income. The current system still contains regressive elements which should be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, however, that this is neither the time nor the place to impose expiry dates on the British rebate and the reductions granted to certain countries in the funding of the said rebate, especially when these proposed decisions have still not been approved in the various national Parliaments. It seems to us inappropriate to launch into this debate at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The benefits of belonging to the European Union cannot only be measured in budgetary terms, since there is the possibility that imbalances will be created. The Berlin agreements are a combination of the total level and the composition of spending, political reforms and the own resources system. The said combination must guarantee equity within a budgetary framework which includes enlargement. It is for this reason that it seems to us so inadvisable to modify the Berlin decision in the absence of a solid basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do we share your apprehensions concerning the application of the ESA(95). It is an accounting system which allows for a broader base for GDP resources and, consequently, greater financial resources, without surpassing the relative index expressly laid down in the Berlin agreements and in the interinstitutional agreement. Your fears concerning the modification of the 1.27% can simply be corrected by a downward adjustment of the ceiling on the said resources. It is therefore an unnecessary amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do we consider the amendments on the traditional own resources to be necessary. The 25% which the Member States are going to retain for collection expenses will allow for an administrative improvement in customs efficiency and the fight against fraud, which is an aspect that is frequently pointed out by the Court of Auditors. We also reject the idea of rewarding success in collection since this is incompatible with the principle of equity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we cannot accept the amendments which modify the timescale for the entry into force of the decision on own resources. Neither the political reality of the Union, nor the needs of enlargement, and much less the complexity of implementing a system which, in 1997 alone, cost EUR 82,469 million, make it advisable for Parliament to vote for changes to the said timescale.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we appreciate the continued efforts of the rapporteur, at least over the last year, in bringing together positions and putting forward a common position on behalf of this Parliament. There are already broad areas of consensus on the basis of which we can contribute to improving the funding of the Union, but the result of the vote in the Committee on Budgets shows that there are some ideas on which we are far from reaching a consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">For many of us, our final vote will depend on the result of the voting on various amendments, but, in its current wording, we prefer the Commission’s text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In her report, Mrs Haug is right to check the Commission’s arbitrary changes introduced through the back door, via a mathematical operation relating to the ceiling on own resources. Now in the interinstitutional agreement, the Council entered into a binding agreement with the European Parliament on the percentage of GNP, i.e. 1.27%. The Commission is now saying that this means cash value of 1.27%. This is not acceptable. The rapporteur emphasises that we should be striving to establish a more equitable system of financing the EU. The Community budget should have a fair system of revenue collection. The traditional own resources, for example, are a systematic source of inequitable burdens on Member States and, as has been said, are prone to fraud and excessive bureaucracy. Instead, the EU budget should be funded on the basis of criteria which improve the fairness of the system and what I would like to see therefore is a fair system of net contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking here on behalf of the Socialist Group, but if I were speaking as a British member, I would question particular references to the British rebate. If the budget is to be fair, there should not only be a fair system of contributions but also a fair system of spending. Unfortunately, such a fair system appears to be a long way off. I believe that a really serious attempt to reform the Community’s finances should start by making sure that all Member States get their fair share of expenditure. Until this happens, attempts to reform the own resources system will not improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what I want to see is a proper reform of the EU’s finances for the future. But reform cannot be focused on single issues such as the rebate and I feel very uneasy about discussing this issue at this stage in the new Parliament. It is too early to be making decisions on this subject and setting things in tablets of stone when all the facts are not in front of us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It continues a series of reports in which Mrs Haug has meritoriously and comprehensively analysed the EU’s system of own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The report under discussion is based on the decisions taken at the Berlin Summit, which involve many compromises. The most important basis mentioned were the estimates for Member States’ contributions, reconciliation on which became more important than safeguarding EU financing. The cornerstone of the system of own resources is still, however, the percentage a member pays out of GNP. The ceiling for committed contributions remains at 1.27% of GNP, which guarantees that EU revenue rises with inflation and general economic growth. </p>
<p class="contents">But this is where the system’s clarity ends. First, the premium paid for the collection of traditional own resources, i.e. customs duty and agricultural levies, was increased to 25%. This rise in the rate is, in fact, a clear concession to those countries that collect mostly customs duties, relatively speaking. The rise was justified by the need to collect contributions more efficiently, but that is not sufficient justification.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, the most problematic issue is the rebate in respect of contributions by the United Kingdom. The UK has been a member of the EU for 30 years, so it cannot be a matter of a transitional stage. The same might be said for the agreement made on the payment of this rebate. The reduced contributions by Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria do not have any proper justification either.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Haug’s report contains a proposal whereby a report on amending the system should be drafted before 2004. It should examine in particular concessions on contributions and the possibility of creating a new system of own resources that would relate directly to the public, without increasing their burden of taxation. The Liberals support this reform, all the while stressing that the burden of taxation must not be increased. Perhaps new forms of own resources could include environmental protection taxes, as environmental questions concern all, and not just the new Member States. It is important, however, that the new system outlined in the report should come into effect in all respects from the beginning of 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has hit the nail on the head with her observation that at the Berlin Summit, political ideals and ambitions had to give way to a short-sighted bookkeeping mentality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s own resources have the feel of national contributions. This is why the discussion on the system of own resources is being dominated by a net mentality: who are the net payers of the European Union and who make the net profits? It will be clear that the economic benefits appeal to the individual Member States, to the detriment of values such as stability, solidarity and welfare in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the net payers mainly focus on the revenue side of the budget. Consequently, a net mentality will mainly lead to missed chances. For example, the Netherlands has turned its back on the fund for refugees, a fund which, by the Netherlands own admission, it would benefit from disproportionately. But the Netherlands had prioritised “money back from Europe” over and above “value for money”.</p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin straitjacket means, above all, that Europe cannot realise its responsibilities. It leads to proposals in which Turkey, purely from financial motives, is offered a different political route of access. It leads to transitional periods which are far too long for the other candidate countries in terms of the environment, for fear that otherwise this, and I quote from the government document, “would lead to an increase in financial strain”.</p>
<p class="contents">Unexpected events – which are always to be expected – lead to unfortunate mishaps, to proposals where the reconstruction of Kosovo is at the expense of developing countries. </p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin Summit could also be dubbed the Summit of national exemption positions. Four countries were exempted from contributing to the United Kingdom’s exemption position. The rapporteur adopted a very wise viewpoint in this respect and has formulated a goal which I support, namely the abolition of all these exemption positions. The four countries which, rightly so, have rejected the British correction mechanism, should make an effort to rectify this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of levies, it has been proposed that the Member States can now retain 25% instead of 10%. Contrary to the rapporteur, I welcome this development, and I would even take it one step further. As far as I am concerned, Member States should be allowed to keep 100%, as long as we increase the rebate via the percentage of GNP. The GNP eminently reflects the economic development in Member States. It is, to my mind, therefore, the fairest instrument to distribute Europe’s financial responsibility over the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markov (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mrs Haug, first I would like to offer my thanks. Examining your report was a pleasure both for political and intellectual reasons. I firmly believe that the report describes what is deemed to be politically feasible, but I think that in view of the challenges that lie before us, it is our responsibility to draw up fundamental reforms aimed not at what is deemed to be politically feasible but rather at what is considered to be politically necessary. If one wants to change a system then one must establish clearly in one’s own mind what the disadvantages of the current system are, and I believe that these can be summed up under the following four main headings.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the existing EU own resources system has a very rigid framework. The sources of revenue are limited in number, some are on the wane and additional expenditure can only ever be financed if expenditure elsewhere is cut to pay for this. However, European integration has now reached such proportions that we have simply reached the limit of our capacity where this framework is concerned. This means that tasks such as enlargement of the Union, upholding human rights worldwide, and creating basic conditions for combating severe unemployment can no longer be tackled using this framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we want to be effective in our discussions on reform in this Parliament then ultimately, we as a Parliament must also be given the opportunity to have our say on all the aspects of the process. In this respect, the powers of the European Parliament in budgetary matters do not go nearly far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the existing structures for budgetary decision making are such that it is extraordinarily difficult for fundamental reform to be carried out. It stands to reason that the Member States will not exhaust the established ceilings when they are under pressure at home to have to overhaul their budgets and maintain the stability criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, discussion about a fair and balanced structure is justified on the one hand but also absurd on the other. Absurd because the Member States interpret the concept of fairness in such a way that, in the final analysis, they want to get out of the European Union’s budget that which they put in. That being the case, I for one would be only too happy to spare us the detour via the European Union. Fairness within the European Union can only mean one thing, namely that the original objectives of economic development, prosperity, and the balancing out of developmental differences constitute the criteria by which fairness is measured.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, every budget represents the financial implementation of political strategies. The European Union has undertaken to do a great deal in the course of the next few years. If, in so doing, we are only ever going to try and reduce expenditure, then it will simply not be possible to do justice to our political needs. And if, in addition, rebates, corrections to contributions and so on are to be introduced, then it is only fair to say that any enterprise carrying on in this way would go bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we must now concentrate our minds on how we can improve our revenue. Europe needs a financial instrument that, aside from the funds arising from gross domestic product, is independent of the particularist interests of the Member States. In other words, we need to raise our own taxes. The first report in March cited a whole range of positive suggestions to this effect, i.e. an eco-tax, a CO2-tax, taxation on the creaming-off of short-term speculative gains, ECB profits. This is the path we must go down if the European Parliament and European Union are to have sufficient own resources at their disposal in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In other times, French leaders would not have hesitated before adopting the policy of the empty chair on such a matter. Today, unfortunately, our country is the great loser of the Berlin Summit where the Fifteen agreed upon the review of the Union’s system of own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In Berlin, we effectively acknowledged the principle according to which some rich countries, those from the northern part of the Union, were paying too much, hence the revised weighting of Member States’ financing shares, resulting in the increased participation of France to the tune of several billion francs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, moreover, obvious that limiting the participation of some Member States in financing the UK rebate will have the effect of increasing the contribution of the others. As far as this corrective mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom is concerned, we obviously share the opinion of the Haug Report, which proposes that this privilege is gradually phased out, whereas the Commission is proposing only technical adjustments to the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the Haug Report, however, when it proposes to gradually reduce the system’s dependence on Member States’ contributions and to achieve financial autonomy in the long term. Financial autonomy, fiscal autonomy, is this not all leading up to the introduction of a European tax by the back door? At any event, financial autonomy of this type is still in line with that same rationale which we are clearly against. Ever greater integration, ever greater federalism within Europe, always to the detriment of nation states, eliminating their last remaining area of sovereignty, their fiscal sovereignty. We cannot accept this and we shall be voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we have another, a sort of Haug II, Return of the Haug, but it is a poor sort of comeback.</p>
<p class="contents">On 11 March, in our resolution, we voted in a paragraph stating: "believes that the revenue system should as a matter of principle be rid of exemptions and special arrangements" etc. We are well aware of what the Berlin Council made of this and what the Council based its Berlin Agreement on. Now, six months later in November, we are examining a report which makes no mention of this point except for a single amendment which, for my part, I would like to see adopted, but it is a Recital which attempts to say more or less the same thing in even vaguer terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental problem before us may be summed up simply as follows: either the system of own resources is referred to us under co-participation, as part of the package of measures which Parliament is asking the IGC to deal with so as to make it, as it were, more democratic, with greater participation, or else, unfortunately, all we can do on this point is note that the ball is in the Council’s court and will stay there for a long time if our proposals are not taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe and I hope, therefore, that Parliament may, on the basis of this report, be supported with revenue by this reference in particular as well as by others, and by the elements contained in it, and that Parliament will associate itself to a formal demand, according to which the Intergovernmental Conference will be authorised to tackle both the proposed reforms and also this fundamental aspect of the full participation of Parliament not only as regards the "expenditure" but also as regards the "revenue" of the Union budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The importance of this decision is obvious. Now that three decades have passed, the weaknesses of the current system are only too well known. It is not adequate and it is not simple, logical, transparent or fair. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore unsustainable. It is the result of successive, confused judgements which have been forced by the needs, pressures and interests of those who, in different contexts and historical periods, have had the ability to protect them. The perverse relationship between the contribution from each Member State and its relative ability to guarantee it is unacceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom’s system of positive discrimination, based on the destructive concept of fair return is unjustifiable. The idea of investing the European Union with own resources has, for this reason, remained a good intention. Even now, instead of introducing urgently needed reform, the Berlin Council has limited itself to a new raft of small judgements that have resulted from major commitments. </p>
<p class="contents">To insist on the current logic of expenditure in which the consequences of the common agricultural policy are increased, which, apart from jeopardising any aim for fairness which has been accepted as a principle of the Treaties, is political in name only. To insist on the system of revenues currently in force, the product of different, contradicting interests, is irreparably incompatible with the desire to develop the project of enlargement of our geographical area. </p>
<p class="contents">All of this has been studied, known and discussed for far too long. We are not even talking about disproportionate resources. This is a sum that corresponds, in the Council’s proposal for Budget 2000, to only 1.10% of the Community’s GNP and this year could reach 1.27%. This is a fundamental issue. The success of the European Union’s pledge before its citizens and the world depends on our ability to show that we are facing up to the necessary reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is a complex issue, as I know what a utopian idea it would be to try to start afresh. The past cannot be erased and has produced many good things. But to continue postponing decisions on this matter is to postpone much more than a difficult decision on the European Union financing system. It would affect a project in which I consciously maintain confidence, as do so many of our fellow citizens, aware as I am of its problems and its potential. Only a new approach to the issue of own resources which does not increase the fiscal burden on taxpayers, one which makes the system more transparent, simpler and more rational can provide the European Union with equitable conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Berlin was a step backwards in the field of own resources and, in general, in the field of European solidarity and construction of the political union. Both elements are probably linked, but I would not dare now to state which is the correct order of cause and effect. In any event, Parliament criticised it severely in the Spring.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on own resources which we are discussing today, which is merely a translation on the part of the Commission of the European Council’s political decision, is the best evidence of this retrograde step. All the features of the system which may lead to confusion between own resources and national contributions are highlighted. I wonder, by the way, why these national contributions were abrogated in Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s position is to condemn and rule out the application of the so-called principle of fair return to the European budget. Well, Berlin has confirmed that principle, and without daring to admit it, naturally, they have sided with Mrs Thatcher.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a disputed British rebate, for historic reasons which are becoming less apparent but which are understandable. Berlin maintains it but also offers four small rebates to Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, which are not exactly the poorest countries in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It increases the already scandalous 10% prima de collection premium to an unspeakable 25%. The only real justification for such an aberration is to lower the Dutch bill, despite the fact that the payment – to use the Council’s terminology – is inflated to the benefit of the Dutch coffers as a result of the Rotterdam effect. And that is what they want to hide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is completely unsatisfactory, as was the Council’s decision. We will only resolve the problems of own resources when we accept that the contributors are not the Member States but the citizens. What is unjust is the fact that two European citizens with an identical income make different contributions because of the mere fact that one lives in Frankfurt and the other in Seville. That is where the injustice lies. Therefore, it should be made clear that the objective must be that the citizens directly shoulder the burden of the Community budget without an opaque system of resources which will mask the process and prevent democratic accountability. Meanwhile, temporary solutions should be aimed at ensuring a certain degree of justice and transparency and not the reverse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The real problem is not between States, or between the States and the European Union. The real problem is between social classes. Of course, the draft resolution states, hypocritically, that this should not lead to an increase in the burden of charge on the European citizen. But it seems obvious that this is just an empty hope, and that future European taxes will be added to the others.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all the more opposed to any idea of increasing taxes because taxation, whether it be national or European, bears down on the working classes in particular. Throughout Europe the main taxation resource is the indirect taxes which are particularly unfair since they are paid by both the poorest and millionaires at the same rate. Thus, the most badly paid employees and even the unemployed or the homeless, when paying VAT on their food, are contributing towards financing the European institutions which, nonetheless, have not undertaken a single measure in their favour.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> of the European Union is to favour large firms by sweeping the obstacles out of their path, unifying their market in Europe and supporting them on the international market. And if it is necessary to pay more for the European institutions which are working on their behalf, well then, let the major firms pay, let us tax their profits and the dividends of shareholders, let them be forced to pay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the end of the day it will only lead to additional taxes being brought in and not to certain taxes being abolished. We believe that it will only be possible to reform the system of own resources with the agreement of the national parliaments, for we will also have to take their ideas into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we are in favour of systems being simpler and more transparent, and that ultimately we are also in favour of the burden on the citizens of Europe being eased rather than increased, so that we in Europe can achieve greater economic growth and in this way raise more taxes for the Union, that is to say for the national Member States. Before we advocate more autonomy though, we must exploit, that is to say fully explore, every available opportunity for making savings in the EU budget, and we must also explain to the citizens of the Union why we are permitting ourselves expenditure for two parliaments and are not coming up with simpler systems that would relieve the burden on the citizens of the Union rather than add to it. We will advocate simpler and more transparent systems, but we will not advocate putting even more pressure on the citizens of the Union in the form of additional taxation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the Commission nor Parliament have the power to provide an answer to these four questions. In this affair, we are the imaginary actors in a play written by someone else. Mrs Haug with her report has the great merit of doing this, by setting out a number of problems and heading in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Who must pay? States or individuals and economic operators? Current evolution is towards States and not towards individuals and economic operators. It is a dangerous tendency, going towards intergovernmentalism, towards the UN-isation of our system of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the bases for payment? Proportionality, progressive increase? We may well hesitate. Something that we can observe today is that if there is a step in the right direction, towards proportionality, we are in the process of inventing a new system, which involves making the contribution fit the expenditure. I pay, therefore I receive. I receive, therefore I pay. I give you subsidies, on condition that you pay for them. It is absurd! The situation is completely surreal.</p>
<p class="contents">What must be paid? Is anyone considering how much longer we can continue with such a limited collection rate at a time when the European Union is taking on more and more new responsibilities relating to the continuation of monetary union and enlargement of the Union, and to the assumption of foreign and security policy responsibilities? In this respect, our schizophrenia is rampant.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, who decides who must pay? At the moment, it is the States, and States only. This mechanism must absolutely be reformed. It is essential for the matter of own resources to be the focus of the next Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report by Jutta Haug recalls the objective of this overhaul. It is fourfold: to simplify the system, to create greater transparency thus making it more comprehensible, to strengthen the financial autonomy of the European Union and to reduce the imbalances between Member States’ shares in the budget. The envisaged readjustment of the balance between the four types of resource and, in particular, the reduction of the VAT share in favour of the GNP-related share of each country is of particular interest, since it is far more equitable. It is a better reflection of each citizen’s actual capacity to contribute. We consider this important, and it must be pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">While various elements have been underlined by previous speakers, I would like to return to two specific points. Firstly, it is essential that the imbalances in the current budget shares due to rebates, which are perhaps justified in terms of previous history, should be gradually, progressively but persistently dismantled and that the contributions of each country are brought to what they should be in objective, accounting terms. This simplification is essential for the equity of the system and for the transparency of management, two imperatives which will go towards ensuring the future of Europe. Particularly on the eve of enlargement, current practices for rebates or reductions are no longer justified and must therefore be inexorably abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to draw your attention to is one I find extremely strange. It is the request made by Member States to deduct administrative costs for collecting this tax, which may go from 10% to 25%. What justification is there for this usurious inflation? The strengthening of supervision and follow-up tasks for food safety are perfectly standard activities for states. The 10% basic rate must therefore be maintained, making it possible to amply cover the expenses incurred in this task. On behalf of the Parliament, I expect the Commission to take up the requirements mentioned above, since they are essential to our political objectives of clarity, transparency and equity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, in the same context, we reject concepts such as fair return or the false issue of net financial contributions. I understand that such a reform will have to target national contributions that correspond effectively to the respective economic development, so the GNP will have to be strengthened as an essential indicator for such contributions. This is what we have always maintained, in clear opposition to the repeated but inconsequential proposals for creating new jobs as a source of own resources. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why, on this matter, we agree with the Commission’s current proposal. We want to emphasise, though, that what is particularly relevant at the moment is the obvious shortfall in resources, a situation which is entirely due to the lack of political will and not to a need to reform the system of own resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, of course, not necessarily true. The responsibilities of the European Union are based on the principle that there are some things we can do more efficiently at European level. If we decide to transfer responsibility for agricultural industry from the Member States to the European Union and discharge that responsibility more efficiently, the end result could in fact be a reduction in the burden of taxation. Similarly, if we decided to transfer responsibility, say, for development cooperation, from the Member States to the European Union, I believe we could achieve immensely more in the world with the same amount of money and we could increase own resources while at the same time not increasing the burden of taxation on the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about democracy and transparency. First of all I would say that anything that we decide in a democratic way, through the institutions of the Union, about own resources, is what own resources are. If the European Union, in a democratic process, decides that own resources are simply a straight percentage of GDP collected by the Member States and passed over in a lump sum, that is fair enough: that is what own resources are and that is democratic. The more elements we drag in, the more un-transparent we make the system, the more difficult it becomes. That is why I am not concerned in the least by the 10% or the 25%. If we have a fixed figure that the European Union needs as own resources, then obviously if we leave the Member States more of what we call the traditional own resources, we have to collect more of that as a percentage of GNP. So this argument is not important all.</p>
<p class="contents">The balance of advantage, or the balance of returns to Member States, is extremely difficult to calculate. Let me make one further point on this. If you look at Holland and Germany, on whose behalf there was so much crying in this Parliament, you will find that the single market has given them immense benefits and they have had extremely positive balances in their trade with the rest of the Union over the years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, there is occasion for discussing the EU’s financial requirements if this process is to be managed successfully. At present, the EU is not entitled to raise taxes itself. Nor, as I see it, should it be entitled to do so in the future either. The Haug report does not involve our automatically introducing taxation by the EU, but it opens the door for taxation of this kind, which is bad enough. </p>
<p class="contents">What is not spelled out is nonetheless what a lot of people are obviously thinking. In the last few days, the Swedish mass media have been saying that the EU intends to introduce a tax on flights and mobile telephones. It is perhaps no accident that it is precisely in Sweden, which has far and away the heaviest burden of taxation in the EU, that imaginations are running riot when it comes to finding new forms of income from taxation. If taxes are to be directly discussed at all within the EU, then the Member States must first, in my view, show clearly and precisely which national taxes are to be reduced at the same time. Otherwise, our citizens will just be afflicted with new forms of taxation, and the EU’s citizens do not need still higher taxes. </p>
<p class="contents">How, then, is the enlargement of the EU to be financed? Yes, the alternative to new income from taxation is still that of reduced costs. This will involve better prioritising and concentrating on the major and crucial questions. The enlargement of the EU is one such priority. As long as almost half the EU’s budget goes on subsidising agriculture and as long as five sixths of it, including the Structural Funds, goes on subsidies of one kind or another, there can be no doubt that changes can still be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the Berlin Summit, changes to the revenue side were agreed on in respect of the maximum proportion of VAT paid to the EU, the British contribution rebate and the financing thereof, and with regard to the proportion of customs duties and agricultural levies that can be retained by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that we are justified in raising this amount to 25%. However, I would also like to make quite plain the fact that in return, I would expect the Member States to step up the measures for supervising the own resources as appropriate and to stop trying to talk their way out of this, so that these supervisory measures really do start showing favourable results. A decision was also reached as to when the Commission is to review the current financing system and report on the possibility of raising autonomous own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that Parliament has again had such an in-depth debate on the financing structure and I personally welcome still more the fact that I have been able to discern a great deal of common ground between my own basic position and the positions expressed today in the contributions to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In October 1998, the Commission presented a report on the revenue side of the budget and possibilities for reform. Many arguments put forward in this report are the same as those ventured by Parliament in its earlier Haug I report and in the Haug II report that we have here before us. All deliberations on reform ought to concentrate, above all, on making the revenue side transparent, effective and simple. There is no longer transparency in the current system on account of the copious individual provisions relating to the VAT rate of collection, the British rebate and the financing thereof. The citizens are no longer able to tell what proportion of their taxes is spent on the European Union. This lack of transparency is a bad thing and as such is reason enough, in my view, for us to endeavour to make reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view – as I emphasised during my hearing before this Parliament back in September – that it should be our aim in reforming the financing system to strengthen the financial autonomy of the Community. We need to create the opportunity to establish revenue without – and I want to stress this point – increasing the overall burden on the taxpayer. I also share the view that an equitable approach to planning the budget is not something that should be reserved for the revenue side alone, and I share the view that we should not wait until the year 2006 to have a debate on reform, but rather that the debate, together with its administrative back-up, should take place in this legislative period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
