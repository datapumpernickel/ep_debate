<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ojala </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span> Mr President, I should like to start by discussing the annual reports of the two health and safety committees. Both the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work and the permanent body for safety and hygiene in coalmines and other extractive industries work on the tripartite principle, which I hope the Community will adopt to a greater extent in the future. Both committees suffer from a lack of resources. Even so, they have succeeded in doing an excellent job. However, we should be thinking of ways to make the work of the committees more effective, such as through reorganisation, and to put their expertise to better use.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important aspect of the Community"s activities in the area of health and safety at work is legislation and its application. Considerable progress has been made in this field. Whereas in 1996 the Member States had transposed 74 % of the directives on health and safety at work into their national legislation, that figure has now risen to 95 %. Acceptance of the directives themselves, however, still does not mean they are being interpreted and applied correctly or that they are producing concrete results at the workplace. Enforcement is, however, what all the EU health and safety activities hinge on. The report contains specific demands for a total ban on asbestos, an extension of the cancer directive, a call for directives on physical factors, scaffolding and minimum requirements in the transport sector, as well as a proposal to protect those who work outdoors.</p>
<p class="contents">In its interim report, the Commission proposes four main priorities for the period 1998‐2000: firstly, more effective legislation; secondly, preparation for enlargement; thirdly, stronger links with the issue of employability; and, fourthly, the risks arising from changes in working conditions. These are important priorities. The Commission"s extended list of priorities will present a real challenge for action on health and safety at work. Occupational health and safety in the applicant countries is not nearly at the same level as in current Member States. They will need every possible kind of support to achieve the levels that exist in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining older people"s capacity for work is also one of the major challenges of the coming years, and I wanted to talk about the Finnish example here. In Finland, action to maintain the capacity to work is taken jointly by the employer, the employee and the cooperation organisations. Finland"s good record in this area could be taken as a model of good practice for the other Member States. There is a fundamental link here with employability.</p>
<p class="contents">Assessing the health and safety risks at the workplace is still too often limited to physical, chemical and biological risks. Nevertheless, muscular‐skeletal diseases and psycho‐social factors currently constitute the greatest threats to workers" health. Our committee has already mentioned stress, in particular, as being one of these. I would also draw attention to the issue of violence, which is a growing problem in the service sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also states in its interim report that the increase in female employment brings with it certain special problems connected with health and safety at work. I think we need to obtain statistics in this area, broken down by gender. Certain jobs that women do carry their own health and safety risks, which result, for example, from lack of autonomy, monotonous and repetitive work, and other such factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a word about the amendments. I am prepared to approve all of them other than Amendment No 1. Amendment No 2 I approve as an addition to paragraph 15 in the report. I cannot approve Amendment No 1, as it would reduce paragraph 3 of the report to a mere complaint about the small number of women on the committees and would exclude the important proposal for improvement. To explain what I mean, the Committee on Women"s Rights has pointed out, in the opinion it has drafted, that women comprise only 10 % of the employers and 20 % of the employees on the advisory committees, and it has urged that the proportion of women be increased. A more balanced representation of both genders is entirely feasible without impinging on the independence of the nomination system. In the Nordic countries there are excellent examples of this, and for that reason I recommend that Amendment No 1 be rejected.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Soltwedel‐Schäfer </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (DE)</span> Mr President, with regard to the report on safety, hygiene and health protection at work I should like to repeat, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament and as the draftsman of my committee"s opinion, that the carcinogens directive is extremely important and that we are particularly keen that the Council and the Commission should act upon this piece of legislation. Asbestos at the workplace is again included in the amendment I have proposed, and I would like to ask the previous speaker for clarification here: I did not gather whether she accepts my proposal or not.</p>
<p class="contents">The asbestos issue is not just about cleaning up buildings, which is what is happening at present, it is also about banning the use of asbestos at work, in the home and in buildings in general. Worker protection is another important issue in the context of the enlargement to the east. I very much welcome the fact that Mrs Bjerregaard has already been in contact with many people and has started talks about environmental measures in relation to the forthcoming enlargement, and I would like to see this aspect given greater consideration in worker protection and a higher profile in the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point is that it is true – and I have to agree with the previous speaker here – that safety, hygiene and health protection needs to be increasingly extended to include mental as well as physical aspects, focusing much more on issues such as violence and the psychological effects of working conditions. One type of workplace that is becoming increasingly common in the European Union is call‐centres, which are often more like battery henhouses than human workplaces, in that the employees earn very little and work under great physical and psychological stress. These call‐centres are cheap to operate and they are becoming increasingly prevalent, so this is certainly an area where the directives need to be changed and improved.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Skinner </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, Mrs Ojala has been very effective in the committee in driving through a very important report. I pay tribute to her patience and understanding on this issue. There are so many people dying each year or becoming sick and injured that we need to do everything we can to ensure that the activities of the European Union are focused in such a way that reduction is given priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Across Europe there are many bodies which play a role in protecting citizens' lives. Trends and patterns of work tell us that the terrain of that work is changing and we need to adapt new strategies, new techniques and new practices to take account of and anticipate the effects of this change. I can therefore support both the approach and the substance of Mrs Ojala's report because it moves in that direction. We should welcome this. One issue I particularly commend is the recognition of the type of work that agencies such as the Bilbao Health and Safety Agency perform. It should please us all that SMEs, which have been the scene of some of the worst accidents, are receiving special attention. Although Safe Action in Europe is no longer with us in body it is still with us in spirit. The Bilbao agency has succeeded in encouraging the process of spreading best practice effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, when health and safety will be defined by working times, scaffolding, chemical agents, carcinogens and, in particular, asbestos – and I am glad the Green Group raised this latter issue – Parliament should feel very proud of the role it has played in promoting the change which is going to be necessary to bring about a ban on asbestos. The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has played a key role in making sure that the scientific evidence is there to promote that ban and we can expect to celebrate before the European elections a dramatic reduction in the deaths caused by this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, most of all we should celebrate Parliament's vigilance. It is only by this vigilance that we are able to promote the best strategies which will effect the best practices. To this end, I regard this report as a major part of the machinery of good practice and effective regulation in this field. The rapporteur is to be congratulated for bringing it together.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pronk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too am grateful to the rapporteur for her report. It is a good report which has many very valuable things in it and reminds us of the importance of safety and health at work. This is an aspect of social policy which has actually generated the most legislation. It is also a part of the internal market. That is sometimes overlooked. If there are major differences in safety and health legislation, that leads directly to all manner of distortions of competition. So that is one of the reasons why we have such a broad range of legislation covering the field.</p>
<p class="contents">There has of late been a problem, I feel, in that the Commission has not done enough to ensure that the legislation is in fact complied with. It is only really in the last year and a half that the matter has been addressed with any vigour. That, I think, is one of the essential things which need to be done. And I believe we can distinguish between two stages: firstly whether the directives are actually transposed and, secondly, whether they are in fact implemented, in other words whether there is adequate scrutiny. That too is an extremely important aspect. These comments are all directed, really, at the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns Eastern Europe. I see we have Mr van den Broek here with us. It is perhaps worth making the point once again that it is important to appreciate that this directive and everything that goes with it is part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . I know from my own experience that there is sometimes the feeling in Eastern Europe that this is not the case, because people say yes, we want those other things, but these are all social directives and what have you, and all that is a bit difficult. Of course, we cannot accept that. It is a formal part of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> , but in order to enforce that in Eastern Europe too, it is indeed very important for us to begin programmes now which aim to bring both the technology and the legislation up to the mark on this point. I think that this is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the question of the committee itself. In one of her amendments, Mrs Ojala has made a direct attack on the independence of the social partners. The social partners play an important role in this committee, and she is seeking to restrict the social partners" right to appoint their representatives. That is not acceptable, in my view, and we have tabled an amendment accordingly. I think anyone who believes that the social partners should decide for themselves whom they wish to appoint will vote in favour of it, and anyone who has a sort of paternalistic view of the social partners will of course vote against; they will do so in the context of the politically correct thinking observed on the other side of the House, and they will in fact be saying ‘we are going to decide exactly whom the social partners can appoint". But that, I think, will spell the end of the road for the committee, because then the social partners will no longer be able to speak their own mind. They will be forced to say what others think.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the points I wished to make – my compliments to the rapporteur.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Boogerd‐Quaak </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, like other speakers, I think that Mrs Ojala has produced an excellent report here, and there are just one or two points which I should like to explore further.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I wish to underline the points she made about asbestos, an issue which certainly merits closer consideration at European level. I would also like to see attention being given to an area in which European legislation is still nowhere near as good as it might be, namely the need for proper consideration of organic mental syndrome. OMS attacks the nervous system and can cause severe forms of brain damage. The disease is caused by occupational exposure to chemical solvents such as toluene and xylene, in painters and decorators for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, Parliament approved the amended directive on the protection of workers against exposure to chemical substances at work, and this contains a number of provisions which are very important for the prevention of OMS. The amended directive introduces a statutory obligation to use less harmful substances in the work process in place of certain harmful chemical substances, including solvents. I believe that the substitution of low‐solvent products for high‐solvent products is a powerful way of helping industry to be innovative. However, reduced competitiveness is often cited as a reason not to use products which have a lower solvent content but a higher price.</p>
<p class="contents">Alternatives which are technically perfectly good and less harmful have been available for a long time – as I have pointed out on several occasions – and have already been made mandatory in the USA and the Scandinavian countries. Ideally, the Member States should transpose the changes to the directive into their national legislation as fast as possible. My country decided last year already to introduce mandatory substitution for a large number of chemical agents as of the year 2000. I would urge the Commission to ensure that other countries too make progress on this front.</p>
<p class="contents">Another answer might be to promote the use of reactive solvents, in which a chemical reaction causes the coating to become a part of the binding agent, so that it is not inhaled. I would point here to successful experiments on solvents obtained from the marigold, notably an experiment funded by the European Union which might thus be taken a little further.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should be grateful for some answers from the Commissioner to questions which I put some time ago at a special hearing in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I should like to know what further research the Commission is doing into substances suspected of causing OMS. I am also interested to know if the Commission is still prepared to tighten up the 1990 recommendation on compensation for people exposed to chemical substances. The European Court of Justice has already ruled that Member States must take account of OMS and set up systems of compensation.</p>

Although all political issues are equally important as a general rule, occupational health and safety can be regarded as particularly important because it involves social relations as well as being a technical issue. Mrs Ojala"s report allows us to consider this issue as requested, we should remember, by Finnish members of our group. There is a very pertinent comment in the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, drafted by Mrs Soltwedel‐Schäfer, which underlines that in the EU almost 8 000 workers die each year in industrial accidents and 10 million fall victim to such accidents or occupational diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation must be tackled conscientiously and responsibly. On the occasion of the 21st annual activity report of the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work, this report certainly hits home. We would have preferred the monitoring and assessment of this annual report of the Advisory Committee to have concentrated more on examining and updating Directive 92/57, although we agree that the mere transposition of directives is not enough and that these must also be effectively implemented and applied. We believe that it is important to ensure that all directives which are considered relevant are transposed into national legislation and that their effective application is monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Directive 92/57, we raised questions about its transposition and application which were unfortunately very opportune as they referred to serious accidents at civil shipyards in Portugal in October 1994 and March 1995, whereas the Portuguese Government did not transpose the directive until July 1995. However, transposing the directive is not enough, and we have stressed this, for example in the case of workers suffering from tendinitis at Ford Electrónica Portuguese in Setúbal, by means of questions to the Commission in November 1995 and January 1997. And we will continue to stress this point!</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this is not the only situation which needs to be tackled, as we are seeing a general trend which must be resisted. Monitoring in this area indicates that general conditions, the working environment and occupational health and safety are not developing positively. As pointed out very clearly by Mrs Ojala in paragraph 25 of her report, ‘some types of atypical working conditions and subcontracting have led to an increase in workplace accidents". This is why the report urges the Commission to stress to the Member States that the directives must be complied with and that compliance must be closely monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the general framework for the reorganisation of work also needs to be revised. We should remember that, when President‐in‐Office of the Council, the Luxembourg minister Mr Junker commented that the policies of weakening and creating uncertainty in contractual employment relations result in an increase in the number of accidents at work. He also said that uncertainty is the working condition which most seriously threatens the health and safety of workers. This is why problems must be tackled on the basis of industrial relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the Green Paper on the reorganisation of work, the House now needs to deliver its opinion on a Commission communication. This is a major issue, but unfortunately the report on this, for which I am responsible, will not now come before this House as there is not enough time. I must therefore take the opportunity to stress that this report tackles questions which are unquestionably of prime importance, as they concern working conditions, working relations and the duration of work and therefore particularly affect health and safety at work. I would also make the point that, significantly, although there is time to discuss minute details on currency matters, there is not enough time for these vital and urgent issues to be debated.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lataillade </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our colleague Mrs Ojala critically examines two types of document. The first type covers two activity reports: one from the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work, and the other from the Safety and Health Commission for the Mining and Other Extractive Industries. The other type, that is by far the most interesting and, I would say, more political, is the mid‐term report from the Commission on the Community Programme concerning Safety, Hygiene and Health at Work. And from the outset, my group should like to compliment Mrs Ojala on this excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first two reports, we fully agree with the criticisms expressed by the rapporteur over a certain lack of transparency in the data from the Advisory Committee. We also share the rapporteur"s concern for the lack of financial resources for concrete proposals aiming to improve the situation in the workplace and the exchange of information, and, in fact, these resources are currently decreasing. Such concern may have become evident through the Safety and Health Commission"s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The interim report is a more political report as it relates to the Community Programme for two periods: 1996‐1998 and 1998‐2000. In relation to the first chapter, we support the observations made by the rapporteur on the four fields covered by the excellent work of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, based in Bilbao. We support her comments on the unjustified cuts in resources allocated to the European Foundation in Dublin. We agree, too, with the points made regarding the Council"s disappointing attitude that led to it rejecting the SAFE programme which aims to encourage specific projects in the field of health and safety. Lastly, we agree with the rapporteur on the positive developments in terms of legislation, particularly as regards transposing these laws into national law in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For the 1998‐2000 period, we also share the concerns expressed by our rapporteur that, as we see it, relate to two areas. There must be a more careful analysis of the new world of work as in our societies we are seeing changes in working conditions, a growing service sector, an increase in the number of women in employment and the ageing of the workforce as well as new ways of organising work. We will not go into the details here, but added to this, new risks are also emerging. There are indeed physical, chemical and biological risks, but there are also risks linked to muscular‐skeletal diseases and also to psychosocial factors. This aspect has already been mentioned so I will not go back over it.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is in keeping with our concerns from three points of view. Firstly, it reflects our desire to establish vital social measures for all countries in the Union. It discusses the economic challenge that the world of work. Finally, it looks at the situation of work both within the Union and in relation to third countries. It also highlights the fact that we have a duty to be politically accountable. This is why this report must be followed up and why efficient proposals must be provided to meet our common concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to once again complement Mrs Ojala on her report and assure her that our group will vote in favour of it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wolf </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Ojala, who has once again demonstrated that someone from the Left who shows a sense of commitment and responsibility can really help to improve the quality of the work done by the entire House. What is this issue all about? It is about a revolution in the world of work, which is currently undergoing fundamental changes. The traditional factories and conveyor belts and the safety measures that went with them are all in decline. In the single market, we need to ensure that the new forms of work organisation do not lead to more uncertainty and stress, and that conditions of employment which are protected by social and labour legislation are not gradually replaced by conditions determined by commercial law. We must also ensure that the progress achieved in working conditions under the old structures, particularly at national level, is genuinely reflected in new and appropriate forms at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two types of mechanisms here: the balance of interests and communication on the one hand, and the Community programme on the other. I think it is quite clear that the social partners" right to make appointments is an important element of their independence, but it is also our job to ensure representativeness and efficiency. I therefore think that Mrs Ojala is right on this issue, rather than the PPE Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the subject of the Community programme, some of the major points such as asbestos and mental strain have already been mentioned. Parliament has already done a considerable amount of work on these, but there is still more to be done. Generally speaking, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in this field needs to be deepened and we need to ensure that we are properly prepared for the process of enlargement to the east and, in part, to the south, which will bring new generations of workers into the single market. It will be absolutely vital to ensure that every employee has fair, healthy and humane working conditions, because that is, after all, what this is all about. The humanisation of working life is the task that now faces us in the single market.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Maes </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I must firstly also offer my compliments to Mrs Ojala. Secondly, I wish to comment on the question of structures. In Mrs Ojala"s report, we find criticism of the fact that the Advisory Committee and the Safety and Health Commission have too few women members. On the other hand, I hear it said here that we ought not to concern ourselves with that, because it would look like paternalism vis‐à‐vis the social partners. I protest very vigorously against that attitude, because I cannot believe that the social partners would be unsympathetic to the idea that women, being involved in all areas of economic life, must consequently be involved in all areas of decision‐making. Perhaps we should just give the social partners a little nudge, so that they give women with the necessary ability the chance to become members of these bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticism I read in this document of the bodies set up by the Commission is fairly fierce. The accusation is made of a lack of transparency on all sides over the substance and results of the work of the Advisory Committee and of all the new working parties which have been set up, eight of them in 1996. And may I draw the attention not only of Parliament but of the Commission and the bodies it has set up to the criticism made by the Committee on Women"s Rights, namely that the reports pay too little attention to typical gender effects. Gender issues, and I quote ‘must not be restricted to pregnancy and breast feeding, but should be related to all health and safety issues and their impact on women". I would argue that for men too there may be typical work‐related problems and conditions, and we would like to see more attention paid to those. There is more than just reproductive health at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">Various honourable Members have mentioned the mental stress factors which increasingly affect workers. Take yesterday"s bus strike in this city, when bus drivers protested at the danger they run at work, where they are regularly the victims of violent attack. Take the conditions which make life very difficult for teachers in some Member States. Take the fact that after a few years, nearly all nurses start to have back problems, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second point I should like to expand on – previous speakers have done so too – namely the removal of asbestos. The Commission of course earned itself brownie points by spending a great deal of money on stripping the asbestos from the Berlaymont building. But the Commission probably never knew about the irresponsible way in which this was done by the workers in charge of removing the asbestos, about the way in which the asbestos waste from the building was driven away through the streets of Brussels. You should make sure that you are better informed, instead of sitting shuffling papers and smugly concluding that on paper everything looks just fine. It is true that the public authorities are increasingly aware of the problem of asbestos, but in the same town where a small museum is obliged to remove asbestos sheets from its ceiling, asbestos is still being produced, and the Commission really must do something about that.</p>

But it does not tackle the key issue, namely those cases in which total EU harmonisation will come into conflict with the Member States' wishes to have better rules than those adopted in the Community. When the EU adopts provisions on the environment and the working environment as such, they apply as minimum provisions under which we all have the right to go further. We always support those in the June Movement. However, the problems arise when rules are adopted instead under provisions relating to the internal market, because then a majority decision taken in a secret committee or a closed Council of Ministers meeting can put the Folketing in the dunce's corner and abolish a law, even when it has been adopted unanimously in the Folketing. Take the cancer list, for example. Now Danish workers have to handle substances which both the World Health Organisation and the Danish authorities regard as carcinogenic, because the Commission will not present a proposal and because 62 out of 87 votes in the EU cannot be found to prohibit them. For creosote, Denmark has invoked the environmental guarantee and banned the substance because it can cause cancer, but in the EU it is now forbidden to forbid the substance, and the Commission has not yet approved the Danish use of the environmental guarantee. When the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force, no doubt we can expect a letter from the Commission requiring us to outlaw the Danish ban on creosote, because the Amsterdam Treaty does not permit countries to go further than the majority where measures relating to human health are concerned. Free movement for carcinogens takes precedence over public health! Let me call on the Commissioner – in conclusion to this debate – to announce instead that it is intended to propose a ban on creosote throughout the EU.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Amadeo </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the contemporary world of work requires specific controls to ensure that safety and health protection standards are adequate to meet the challenges of a society which has long since passed the so‐called post‐industrial stage.</p>
<p class="contents">When we refer to safety at work, we automatically think of the structures already in place. My first comment relates to asbestos, its use and its applications: some are known, others are as yet unknown or not covered by a rather toothless Community directive. This strikes one immediately and therefore merits particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because of its need to adapt to the demands of a rapidly developing society, the world of work is beset by difficulties which have caused new psychoses, as well as genuine new occupational diseases that are still under investigation but very much need to be regulated. I am thinking here of the steady increase in cases of work‐related stress, fatigue resulting from sedentary or repetitive activities, but also those with indirect causes such as sexually motivated violence and harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is undoubtedly a need for a European agency, and we therefore hope that the Bilbao agency, which already exists, will become truly operational. But above all, the second phase of the SAFE programme needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The present rate of transposition of the directives into national legislation is looking very positive, in that it rose from 70 % in 1996 to 96 % last year. Of course, much still remains to be done, but we hope, or rather we believe – with our congratulations to the rapporteur – that we are working along the right lines.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blak </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I was immensely pleased when I saw that my good friend, Jens‐Peter Bonde from the June Movement, was finally going to take part in this debate. I thought that we would be hearing something constructive and positive. But it turned out to be one of the usual propaganda speeches, focusing on what are transient issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is a good and important initiative. It is important that the EU and the European Parliament pursue an active and progressive policy in this area. The EU must be a lever for better safety and health in the Community's workplaces. Industrial injuries and accidents cost billions of euros every year, but more than anything they represent personal tragedies and costs. Often it is too late when the damage has occurred. That is why it is so important to allocate sufficient resources for research and prevention. It is not just a good investment from the economic point of view; it is an investment whose results cannot be assessed in terms of money.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Parliament is calling on the Commission in this report to do something serious about the asbestos problem. It is time that asbestos was completely banned. Many workers have been exposed to this dangerous substance over the years, with catastrophic consequences. The after‐effects are something people have to live with for the rest of their lives, and often they develop cancer – a disease which we all know can be fatal and painful. So we must demand a total ban.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me stress how important it is that the EU should be constantly at the cutting edge of developments. We must not just sit on our hands and wait for more accidents to happen. We must take an active stance and put pressure on the Member States to act before the damage occurs. We must focus on new forms of industrial injury, which can involve skeleto‐muscular damage. For example, many people who work in offices contract repetitive strain injury, because they use a computer all day long. Also, the psychological working environment is a problem which for too long has not been taken seriously. In addition, we must of course campaign to bring about a reduction in limit values which apply to dangerous substances. The EU"s citizens are entitled to expect and demand action from the European Parliament in constantly monitoring and developing a safe and healthy labour market policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, may I begin by presenting the apologies of Commissioner Flynn, who is unfortunately unable to be here for today"s debate, but to whom occupational safety and health is a subject of the utmost importance. With the help of his excellent officials, I shall stand in for him as best I can.</p>
<p class="contents">May I express, in particular, my appreciation of the work done by the committee as a whole, and even more particularly of the excellent work done by the committee"s rapporteur, Mrs Ojala. Her report contains much that the Commission is anxious to consider and act on. We agree on the fundamental importance of promoting safety and health at work in the countries of the Union. Much has already been achieved at Union level, and we must continue to build on this in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s priorities for future action are grouped under four main headings. The first priority is to make EU safety and health legislation more effective. The Member States have already made considerable efforts in that direction, and 95 % of Community instruments have now been fully transposed. We now have to concentrate on actual implementation of the national legislation and ensuring that it is effective. We must also constantly review existing directives and update and streamline them where necessary. The Commission takes note of your constructive suggestions on how we can best ensure that the legislation is made as efficient as possible. The ultimate objective must be to prevent and minimise the number of accidents at work. The Commission will wholeheartedly support Member States" initiatives to create the necessary culture of safety amongst employers and the workforce. The Bilbao Agency and the Foundation in Dublin play a key role in this policy as providers of information. Better information to small and medium‐sized enterprises is of course crucially important.</p>
<p class="contents">A second priority is the work of preparing for enlargement of the European Union. In the area of occupational safety and health too, the applicant countries will have to make significant efforts if they are to reach the level of safeguards required in the Union. The Commission monitors the degree to which the applicant countries satisfy the criteria of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . From the results of that, we can determine the kind of help we need to provide. There is a need for training, information and technical know‐how, as you say in your motion for a resolution, and it serves no one"s interest to have poor working conditions used as a means of competition in the internal market. I say that also in response to something which was said by Mr Pronk.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is to strengthen the link with employability. More sustainable jobs and the promotion of employability are two of the principal elements of the European employment strategy. Measures to improve health and safety at work can make a significant contribution to these activities. We know that accident prevention is crucially important to individual workers and their families, but we often underestimate its economic benefits. Fewer accidents mean more work, better competitiveness and lower costs to social security. That is perhaps not sufficiently understood by the policy‐makers and is not taken into account sufficiently in political decision‐making.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth priority is the consideration which needs to be given to new risks. The labour market, as various honourable Members have pointed out today, is developing and changing fast. The transformation of the economy into a service‐based economy, the steadily increasing number of women who work, the ageing of the workforce, the large‐scale use of new technologies and new forms of organising work all have implications for safety. The European Commission will place greater emphasis on identifying the consequences of these changes and will ensure that these matters are addressed in future health and safety policy. In this context, your analysis is also extremely relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">You rightly stress in your report that the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty will greatly strengthen the role of the European Parliament and the social partners. The Commission is already busy drafting the necessary measures. The Commission believes that the correct forum for conducting a dialogue on health and safety at work is the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work. It plans to strengthen this committee by merging it with the Safety and Health Commission for the Mining and Other Extractive Industries.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of questions have been asked, and in response to these I would also say that Parliament"s resolution stresses once again the importance of research in this field. The Commission cannot but agree entirely, and I would add that due attention is given to this in the fifth framework programme of research and development and that under this programme of research, support must in fact follow for community activities in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Boogerd mentioned new diseases, including organic mental syndrome resulting from the use of certain chemicals. This field too is receiving attention under the fifth framework programme, which has as one of its themes the prevention or combating of the effects of stress.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question about possible compensation, I think it will be better to discuss that once the research I mentioned just now has provided us with a better understanding of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the ban on asbestos has been mentioned several times and by several different speakers. It is true that some types of asbestos have not yet been banned. That too is something we are still researching in Directorate‐General III, for which Commissioner Bangemann is responsible. Once we know more by way of results from the study in question, we shall brief you in greater detail. So that too is being looked into by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with that, and I thank the House once again for your most useful suggestions and contributions. These will point us in the right direction and be of great benefit to worker safety and to the economic prosperity of the European Union.</p>

Yesterday Mrs Stenzel talked about the avalanche disaster in the Tyrol, and I would like to thank her for her words, which we wholeheartedly endorse. Unfortunately, she specifically said that she was speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and her own delegation, thus leaving out a third of the Austrian Members. This was a pity, because in view of the terrible scale of the disaster, we would have been happy for her to speak on our behalf too. This is no time for internal political grudges. On behalf of the non‐attached Members, therefore, I should also like to convey my deepest sympathies to the families of the victims.</p>
