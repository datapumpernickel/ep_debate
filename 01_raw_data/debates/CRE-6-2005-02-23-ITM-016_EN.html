This led to the Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty on 20 September, signed by 111 governments, including the governments of all the Member States. This initiative updates and relaunches the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the last paragraph of Article 3 of the Constitution for Europe that is currently undergoing the ratification process proclaims the European Union’s adherence to international law and to the United Nations and its Charter. There is also a clear commitment to the Millennium Agenda and a proclamation of the principle of free and fair trade.</p>
<p class="contents">This all calls for renewed and greater effort, not only by the Member States, but also by the Union as a whole. This is the right time for us to be informed of the views held by the Commission and the Council on important matters of current concern, such as the situation in Africa or climate change. It is also the right time for us to intensify our financial contribution to development aid, ensuring implementation of the Millennium Agenda. In particular, it is the right time for us to assume a responsible and leading role in a matter of such crucial importance to the future of mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe this should also apply to the mandate to be granted to the Commission as we approach the Hong Kong Summit in the development of the Doha Round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Outlawed.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of people living in extreme poverty has risen – and I do not intend to bore you with details or numbers, because you already have them – but, as stated in the New York Declaration, the greatest scandal is not so much that hunger and poverty exist, but that this problem persists despite there being the necessary human and material resources to tackle it.</p>
<p class="contents">Both President Lula da Silva and the Quintet countries are strongly in favour of this Declaration, which was also mentioned by Mr Barón Crespo, according to whom it has been signed by 108 governments, whereas I believe the number to be 111. The Quintet has recommended new funding instruments for development, which I am not going to list here (taxation and similar strategies). Although I support the new instruments, I think that they should be considered additional to and not a replacement for the existing instruments and they should be pooled in a global fund managed by the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, eradicating poverty in poor countries, but now also in classes of the so-called rich countries, means respecting the right to life and also constitutes the best weapon against fundamentalism and violent conflicts. The structural adjustment programmes and unbridled liberalisation have certainly not improved living conditions in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Millennium Development Goals, referred to by Mr Barón Crespo, should be considered an essential intermediate stage, but certainly not the final one. Likewise, declarations of principle must be followed up with tangible actions, including the doubling of contributions for development. I extend my congratulations to certain European countries – Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden – which are already allocating 0.7%, and to others which are moving in the same direction, while I truly regret that in my country, Italy, there is a trend in the opposite direction. I hope that it is possible to reverse this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are also committed to cancelling debt and in my view the transparent management of aid must also be one of the EU’s express, fundamental commitments. We are not and must not feel alone. We must also contribute to the development and growth of the role of the United Nations and its agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This initiative has not been without effect. There is now a real awareness, firstly an awareness that poverty and hunger in the world constitute a real scandal, and then, beyond that, an awareness that they pose a permanent threat to stability and normal development. We have talked a lot, this morning and this afternoon, about democracy in the developing world. The ‘Make Poverty History’ initiative launched by Tony Blair, by the UK Presidency of the G8 countries, is to some extent in line with this action, and some time ago we had a debate on the issue of reducing, or even cancelling, the debts of the poorest countries. Now, therefore, this initiative by President Lula, together with other Heads of State, should be followed by practical action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that so far the Council has not yet adopted a position on the innovative sources of finance for aid to developing countries. However, you will have become aware that a certain number of ideas have been put forward, which are currently under discussion and which are no longer regarded as taboo. Thus a subject such as the taxation of aviation fuel is no longer taboo, but forms one of the routes which are currently being studied in the move towards new sources of finance enabling us to combat poverty more effectively. Moreover, the search for such innovative sources of finance is one of the eight commitments defined in Barcelona in 2002 by the European Council with a view to implementing the Monterrey Consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">In Barcelona, the Member States of the European Union confirmed their willingness to make a series of eight commitments, known as the Barcelona Commitments, which should be regarded as eight different aspects of the European Union’s action towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with the aim of eradicating poverty. Heaven knows that we are still, in the case of many countries, and particular sub-Saharan countries, very far from achieving those goals, for example as regards access to water, access to education and access to proper food.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions of 27 April 2004, the Council, noting the work currently being carried out in Member States on innovative sources of finance, encouraged the Member States and the Commission to examine the possibilities for agreement on the various proposals currently under discussion. In that connection the Council emphasised the important role of partnerships between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting in June 2004, the European Council confirmed that the European Union would intensify its efforts with a view to meeting the commitments made at Monterrey, in particular by seeking the innovative sources of finance which I have already mentioned. In addition, at its latest meeting, in December 2004, the European Council confirmed that the European Union is completely committed to the Millennium Development Goals and to the idea that we should ensure that progress is made towards achieving them, particularly by seeking new methods of finance based on the proposals submitted by the Commission for the high-level meeting in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The time for action has arrived, the time for proposals has arrived, and I believe that the Council is now waiting for the Commission to submit proposals, in the hope that they will depart somewhat from the old, well trodden paths, and really will contribute something new. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span>My colleagues, my fellow-Commissioner Mr Michel, who is dealing with this specific issue, sends his apologies and naturally I am happy to take this question on his behalf. The Commission endorses the fundamental standpoint that prompted the Quartet to consider new sources of funding. In order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, we need a significant increase in financial resources, especially ODA – official development assistance. This must go beyond the increase that was agreed in Monterrey and the associated commitment to development financing. However, as the World Bank notes in its report to the Committee on Development, the simplest and most effective way of increasing the available resources is to provide a greater proportion of funding for development assistance from national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has already adopted this course in fulfilment of the commitments undertaken in Barcelona in 2002 and will pursue it further, possibly at an accelerated pace. We intend to make practical proposals which will be presented by my colleague Louis Michel to the Commission for discussion before they are forwarded to the Council, notably in the context of the Commission Communication, now being prepared, which follows up the Monterrey Conference, and in relation to a consolidated project for the Millennium Summit +5 review conference in September 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal view is that the current innovative proposals, such as the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, are very interesting and we will, of course, take part in the discussions within the various bodies. However, they should not serve as a pretext for putting the Monterrey commitments on the back-burner or downgrading them. On the contrary, these commitments must be reaffirmed and new ones must be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet sometimes merely giving money has no effect. As a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and hence a representative of education, which the Commissioner mentioned earlier, I would like to draw your attention to one issue. The research I have carried out to date indicates that only a little over 30% of those who come from poor countries to study at leading European, American or other universities return to their countries of origin, whether they are here to gain master’s or doctoral degrees. We are helping one or two people individually, but this is no help at all to the poor country. What needs to happen is for these people to return as technological experts in agriculture, education or any other field, in order to become the elite and the driving force of the economy. This is one way to reduce hunger and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the matter we are discussing here, I once had the opportunity to exchange a few words with Commissioner Michel, and I believe that we agree that it would be useful to put forward a proposal, and if possible to implement it, whereby a certain amount of money would be earmarked in the budget to help those returning to poor countries to adapt, or rather re-adapt, to poverty during the transitional period before they find a suitable job that is in keeping with their skills. This would be a great help, and in some ways an extension of the scholarships and financial assistance we offer for them to come here and study in our countries. In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we do not really need these Ph.D.s from Mali or the Congo, as we have our own, yet they are very much needed in their own countries. I am therefore very much in favour of this proposal. If necessary, I will draft it properly, including data, and submit it to the Committee on Development as a proposal for the Commission. I would like everyone here present and the Commissioner to devote their attention to this now. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, back in 2000, the world leaders signed a declaration in which they committed themselves to meeting the Millennium Goals by 2015 or thereabouts. Now in 2005, the world can see that, in Africa, a goal such as ‘everyone to school’ is not moving any closer but has edged further away. Similarly, the financing pledge of 0.7% of the national budget has not been fulfilled by a long shot.</p>
<p class="contents">A declaration of this kind in 2004 may then seem a little like ‘management by declaration’; unless, with that declaration added to Jeffrey Sachs’ report and the massive wave of sympathy and funds that have been freed up by the tsunami disaster, new political will is organised. That, to my mind, should be done straight away, and not by setting up a new world fund, but by fully concentrating all existing aid sources – the World Health Fund, the European Development Fund, the activities of the IMF and the World Bank – from both north and south on the MDGs – the Millennium Development Goals. Firm agreements, tight control and coordination are what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, being the world’s largest donor, can take the lead. At the same time, all European Member States should be able to achieve 0.5% of the national budget for development cooperation by 2010 and 0.7% by 2015. The EU itself should set aside 10% from its own financial multi-annual perspectives, channelled via a single development budget, with the MDGs being the legally binding instruments. Debt relief for poor countries would also form part of this, thereby making room for water, education and basic amenities; hence also the need for the IMF to revalue the gold reserves. This also involves fair trade and an immediate end to export subsidies, while also looking for new sources, not with the intention to forget the 0.7, but to think about new sources that would be interesting. It is also a good idea to impose taxes on the negative side of globalisation, such as ‘flash capital’ or the arms trade. Now is the time to act. I think that the presidency is in good hands and is keen to move in that direction along with Mr Michel and the other Commissioners. It will be primarily by the multi-annual financial perspectives that the value of all our declarations will be able to be judged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People claim, with good reason, that there is a connection between the provision of aid, debt relief and trade, and that actions in those three areas should complement each other. Today, I should mainly like to focus on the trade aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The ability to integrate in the world economy is beneficial to all countries, whether rich or poor. By way of concrete example, we could juxtapose comparable countries, for example South versus North Korea, or the Asian tigers versus the South-Asian countries. A free, fair and development-minded multilateral trade system is indeed an effective mechanism in order to drive back poverty and hunger. The European Union, in particular, must guarantee the poorest countries better access to the world market by granting priority to capacity-building and technical assistance, thus enabling trade to generate as much development as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO’s next ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December will be a crucial test to see to what extent the rich countries are serious about giving the poor countries a good chance of being able to integrate fully in global trade. Doha has been presented as the ideal development round and after Cancun, we cannot afford a second failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Whichever way, further liberalisation of world trade is a basic condition for more economic growth, both here and in the developing countries. In addition to aid and debt relief, a correctly liberated market is a very important, if not <span class="italic">the</span> most important, instrument for distributing prosperity in the world more effectively and more evenly and for narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So we cannot, on the one hand, discuss the possibility of increasing development aid funds and, on the other hand, pursue agricultural policies that contribute to a worsening of the situation in many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example, the EU is currently negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements with the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries that are causing a great deal of concern, or even opposition, with regard to the direction now being taken. This is because the discussions are concentrating almost exclusively on an indiscriminate liberalisation of trade, without taking account of local conditions, while large numbers of cheap, often subsidised, exports from our countries are already playing a part in seriously destabilising the situation for farmers in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that all these issues need to be examined at the meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly which will take place in Bamako in April. I hope, on behalf of my group, that the direction taken by the European Union in this area will change so as to achieve greater consistency between what we are saying today about hunger and poverty and what we are saying elsewhere, in other arenas, about agricultural policy and the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. This is a truly fundamental question. If we can start now by making sure our deeds reflect our words, I think we will have taken a real step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the 1960s, Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, published a book called <span class="italic">Asian Drama</span>, in which he talked about an atmosphere of pessimism. At the same time, an optimistic atmosphere prevailed in Africa, because Africa had far greater resources than the Asian countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation today is completely the opposite. The doctrine of Afro-pessimism is spreading, while a number of Asian countries are moving forward. This results from the behaviour of the leaders, and it relates to the cultural underpinnings, as Africa has been dominated by tribal structures which subsequently achieved political power. It also relates to the quality of the institutions. I must say that this comparison between Africa and Asia gives a pointer as to the direction European Union policy should be taking in the field of development aid, in order to ensure that the available resources are being used appropriately in the interests of economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Union has recently undergone enlargement to include poor countries. In December, one of my constituents, who was invited to visit the European Parliament in Brussels, told me that in his village it is sometimes the case that children are unable to go to school because they do not have shoes, to say nothing of school supplies. The minimum welfare benefit in Poland is between EUR 10 and EUR 100 per month, and the minimum wage is EUR 212. Would it not also be possible to establish a fund for the citizens of the Union along the lines of the fund that we are debating, or to force Member States to pay at least EUR 250 per month to those in need?</p>

That is a generally known fact, but it is also known that if we really put our minds to it, we can still achieve them, and to that we must commit ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Fighting hunger is one of the most important action points. Every day, some 24 000 people die of starvation and malnutrition. That is 24 000 too many. Our line of approach can only succeed if we adopt coherent policy in the areas of development aid, agriculture and trade, and deliver on our commitments. For that reason, I wholeheartedly back this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention one item that is not explicitly mentioned in the resolution, namely the position of women. Studies have shown that the role of women is crucial to the success of development cooperation policy, yet women are still insufficiently involved in the preparation and implementation of programmes in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am impressed with the work that has gone into the Hunger project, concerning which a huge awareness campaign was recently launched in the Netherlands. It is a worldwide organisation that combats hunger in many developing countries. Their formula appears extremely successful, precisely because it is mainly geared towards women via training, the provision of information, micro-credits, and such like. Through these, they manage to bring about a significant and permanent improvement in social circumstances and drive back hunger. Women take up a key position in society in terms of agriculture, education, hygiene in the family, and such like, which are crucial factors in combating hunger.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we manage to adopt more effective policy by means of more decisive and more coherent policy. As the largest donor, Europe should play a pioneering role in working on the Millennium Objectives and should, in this respect, not forget to involve women in the relevant countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He promised to lead the country into the Quintet engaged in combating hunger instead.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Zapatero has kept his promise. Under President Lula’s direction, this Quintet has succeeded in placing the fight against hunger and extreme poverty on the international agenda. I myself had the honour of presenting the first document on this issue to the House. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, I believe the European Union must spearhead the international community’s effort to attain that objective. Secondly, the objective is attainable. The technical, financial and economic means to overcome hunger and consign it to oblivion are available. Thirdly, because I believe the fight against hunger and poverty is not simply a question of development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">This crusade must become one of the axes or one of the pillars of the foreign policy of the European Union and of its Member States, and this is already coming about. Fifteen or twenty years ago, human rights and development aid were key strands of foreign policy. It is now time for the fight against hunger and poverty to become more than a campaign, Commissioner.

Rich countries and supranational organisations with significant financial resources, such as the European Union, bear a special responsibility in this respect. In order to reduce hunger effectively, there must be an appropriate hierarchy of spending in the budgets of all countries. Priority should be given to measures that promote a pro-family policy, understood in the broadest sense of the word, in order to ensure that everyone has adequate conditions in which to live and develop. It is an unfortunate fact that large sums of money are still being wasted, as they are earmarked for measures that directly and indirectly attack the family and those who are weakest and poorest. It is reprehensible to treat poor persons and backward regions as though they were objects, by means of showy and sham aid measures aimed at broadening the spheres of influence of the modern superpowers. It is shameful to enslave poor countries by means of usurious financial systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the following teachings of the Holy Father John Paul II should be an inspiration and source of strength to us in the fight against world hunger and poverty; ‘millions of our brothers and sisters are suffering from hunger, and many are dying of it, especially children. In an age of unprecedented technological development, the tragedy of starvation is a great challenge and a great indictment. After all, the earth has enough resources to feed all of humankind. Why then are millions of people dying of starvation today? What is needed is a serious and worldwide examination of conscience regarding social justice and basic human solidarity. We would do well to remember the basic truth that the earth belongs to God, and all the riches it contains have been placed by God in man’s hands to use in a just fashion, so they can serve the good of all. The very law of nature bears testimony to this. Our common cry for bread on behalf of all who are suffering from hunger must not fail to be heard. We address it first of all to God, but we also address it to the politicians and economists, upon whom rests the responsibility for a just distribution of goods, on both a global and a national level. We must finally put an end to the scourge of hunger. May solidarity prevail over the unrestrained desire for profit. Upon each one of us there rests a small part of the responsibility for this injustice. Each one of us in some way has first-hand experience of the hunger and poverty of others. Let us learn to share our bread with those who have none’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in the light of these teachings by the Pope we must revise our current political activities, all the more so because the problem of hunger is affecting an ever increasing number of citizens of the European Union. More than five million people in Poland are already living in extreme poverty. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, while we are discussing poverty in the world, I should like to draw attention to the central thrust of World Poverty Day, which we are commemorating on 17 October. In those places where people are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are being violated. It is our sacred duty to unite in an effort to ensure that they are respected. The voices of the poorest should be heard everywhere where men and women take decisions on the future of humanity. Poverty today represents the greatest obstacle to women’s involvement in all aspects of life. International institutions, like the World Bank, for example, challenge us not to forget the fact that the first stage on the long road towards the liberation of women is the struggle against their poverty. The participation of women in determining the indicators for poverty is a basic prerequisite in this respect. The question arises as to whether we know how to develop the talents of poor people and to facilitate their access to fundamental rights. In order to measure and quantify poverty, we need precisely defined indicators. The traditional indicators have been roundly criticised by the American economist Gary Becker in his works on human capital and the economic approach to life. Becker in particular measured the effect of the gender gap in the field of income and the economic value of family life in all its forms. All this economic research shows that one third of the economic activities mainly undertaken by women are not subject to any form of evaluation or monitoring. There are simply no indicators or instruments for measuring them. Would it not be useful to take inspiration from the words of Gary Becker to define today a policy for a higher position in society for women? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even so, the European Union today contributes 55% of total development aid. Strengthening Europe’s role in the fight against poverty and in development aid enhances the credibility and effectiveness of the EU’s foreign, security and defence policies throughout the world. Europe can make a difference to hunger and poverty if it supports the initiatives of President Lula da Silva and Prime Minister Rodríguez Zapatero and also if it is able to mobilise funds and take the lead in projects with a strategic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">An example is the eradication of malaria, as recommended by the director of the United Nations Millennium Project, because malaria strikes above all at the poorest countries with devastating effect, causing incalculable economic damage. According to the WHO, malaria is the disease that causes most death and disability: more than a million people die each year, 90% of them in Africa. According to UNICEF, malaria kills a child every 30 seconds. Three children have died of malaria while I have been speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can do more and it can do better. The Commission must therefore launch and take the lead in a global anti-malaria campaign, increase funding and channel it into control programmes in the countries affected, support national policies prioritising malaria control, and encourage the private sector in vaccine production and the distribution of treatment drugs and impregnated mosquito nets.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty and misery feed injustice and despair, and these feed global insecurity. By committing to a malaria strategy, Europe will be making a decisive contribution to the Millennium Objectives, which are binding commitments, and also to a fairer and more secure world, the world that Europe’s citizens hope that the European Union will help to build. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk, we debate, we wring our hands. What we do not do is do something about it. Almost daily in this Parliament we talk about the Lisbon Agenda – competitiveness and growth leading to prosperity in Europe. We are slowly beginning to understand that you can only achieve that with healthy people. However, the low income countries of our world also need their own Lisbon agenda, and they need healthy people too.</p>
<p class="contents">Malnutrition means disease and disability. Disease means a reduced and ever less-productive workforce. That means poverty; and poverty means the inability to counter disease and hunger. That is the vicious circle that we have to break. That is what the Millenium Development Goals set out to do. That is what the World Food Summit set out to achieve. That is what the Declaration on Action Against Hunger and Poverty, once again, has declared. Even my own report in the ACP set it out yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 30 years of resolutions and 30 years of failure. The key is not food aid but food security. The former for emergencies, but the latter for long-term survival. The key is removing barriers to the imports of produce from low-income countries. The key is to ensure that our rightful concern with the tsunami-affected countries does not strip Africa of crucial aid. The key is to stress to President Bush - while he is here, in Europe - as well as to other Member States that aid is not an opportunity to reduce First World agricultural surpluses, but that he should buy local with aid money. If you cannot buy local, buy regional.</p>
<p class="contents">The key is to reinvest debt repayments in indebted nations to meet those millenium goals for hunger and disease. Only then can we give real hope to the 800 million of our fellow human beings who are undernourished. Then we will meet those food production targets, not globally but specifically in high-debt, low-income countries. That is what this motion sets out to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am one among many to say so, but I cannot help but be pleased. This debate also follows on from the initiative launched by the Quintet last September at the United Nations. Since then, many other voices have been heard on the same subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would remind you that no specific commitments have yet been made. Only four of the Member States of the European Union are currently meeting the commitment to devote 0.7% of their GDP to development aid. At the rate things are going, the Millennium Development Goals will not be reached in 2015. The problem of ending hunger and poverty is as old as the solutions being put forward to solve it: increasing the quality and quantity of development aid, cancelling and reducing debt, instituting a global tax on capital flows, and reforming international trade rules for fairer trade. In addition, all of the initiatives being put forward today must be in the form of additional resources devoted to development aid and can under no circumstances replace long-standing commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Myself, I will be keeping a close eye on these commitments and on this resolution, because only a firm political will can bring an end to this scourge. Hunger and poverty cannot be reduced to an ephemeral debate subject to the ups and downs of opportunistic media promotion or of charity, however well intentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted that a number of the new Member States have recently made significant increases in the budgetary funds they have earmarked for development policy. Yet the people of these countries know very little about development cooperation. Many people believe that aid consists exclusively of humanitarian aid. The noble impulses of the heart and people’s generosity whenever there are natural or humanitarian disasters are commendable, but it is important for people to understand that the elimination of extreme poverty and hunger is a strategic goal.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it would be worth alerting the citizens of the new Member States to the fact that the poverty that occurs in European countries is a different type of poverty to that which occurs in the poorest countries of the world. It is true that Poland is home to five million families who have to survive on the equivalent of EUR 2.5 per person per day, but EUR 2.5 in Poland is significantly more than EUR 2.5 in the poorest countries of the world. This is the case because the vast majority of men and women in Poland have access to water, electricity, gas, roads, education, health services and welfare. The difference between the technical and social infrastructure in the new EU Member States and in the poorest countries is much greater than it generally seems. Raising awareness of development cooperation in the new Member States is a task of such importance that not only the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, but also the governments of the Member States should commit themselves to accomplishing this task to the best of their abilities. I know that Commissioner Michel is aware of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is the country where immensely positive changes in the economic, political and social spheres came about as a result of the Solidarity movement and the implementation of the idea of solidarity, which began 25 years ago. Lech Wałęsa always said that people needed fishing poles, not just fish. At the same time as fighting hunger and extreme poverty throughout the world, we should never forget that local opportunities must be created, as well as providing emergency aid. This would enable those living in the poorest countries of the world to help themselves, and we would avoid the phenomenon described by researchers as the ‘modernisation of dependence’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I myself come from a Member State that is not high-ranking in this respect. Austria and Italy are at the bottom of the league table as far as ODA is concerned.

<p class="contents">I am pleased with what Commissioners Mandelson and Michel have said. I was recently in the Caribbean, meeting small farmers with tiny farms who cannot survive without access to the EU markets. We cannot rob those slightly less poor people to give to the poorest in the world; we have to have a just reform of the banana and sugar regimes. That will be a real test of our mettle.</p>

It is time now for action.</p>

Even if we are right, I wonder whether this debate is not obscuring the real issue, which is that before we discuss the amount of aid we grant, should we not first endeavour to improve the quality and effectiveness of existing aid? This question is all the more important because the discussions on international taxation or on the creation of international financing mechanisms will remain rather hypocritical, as long as the United States and the great majority of the international community will not accept these mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the amount of effort put into looking for new means, while we have still not achieved the objectives of the Monterrey Consensus, the priority given to improving the effectiveness of existing aid in order to achieve the Millennium objectives, and the scattering of resources and objectives in development policy all diminish the effectiveness of aid. We must be careful not to get involved in this headlong rush; we need to concentrate on looking for practical solutions that will allow us to meet our current commitments.

What factors supposedly make the EU the most suitable global player in relation to this issue? Rather, the EU has contributed to bringing about global problems of poverty through unfair trade rules and a protectionist agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst contributing economic resources in the form of development aid to poor countries, the European Union is preventing these countries from achieving growth through its bizarre agricultural and trade policies. This is inconsistent and not particularly credible. Many developing countries are more inclined to see the EU as the cause of their problems than as a solution to them. The UN, on the other hand, is an organisation more suited to combating poverty and hunger, having broader global support and more member states. In the EU, special national interests are still too dominant.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us fight together for a fairer world. The division of responsibilities between the EU and the UN could be as follows: the EU works on reforming its agricultural policy and attempts to bring about a fairer trade policy, whilst the UN provides a means for the countries of the world to channel financial and other aid to starving and suffering people. Let us avoid an unnecessary institutional power struggle in pursuing our common goal of eradicating poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this does the European Parliament great credit, and it has an important part to play in the European Union's development cooperation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are indeed times when we should get indignant. Mr Bowis quoted some figures that were horribly effective in showing that, behind the statistics, there are human beings who are suffering in this vicious circle of hunger and who are dying every day, every minute. A moment of indignation therefore does have its place. However, as someone said, this indignation must be followed by action. I must say that the European Union has nothing to be ashamed of in this respect either. I do not think that it needs to feel guilty: it is the largest donor of development aid. I also admit, though, that the aid we are giving is not enough. That is why we have set ourselves more ambitious objectives for those countries that are well below 0.7%. On the other hand, those that have achieved, or even exceeded, 0.7%, which, in the current budgetary climate, is still not easy, must remain on course.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth emphasising that, in the fight against hunger, against underdevelopment and against poverty, our approach cannot be anything other than global. That is why it is important to discuss methods of finance and why the commitments that have already been made must first of all be met. We need to find additional and alternative sources of finance. However, all of this will only be effective if this approach is part, as one speaker said, of a global approach that also takes trade issues into account. In this regard, I must also say that the European Union has not got everything wrong. True, there are problems with certain policies, and issues around agricultural policy have already been mentioned, but, in this area too, the European Union is probably the region whose markets are the most open to exports from developing countries. The previous Commission's initiative, or more specifically Pascal Lamy's initiative, called <span class="italic">Everything but arms</span>, is aimed at the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we need to build on what has already been achieved, which is not negligible. We also know, though, that the stakes are enormous and that time is short – we do not have decades in front of us – in an increasingly globalised world, and I think that Europe must not get the impression that it is sheltered from these problems, that it is just a spectator. We are at the same time a participant, by necessity, but we also feel the direct effects of this poverty. When thousands of people arrive on our shores on makeshift rafts, it is one of the consequences of extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we need to adopt a global approach; we now have to set up a monitoring system and we must not be afraid of saying, if need be, that the efforts made have not been adequate. I think that we in Europe are gradually going to put in place an even more effective policy in this field, which your Parliament considers to be extremely important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to quote the figures for the development assistance provided in 2003, for example, by the European Union – the world's largest donor, if we take the Commission and the Member States together. In that year, the total was EUR 32 billion. If the current trends are confirmed, we can assume that in 2006, it will amount to around EUR 46 billion. Of course, we must continue our efforts to achieve the UN target of 0.7% of GDP, but let us take a good look at these figures: from the Commission budget alone, the sum of EUR 7 billion is allocated to development every year.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right in one respect. As Mr Yañez-Barnuevo has said, trade and other mechanisms, as well as debt relief, are important, of course, and the issue of coherence therefore plays a key role here as well. We all know that the Doha Development Round and the WTO conference in Hong Kong are extremely significant in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently negotiating the Economic Partnership Agreements<span class="italic"> </span>with the ACP countries, and the focus here is on trade as well. Our aim is to further liberalise the developing countries' access to EU markets. At the same time, the Commission is keen to help the developing countries boost their own economies in future too so that they can benefit from the opening of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted that this morning, we spoke a great deal about human rights, the rule of law and good governance. This afternoon, by contrast, we have not mentioned them. Monterrey addresses this very issue: the fact that an appropriate approach must be adopted by both sides. The developing countries must uphold these principles too, for otherwise our money – and it is taxpayers' money – will simply be wasted.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Kaczmarek, the honourable Member from Poland, who will be informed of my comments even though he is unfortunately no longer in the Chamber – I say this: it is, of course, sad that there is poverty in Poland, but that is why the European Union has established the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds and it is up to the Polish Government to make appropriate use of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Martens, let me say that she is absolutely right. Until recently, I myself was not only the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria; I was also the State Secretary for Development Cooperation, and in my work, I always focussed on women, for they are a key development factor both within the family and in the economy as a whole. However, small and medium-sized enterprises are also extremely important for a bottom-up approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me reiterate that from our perspective, it is extremely important for the Millennium Development Goals to dictate the direction of development cooperation. The Commission will work very closely with your House in this context, and we hope it will be possible to adopt the millennium package on 22 March. The package comprises four communications: one cross-cutting, which describes our contribution to the UN Millennium Summit, and three others, each dealing with one aspect of our endeavours. Here too, we will undoubtedly have occasion to discuss the financing issue further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the recommendations of the UN High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, hunger and poverty along with the HIV epidemic and environmental degradation, constitute a threat to world security, over and above the traditional threats facing Humanity at present (eg terrorism). These threats are interrelated, and a threat to one is a threat to all.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Bank estimates that the September 11 attacks increased the number of people living in poverty by 10 million. Poverty, as measured by per capita GDP, is strongly related with the outbreak of civil wars: 12% probability when less than 1000USD and 2.5% when it reaches 4000USD.</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting the Millennium Development Goals and decisions taken in Johannesburg and Monterrey is the right direction. Reducing trade barriers, increasing development assistance and providing debt relief are obligations of the developed countries. It is true that not all Member States, particularly the newcomers, including my own, can meet the obligation of contributing the 0.7% of their national income. I urge the Council to take a collective decision on this issue so that every M.S presents a multiannual programme by which it commits itself to reach the 0.7% target and in the meantime the remaining to be complimented through the EU Budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘It is high time for action’, said President Chirac. ‘EU policy could provide a guarantee for a real breakthrough in the fight against poverty’.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the fundamental questions of the future is whether there are social interests and forces, in a world basically built on a market economy, which are able to mitigate poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU – both within and without its borders – must conduct a policy which can contribute to economic development and at the same time create provision for social security, as well as setting an example and spreading it to other regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With its aid policy the EU must contribute to:</p>
<p class="contents">– radically reducing hunger and severe poverty,</p>
<p class="contents">– making elementary education general in developing countries,</p>
<p class="contents">– increasing equality of opportunity for women,</p>
<p class="contents">– improving the quality of life through the broadening of public services and the creation of jobs,</p>
<p class="contents">and it would still be possible to add more items to this agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must also be committed to the fight against poverty in terms of ‘how too’: resources must be committed to economic development, democratic government must be promoted in those countries too, corruption must be pushed back, and there is a need for a fairer distribution of income and a significant growth in social and health services.</p>
<p class="contents">The French initiative – the imposition of a global tax – still has debatable elements, but we must move on this: it is unacceptable that more than a billion people in the world live on less than one dollar a day. ‘It is high time for action’ – I think so too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
