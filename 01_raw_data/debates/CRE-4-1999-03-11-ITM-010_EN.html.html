<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pronk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, I know that Mr Flynn cannot be here this evening because of an urgent appointment, although the report does, of course, come under his portfolio. But I am very pleased that Commissioner Monti is here, because I must admit that his work in this field was part of the inspiration for our report. There are certain parallels between the fields of social security and taxation, firstly because a substantial proportion of social security is paid for out of tax revenue, secondly because people often regard social security contributions as taxes, and thirdly, and most importantly, because under the Amsterdam Treaty both can only be changed by a unanimous decision. So it is good to see the laborious but constant progress that the Commissioner has made in the field of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Commission"s report on social security. The social security system was a response to the social question that arose at the end of the last century, and now, a century later, we can see that the problems associated with it have still not been resolved. However, social security has proved to be an important instrument for adapting the 19th century market economy to the needs of social justice. If we look at the figures we can see that, at 28.5 %, social security and social protection account for a considerable proportion of Europe"s GDP. Millions of people in the European Union depend on unemployment benefits, invalidity benefits, pensions and health‐care schemes. The Union"s prosperity has also advanced thanks to this comprehensive system which provides help in times of difficulty, need and crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Ministers delivered a recommendation in 1992 on the convergence of social protection objectives and policies, and I have therefore included a number of recommendations in my report to promote greater convergence. I call on the Commission to put forward an action plan which should include the following: the criteria for a benchmarking process in the area of social security; secondly, a code of conduct for avoiding harmful competition via social security systems; thirdly, precise figures for the economic damage arising from the evasion of social security contributions; fourthly, proposals for minimum standards based on the Amsterdam Treaty for certain areas of social protection; and fifth, the determination of a poverty line in order to establish an acceptable minimum income.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I would like to enlarge on. The first is the benchmarking process. Following the example of the European employment strategy – another successful element in the European Union"s social and economic policy – and the criteria for economic and monetary union, comparisons must be made between the Member States. Benchmarking can help the Member States to make decisions in order to develop a sound and decent social protection system, particularly now when a number of factors are placing increasing pressure on the system, such as the growth in the number of people of retirement age and the number of one‐person households. Both of these groups tend to be very dependent on the social security system.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to enlarge on is the idea of producing figures on the economic damage arising from the evasion of social security contributions. In my view, this is something that is often sidelined as unimportant and therefore negligible, and people tend to think that only small sums are involved. Yet I have never seen any figures to prove this scientifically. The evasion of contribution payments affects something else on which the European social model stands or falls, and that is solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not have much time left, and social security is something we could talk about at length. I know that there are a number of others who wish to speak in this debate. I would like to thank everyone for enabling us to reach a consensus, and I hope that this report will be adopted. Above all, I hope that the Commission will be able to use it to produce a policy for convergence.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Weiler </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me at the start of this debate to express my regret at the resignation a few hours ago of the German Finance Minister. I am saying this in the context of the present discussion, because in Oskar Lafontaine we had found a comrade‐in‐arms, one of the few European politicians who was far‐sighted enough to recognise and defend the European dimension at all times. You especially, Commissioner Monti, will understand my response to this news, because Mr Lafontaine had begun to implement the proposal you made quite some time ago on the reduction of non‐wage labour costs as a means of making labour a less expensive production factor.</p>
<p class="contents">Many aspects of social protection in Europe, of course, are still not given nearly enough consideration in terms of their European dimension in many Member States. Politicians are still far happier to discuss them in the small provincial forum of national politics and fail to realise that the people of our countries, the workforce, have long come to expect European action too in this domain. The Socialist Group supports Mr Pronk's report, partly because it provides good continuity from the first two reports which we adopted here in the Chamber and for which I had the pleasure of doing the preparatory work and formulating the conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it right and proper that Mr Pronk has not endorsed everything the Commission has proposed, since there were certainly some points in the report of which we were highly critical in the committee. I shall only mention one of the proposals which I believe is unacceptable in its present form: in connection with the need to cut health service costs, you have proposed more direct contributions by patients towards the cost of services. I believe that would be a very one‐sided perspective, and we shall naturally be unable to adopt everything as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk dealt with several areas in detail. I intend to confine myself to a few points that seem to me to be very important, such as proposals on a flexible transition to retirement and consultation between management and labour on such matters. In many Member States, employers have been far too ready to discard older workers by means of systematic early retirement. That will certainly have to be made more flexible. In addition, we shall have to pay more serious attention than has been given in the past to the need for women to be accorded equal rights within the social security system, and we have supplemented the report in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support Mr Pronk's proposals because, with his Dutch regard for consensus, if I may say that, he has adopted demands that we in the PSE Group made in various areas where we expect specific aims, specific measures and above all directives and action programmes from the Commission. It is not enough, now that we have the third communication – fine and good and important though it may be – to produce more new communications. We need quite specific legislative proposals, including proposals based on Articles 13 and 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Commission also has our support in the negotiations, in the struggle with the Council of Ministers. They know that Parliament expects more than communications. We also expect tangible qualitative progress.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been submitted in the framework of the dialogue between European management and labour is not enough for us either, not even the latest results, which still fall far short of the expectations of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take up one final point made by Mr Pronk. At the end of his speech, he referred to solidarity and to the evasion of welfare contributions in our systems. We must not forget that employers are by far the main culprits when it comes to the evasion of welfare contributions, as any of us who have looked behind the scenes will know. Public opinion, unfortunately, has a highly distorted view of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know about the economic benefits of the single market, which are becoming increasingly obvious. But what we lack is social protection at the European level. Social security is not a relic from the past but the model for the future, a model through which the people of Europe can begin once more to trust and accept the European institutions.</p>

I emphatically welcome the proposed action plan. May I say to Mrs Weiler that her contribution has demonstrated the broad cross‐party consensus that exists within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. But I should also like to say that while I do not, of course, entirely share her regret at the resignation of Mr Lafontaine, I do freely admit that there is now a danger that the labour wing of the German Social Democratic Party will face difficult times as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that the preservation of peace within European society crucially depends on social security. All Member States must launch additional efforts to increase employment. Besides unemployment, demographic development is also a major burden on the welfare state. In the face of this pressure, the principle of social solidarity must not be sacrificed under any circumstances. I fully agree with the rapporteur on that point. We must try to increase the activity rate. That applies to women, but it also applies to our senior citizens who, as you said, Mrs Weiler, suffer discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The burden of statutory non‐wage labour costs, particularly in the service sector, must be reduced. At the same time, the reduction process must not lead to distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Atypical forms of work present another problem. It is high time an appropriate level of social protection was created at European level for those whose work does not fit into the usual pattern. Without intensive cooperation among the Member States, there will be no progress on social protection and employment. At the same time, it is especially important to exclude any scope for social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressure must be exerted to obtain further progress towards the equal treatment of men and women. Gradual convergence of the national welfare systems must be pursued, with due regard for the subsidiarity principle. The development of supplementary pension schemes, based on the formation of coverage capital, must be subject to strict safeguards to protect employees from fraud and loss of pension rights. The compulsory systems must not be eroded and put at risk. Before the European Union is enlarged, the applicant countries must redefine and improve the criteria for the convergence of their welfare systems so as to avoid unforeseen consequences for the entire EU. The emigration of young, well‐qualified specialists could set back the applicant countries' economies by several years, as well as wreaking havoc on the labour markets of the established Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but by no means least, let me say quite emphatically that, within the framework of social solidarity, the European model must come up with sound solutions in terms of the creation of pro‐family employment strategies. At the same time, we must never forget that, in addition to childcare, consideration must also be given to the ever‐increasing need for employees to care for elderly parents and other dependent family members.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Boogerd‐Quaak </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Pronk report contains a whole raft of measures which we really need to take, and the convergence of social security and taxation is becoming a particularly important issue, partly as a result of the introduction of the euro. But the actual situation in reality is quite different, with the Member States still creating obstacles to prevent people from working in other countries. One current example is Germany, where there are tax obstacles that make it very difficult for foreign companies to take work in Germany. The staff of such companies have to pay regular taxes, which I think is extremely strange, and it is something that Mr Lafontaine has failed to tackle. My own country, the Netherlands, also knows a bit about this sort of thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The review of the taxation agreement between Belgium and the Netherlands places an enormous financial burden on Dutch frontier workers. As long as we have these huge differences in tax and social security and we still get up to all kinds of tricks when it comes to recognising diplomas and certificates, a great many job opportunities will be lost in border areas, both now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example is the lack of policy coordination on supplementary pensions, both on the question of deductibility and on tax on the eventual payments. This is a major obstacle to the free movement of workers, and I am therefore very pleased that Commissioner Monti announced this week that he is to put forward a proposal very shortly to deal with these problems. I have always welcomed his proposals in this field, and I hope that the Council will act upon them.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning in our discussion of the annual economic report for 1999, I called for greater international mobility of labour. This will become increasingly important over the next few years, since EMU means that unemployment can no longer be tackled with monetary measures alone. Labour mobility is needed as an adaptation mechanism for tackling regional unemployment in the Member States. But we must not allow social security discrepancies to prevent this mobility from happening. We therefore need to work together to achieve convergence in this field, both on social security and on taxation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hermange </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, this morning, a French newspaper ran the headline ‘Social Europe stumbles". Indeed, it is true that there is still a great deal to be done in the context of the single market and the single currency to ensure that social protection is not the variable used for adjustment to the detriment of workers, and that the Union"s companies are not subjected to unfair competition through widespread social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is true that if social Europe is stumbling, it is because we do not have sufficient legal bases. This is the reason behind the determination of politicians such as Bartho Pronk, who is making every effort to bring about a social Europe, and his report today is proof of that.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, the President of the Republic pointed out in his speech to the national parliament that as well as a European civilisation, there is a European social model, which cannot be separated from European citizenship. That is why we must constantly defend this European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that I completely support the rapporteur"s objective of establishing a certain degree of social convergence in Europe, not through standardisation, but through increased cooperation between the Member States on social matters. I also support Bartho Pronk"s request for minimum European standards for certain social provisions, as well as a structured process of voluntary consultation at European level on the objectives and policies related to social protection, especially as regards the European employment strategy that was adopted at the Luxembourg summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that adopting guidelines on social matters would genuinely encourage our governments to seek a productive and essential balance between solidarity and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have just celebrated Women"s Day, I would like to emphasise an important element for the many women who work, that is, reconciling their family and professional lives. Obviously, this not only affects women, but also children. In this respect, the report calls on the Council to include specific objectives in the guidelines on social policy to develop child‐care structures as well as facilities for relatives who require a certain level of care.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like us to be able to include this dimension of social protection in the social policy that is to be defined by Parliament. I am aware that certain politicians are not in favour of this. I would like to quote these words from a German socialist Minister, who was speaking about the Treaty of Amsterdam: ‘So many difficult compromises have been hammered out that it is not very glamorous for a Prime Minister to go back home and tell his people that he has managed to negotiate measures on child policy". This is an outrageous thing to say, and in my view child policy is also part of the social protection we owe our citizens.</p>

A few aspects of social security and a social system founded on solidarity which are important, indeed crucial, to me are stated at the outset, namely that everyone must assume responsibility and contribute in a spirit of solidarity to basic social security. Even though private supplementary insurance may be both right and important as an element in the adjustment of our social insurance systems, which are suffering under the strain of increasing numbers of elderly people in the population, it must not be allowed to undermine our common responsibility, with the result that we end up with different levels of health care – we hear shocking stories of such situations in countries like the USA. We must instead safeguard the principle of common responsibility and maintain a social system based on solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment costs a great deal of money and puts severe stress on social expenditure. For that reason, it is important as part of our social security to ensure that more jobs are created. A factor involved here is the need to bring down tax on labour, which is something that Mr Pronk also takes up.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market has of course increased the need for cooperation and coordination in the field of social security. There is also a need for a code of conduct on illegal competition with inferior social provisions – what we are accustomed to call social dumping. There is a need for minimum levels of security of employment, which should include the proliferation of atypical forms of employment which are now appearing. We must however also remember that, when we speak of social convergence, it is a voluntary adjustment, a coordination of aims and strategies, which is required. It is to a large extent a question of mutual recognition of social security provisions, employment insurance schemes, pension systems and so on, which is also important in the context of freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">With the new proposal which the Commission has put forward, on which I have been asked to draw up Parliament's report, protection is also extended to citizens of third countries, frontier workers, students and so forth, which is entirely the right way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report takes up discrimination and social exclusion. The resolve to devise a coherent plan to tackle this as soon as possible and to reduce the number of socially excluded and poor people in Europe is really something that we in the Green Group support.</p>

All of these things must be included in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">These days, the Member States are making very considerable efforts to provide social protection, but because society is changing and ageing, because so many women now have jobs outside the home, because there are one‐parent families and so on, there are more and more new things that social protection does not cover. I would urge that our view of the responsibilities in this field should not be too dogmatic, but that we should at least grant the same social rights which should also be available to those in unpaid work.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is obvious that we need a European social pillar. Cooperation between the Member States needs to be stepped up as a result of EMU and the European employment strategy. There must be a social safety net for everyone. We do not actually have much time left, because convergence on social protection is urgently needed. I would call for entirely practical measures to be taken, as Mr Pronk does in his report and the Social Affairs Committee does as well. The current differences in the cost of social protection distort competition between the Member States and thus threaten employment. I would like to mention just one example of the many I could quote. Renault"s departure from Flanders has caused great bitterness. We need minimum standards for social security and pay if we are to have a genuinely social Europe. But this in itself is not a solution for countries with a very highly developed and expensive social security system based on general solidarity, which has a considerable effect on the cost of labour. We do not want social security in such countries to disintegrate, but it is clear that an effective employment policy must remain the basis of the system throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There should not be employment in some countries with little social protection and unemployment in countries with a high level of social protection. No, thank you. Convergence is what we need, and the sooner the better!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindqvist </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, perhaps I take a rather different view from the rest of you, not so much on the matter itself as on the place where matters should be dealt with. Questions of welfare, relationships between children and parents and between the generations, education, social security, and dental and medical care are, first and foremost, national issues. There is no reason to harmonise them or to regulate them in detail at EU level. On the other hand, there are sound reasons for the mutual recognition of different systems, so that people who move from one country to another can avail themselves of their social benefits in the new country. In this area, there are many deficiencies and a great deal to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important question at EU level in my view is employment. But in that area the EU has failed! When Sweden applied for membership 10 years ago, in 1990, we had unemployment running at 2.3 %. Today the figure matches the EU average, 10 to 12 %. There are immigrant areas in Sweden which, ten years ago, had an unemployment rate of 50 %; the current rate is 75 %, perhaps even 90 %. I am not saying that it is the EU's or anyone else's fault, but I am saying that we have failed to solve the most serious social problem, which is hitting vulnerable groups unable to do much about that reality – children and unemployed people who have nothing to live on – particularly hard.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has paid too much attention to the economy, markets, trade and competition. It was important to do that, but there was not always the same concern to consider the consequences. The project that overshadows everything is EMU, which has been very costly in terms of economy plans, cutbacks and increased unemployment. We now have 18 million unemployed and 50 million people in poverty. That is far too many!</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from unemployment, social questions to which the EU should give priority are the major problems concerning the shaping of public opinion to combat discrimination against groups such as immigrants, women and the unemployed, trafficking in human beings and the fight against drugs. In this area, there is any amount of work to be done. Here too, the approach should be to give advice, direction and support to the Member States through common guidelines at EU level, but to leave the implementation of decisions to the national level.</p>
<p class="contents">EU cooperation in the social field should concentrate on the following four areas: jobs and unemployment, reducing exclusion and poverty, curbing discrimination and social dumping, and strengthening equality.</p>

There are good reasons why political action is so obviously required in this area. The introduction of the euro has undoubtedly had an impact on wage policies and hence on social protection in the various Member States. At the same time, despite a high level of economic activity, Europe is struggling to cope with a vast army of unemployed. This means that welfare systems have been subject to increasing demand, while the funds allocated to them have been increasingly restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Our finance ministers, as you all know, have to operate with tight budgets, and increasing taxes would only harm Europe's international standing as a business location. Against this background, the common aim of all the efforts to reform welfare systems must be to safeguard the effectiveness of the system in the long term, while structuring it in such a way – and let me stress this point – that it promotes economic growth and the creation of new jobs, instead of stifling them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Let me start by thanking Mr Pronk for his excellent report and for his generous words which I personally welcome for two reasons. The objective, namely tax coordination to which he made reference, does not aim simply at improving the single market but has also a social objective in making tax systems more labour‐friendly. In the instruments there are indeed striking similarities between what has been devised to fight harmful tax competition and what the rapporteur is proposing in terms of a code of conduct for avoiding harmful competition via social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk has taken the opportunity arising from the publication of the report on social protection for 1997, presented by the Commission at the initiative and under the guidance of Commissioner Flynn to open up a debate in Parliament on the future challenges facing Europe's social protection systems. This is valuable and also very timely, for reasons that I will come to.</p>
<p class="contents">I can state that the Commission welcomes the resolution that you are debating today. You are giving the right message at the right time. Europe is living through a period of change: change in the world of work, change in society and in family structures, technological change and a major demographic change. All Member States face these changes to a greater or lesser extent. We need new, innovative approaches if our social protection systems are to continue to perform their traditional and very important roles: income redistribution, building social cohesion, and providing security against social risks as they have done over the last fifty years.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1995 the Commission launched a debate on the future of social protection. The aim was to trigger a process of joint reflection to look together for solutions and to learn from each other. Not having been an initiator of this – it was Commissioner Flynn – I can say in retrospect, on a personal basis, that this was perhaps one of the very first examples of trying to achieve progress through comparison, through peer review, and similar processes, which I find very helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 the Commission took stock of this debate in its communication: Modernising and Improving Social Protection. The Commission's main message throughout this process has been that there is an urgent need to modernise social protection in the European Union. Modernising means adapting systems to the new social and economic conditions in which they operate. It does not mean abandoning the high ideals and important objectives which lie behind these systems. It means changing methods and approaches where necessary in order to ensure that we can continue to give our citizens the high levels of social protection that they want. At the same time we must ensure that our systems are sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">The important of a high level of social protection was underlined in the reactions to the 1997 communication, in particular the resolution of the European Parliament, prepared by Mrs Weiler, and in the discussions on the European social policy forum. The process of rapid social, economic and political change goes on. At European level alone, since we launched our debate on modernising and improving social protection we can take note of the following: the Amsterdam Treaty has been adopted and will shortly come into force, incorporating a new chapter on employment and other relevant developments to do with social exclusion, non‐discrimination and public health. The European employment strategy has been successfully put into place and Member States have made a good start on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The single currency was introduced in January. Enlargement negotiations have been launched with five countries in Central and Eastern Europe. It is important to recognise that these developments will impact on both Member States' social protection systems and our ways of cooperating at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The time is ripe to take the process of joint reflection on the future of our social protection systems a step further. The proposals made in Parliament's resolution go in the right direction. You clearly support what is a central theme in this process – the need to work together closely and the great benefits that can flow from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Social protection policy is a matter for which Member States have responsibility. There are considerable differences between the systems of the 15 Member States. Nevertheless we are facing common problems and challenges. We have common objectives. All of us have much to gain from a common reflection. You also send a clear message to the Commission and the Member States to be ambitious in this process. The Commission will keep these views very much in mind when we come back with our proposals on how to take forward these ideas on social protection. We will be issuing a new and ambitious communication in the next few months. Your resolution is a timely input in that regard that we value very much.</p>
