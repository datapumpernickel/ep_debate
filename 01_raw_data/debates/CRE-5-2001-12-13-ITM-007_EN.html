<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, the fisheries protocol with the Republic of Mauritania is of vital importance for EU fisheries. The previous protocol expired on 31 July 2001. This new protocol was initialled by both parties on 31 July 2001, fixing for five years the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Mauritania during the period 1 August 2001 to the end of July 2006. The provisional application of this protocol will depend on the first payment being made before 31 December this year. It is therefore of the utmost importance that Parliament delivers a favourable opinion this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that in 1995, following the unilateral termination by Morocco of the fisheries agreement concluded in May 1992 for a period of four years and in view of the likely problems of negotiating a new agreement with Morocco, the Commission initiated negotiations with third countries so that vessels prevented from fishing as a result of any loss of fishing opportunities off Morocco could, if necessary, be moved elsewhere. As a result, a supplement to the 1993-1996 protocol with Mauritania was adopted which aimed to offset the loss of fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in Morocco by allowing for 18 Spanish vessels to transfer to the waters of Mauritania, a geographical area close to where they operated previously.</p>
<p class="contents">In remarkably similar circumstances, the failure to renew the last agreement with Morocco, which expired at the end of November 1999, has again led to the need to seek increased fishing opportunities elsewhere in order to offset some of the hardship caused by the loss of access to Moroccan waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The protocol before Parliament today reflects this need. It allows for increased opportunities for EU vessels, while at the same time providing for greatly improved financial compensation for Mauritania – and I will deal with that later.</p>
<p class="contents">This new protocol with Mauritania is now the Union's most important protocol with a third country. Overall, the protocol offers allocated fishing rights for various species, or category of vessel, to Spain, Italy, Portugal and France. If licence applications from these Member States do not cover all the fishing opportunities fixed by the protocol, the Commission may take into consideration licence applications from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The table in my report compares the fishing possibilities offered by the protocol under review with those available under previous agreements. From this table, you will see that, although there has been an overall increase over previous protocols, there has been a reduction for a number of stocks. There will be a 30% increase in the number of vessels, which averaged 42 under the previous protocol, to 55. According to the Commission, this measure was possible because opportunities had been created by the departure by a number of Far East vessels which used to target particular species.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a 17% increase in the number of tuna vessels, from 57 to 67. The tonnage for vessels targeting black hake will remain the same at 8 500 GRT. For those targeting crustaceans other than crawfish (shrimps and crabs), the tonnage will go up by 9% from 5 500 to 6 000 GRT. However, it is important to note that there has been a reduction in the number of pelagic vessels permitted from 22 to 15. The total Community financial contribution will be EUR 430 million, broken down into EUR 86 million per year for the period of the application of the protocol. The EUR 86 million for the year comprises EUR 82 million in financial compensation and EUR 4 million for the financial contributions to fund the various types of fisheries-related assistance set out in Article 5 of the protocol. The government of Mauritania has full discretion regarding the use to which the financial compensation element is put.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, this new protocol with Mauritania is obviously of key significance. In this regard, it must be stressed that its principal importance does not lie in the scale of fishing possibilities that it offers or indeed in its cost.</p>
<p class="contents">From a Community fisheries and socio-economic point of view, its real interest is the hope which it holds out to people of the fisheries-dependent regions of Spain and Portugal, such as Andalucia, the Canary Islands, Galicia and the Portuguese south. These regions, which had so much invested in the Moroccan agreement, must be offered real alternatives as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to make three brief observations in this respect. The first one relates to the economic and social importance of these agreements for the European Union. As is well known, these fishing agreements with third countries account for 25% of the supply of the Community market and represent around 50 000 jobs. It has been proved, as in the case of the Efremer study, that they are highly advantageous for the European economy. The second observation concerns the importance of the agreements for the economy of the developing countries. Clearly, the European Union cannot paternalistically and high-handedly impose a decision regarding the sectors to which compensation should be applied but, little by little and with diplomacy, we have reached a situation where part of this financial compensation is applied in the fisheries sector and in important activities. Thirdly, it is clear that these fishing agreements are of mutual benefit for the two parties, for both the European Union and the third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer to the Gallagher report, since the agreement with Mauritania is the most important one concluded with third countries to date. In the light of the non-renewal of the agreement with Morocco, this agreement with Mauritania, as the rapporteur stated, is now of special importance for Portugal and Spain, but also for Italy and France, which are countries that also fish in these waters.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Committee on Fisheries adopted an amendment proposing that the quotas be redistributed by the countries in the event that those for whom they are intended do not use them. I must say that my group agrees with this principle provided that it is applied from now on, of course, to all fishing agreements and not only the agreements with ACP countries. Lastly, I would like to thank Mr Gallagher for the excellent work he has done in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As previous speakers have said, it is one of the so-called Southern agreements, an agreement under which shipowners contribute to the economic costs by paying for licences. As you know, in the Northern agreements, the shipowners do not pay.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur says in his report, four Southern States (Spain, Italy, Portugal and France) are going to be the beneficiaries of this new five-year protocol, although it is also the case that, if fishing opportunities are not utilised – as the rapporteur says – other European countries can use them, which is also something which happens in Southern agreements, but not in Northern agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As always, I would like to stress to the Members of this House – and not only those of the Committee on Fisheries – the importance of fisheries agreements with third countries, the importance of continuing to sign up to them and to sign up to new ones. I stress their importance for those third countries and for European regions which are highly dependent on fishing such as my own, Galicia, and I stress once again that this agreement is mutually beneficial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been assured by Commission officials that negotiations for third country fisheries agreements are based on information provided by this committee. Regarding the most recent stock assessment of octopus in Mauritania, the report says "... the assessment conducted in 1998 indicates that the stock was over-exploited..." and it then goes on to say that "... the 1998 working group in Nouadhibou recommended a reduction of 25% of the fishing effort exerted by the cephalopod fisheries...". This is a far cry from a scientific endorsement of increasing European fishing of octopus even if certain other fleets have reduced their effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission states that there was a more recent assessment by Spanish scientists. However, despite repeated requests, Commission officials have so far failed to provide a copy of this document. I believe there is an important principle here in relation to access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, which is the budgetary authority, is being frustrated in its attempts to obtain the relevant scientific information on this major third country agreement. I cannot understand how the Commission can go for a study by anonymous authors and ignore information provided by its own main committee. Parliament has a right to know.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I wish to make relates to the clause which appears to facilitate the Atlantic Dawn. I am curious. I congratulate the Commission on taking legal action against the Atlantic Dawn, but I would now like to hear from the Commission the latest on this case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is yet another example of the EU taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries. The bribe of EUR 86 million per annum is taken from many pensioners and many of the lower-paid. It is given directly to the ruling elite of Mauritania, who are ethnically different from the bulk of the ordinary people. Very little money filters down to the ordinary people who are amongst the poorest in the world in one of the poorest regions of the world. Furthermore, it is destroying fish stocks and destroying such infrastructure as exists. Worst of all, however, hundreds of local fishermen are being killed each year and, if the excellent Channel 4 documentary on the Mauritanian agreement is any guide, some are being deliberately run down by trawlers engaged in illegal fishing permitted by a deliberately lax, ill-equipped monitoring and enforcement regime.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reality. For all the fine words in the Commission document, this agreement is creating a human and environmental disaster. It is set to continue – and why? To satisfy the insatiable greed of the largely Spanish fishing industry, which nobody dares to oppose for fear of reprisals at the Council of Ministers. A vote for this report is effectively a vote to subsidise murder and it creates the very conditions in which terrorism is spawned.</p>
<p class="contents">This serious issue needs to be investigated and therefore I challenge this House to support me in the call for a temporary committee of enquiry, the papers of which will be ready for the next Strasbourg session. If, as we say, we care about the poor and oppressed, if we believe in the right to life, then this House should support me in attempting to shine a light on this disgraceful situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, on the diligence and efficiency with which he has done his work. He well understood that this was an urgent report, given the situation of the fleet affected by the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco. A part of that fleet can now be included in the agreement with Mauritania, which will help to relieve the difficult situation which had been created. The European Parliament is thereby giving its opinion on the Gallagher report on this agreement, which is essential to the European Union, in record time.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is fair to congratulate the Commission on having reached this agreement, which breaks the curse of the failure of the negotiations with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out – because there has been false and ill-intentioned information on this agreement – that the agreement with Mauritania is very beneficial for both parties. I insist; for both parties, and that is why it has been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that there is no better defender in the world of cooperation development or of the conservation of resources than the European Union. Therefore, neither private agreements nor public agreements with States other than the European Union, above all Asian States, can in any way be compared with the control and rigour applied by the European Union in these international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, to condemn the recent seizure of a ship, the Lameiro Uno, which, while sailing towards Mauritanian waters, was seized by Morocco, accused of fishing, when this was not the case. Commissioner, I hope that this intolerable practice by Morocco will not be repeated in the future, since it would jeopardise the achievements of the fisheries agreement with Mauritania. I would ask you to take good note of this, in order to prevent any repetition of these practices, since vessels obviously have to pass through Morocco’s economic zone in order to reach Mauritania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Mr Gallagher, for your report on the proposal for a regulation on a new protocol to the fisheries agreement with Mauritania. I am delighted that you are in full agreement with the terms of this proposal setting out and safeguarding the facility for our fleet to fish in Mauritanian waters until May 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we have a history of good fisheries relations with Mauritania. Moreover, this agreement is now the Community's most comprehensive fisheries agreement and hence an important component of the Common Fisheries Policy. We signed the new protocol at the end of July after four rounds of intensive and tough negotiations and I think we really have brokered a fair agreement which benefits Mauritanian fishermen and the Mauritanian sector as well as our own fishermen, while guaranteeing sustainable stock management.</p>
<p class="contents">I really must say, Mr Farage, that you would be better advised to base your comments on fact than political posturing. So what exactly is the truth? The truth is that we have included a whole series of new measures in this agreement which were absent from earlier agreements. For example, some of the money goes directly towards improving scientific knowledge about resources. From now on, stocks will be regularly and scientifically monitored, and we have stipulated that, if the size of the stocks changes, then fishing opportunities must be adjusted accordingly, as must the relevant financial compensation. So it is quite untrue to say that we simply continue to fish the maximum catches, irrespective of how stocks develop. That is the reality. Secondly, we have based fishing rights on the data available, which Mauritania provided. According to the data which we received, it was possible at the present time to agree on a slight increase in fishing opportunities for cephalopods.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to point out that this is not the lion's share of the agreement. The lion's share – around 40% – of catches under this agreement is accounted for by demersal species. And, just for the record, they do not mainly benefit Spain, as you maintain, they mainly benefit the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the agreement contains a series of terms allowing for the sustainable management of Mauritanian fish stocks and the development of the local economy. In order to protect local inshore fishing, we have moved the fishing areas for the Community fleet further away from the coast than was previously the case. In order to help the local economy and create jobs in the country itself, we have agreed that demersal fish trawlers must now land a larger proportion of their catches in Mauritania.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, more Mauritanian seamen will be taken on board EU ships in future. Catch monitoring and controls have been strengthened and we have also increased the amount for so-called targeted actions significantly, by a total of EUR 20 million for the term of the agreement. These flanking measures will help alleviate the concerns expressed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the proposed amendments, we have absolutely no objection to Amendment Nos 1, 3 and 5. In any case, these demands are already met under the interinstitutional agreements and, more importantly, under the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission of 5 July 2000, making these amendments superfluous. We have a problem with Amendment Nos 2, 4 and 6 and cannot therefore agree to them. As far as Amendment No 2 is concerned, the principle of non-discrimination is already laid down in the founding treaty of the European Union and there is therefore no sense in including this sort of clause. As far as Amendment No 4 is concerned, I should point out that our standard practice is that no new mandate is required for a protocol extending a fisheries agreement. As for Amendment No 6, mixed funding for negotiated fishing opportunities is part and parcel of our external fisheries policy. In the case of agreements with third countries, the cost of compensation is footed by the Community budget, with shipowners paying for the licences.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also take this opportunity of pointing out that the sum quoted in the amendments is incorrect and that, from a purely formal point of view, the amendment should refer to the protocol.</p>
