The reasons in brief, are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendments Nos 1 and 10 on predicate offences, the Commission cannot accept coverage essentially limited to organised crime. On the treatment of the professions covered by Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 and 22, the Commission considers that the legal professions are a special case deserving special treatment. It is unwilling, however, to extend that same treatment to all the professions. It also believes that certain types of advice, not covered by legal privilege, should fall within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 7 and 11 on the competent authorities and Amendment No 9 on the definition of financial institutions, the Commission has a preference for the text of the common position. Amendment No 14 constitutes, in the Commission's view, an excessive extension of the coverage of non-financial activities. Regarding Amendments Nos 15 and 16 on client identification, the Commission is satisfied that the common position offers the necessary flexibility. Amendments Nos 17 and 28 deal with the special case of client identification where there is no face-to-face contact. While sympathetic to the objective of Amendment No 28, the Commission cannot accept these amendments as they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 18 calls for a revision of the exemptions from client identification for certain insurance contracts. The Commission believes a detailed study is needed prior to such revision. Amendments Nos 19 and 20 deal with identification in casinos. The Commission has a preference for the common position text dealing with this matter. The Commission believes that Amendments Nos 21 and 24 bridge the basic no tipping-off rule. Amendments Nos 23 and 25 amend provisions of the 1991 directive which, in the Commission's view, do not need to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendments Nos 26 and 27 refer to the role of OLAF. At the request of the Council, the Commission will table a separate proposal on this issue. The amendments are, therefore, unnecessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will explain why. Many of us in this House, probably all of us, want the neighbouring countries of Macedonia and Greece to reach agreement on the name – whether it is going to be FYROM or Macedonia. If a vote on this takes place today, I am afraid that it will not turn out positively, or at least with a very small majority, which would not be in line with what the proposers intended. I would therefore like to ask that this proposed amendment be withdrawn. The proposers’ feelings have been expressed, and these are the feelings of many of us in this House, but I believe that the amendment as it stands should not be presented today, especially since Greece and Macedonia/FYROM are on the brink of an agreement.</p>

Moreover, Macedonia has been declaring for the past ten years that it has no desire whatsoever to change its national borders. I therefore see no reason whatsoever why Macedonia could not choose its own name. In all honesty, I do not welcome the fact that the Greek Members of the large groups have, in my view, once again managed to hold their groups hostage. Having said that, it would be even worse if a majority of this Parliament were to declare that Macedonia should be denied this right. That is why I am prepared to withdraw the amendment now, but I would call on the Greek Members finally to face the truth and grant Macedonia the right to choose its own name.</p>

<p class="contents">We can support the rapporteur’s determination to pursue the development of the infrastructure needed by port installations at European level. European public finance for the development of public facilities, in order to achieve better land use, balance the means of transport more effectively, and fight pollution, is undoubtedly a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Public funding, however, must be for public facilities and public services. Now the ambiguity facing the European Union, which recurs in this report, revolves specifically around the future status, public or private, of port installations. On the one hand, the Council is promoting the trans-European networks, while on the other, it is planning privatisations in these sectors, as in the directive presented on 14 February on opening up competition for port services, for example. Europe never thinks about the needs of peoples and societies, only about opening up and competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, apart from one amendment, Amendment No 2, which extends the obligations of the directive to chartered accountants, and one other, Amendment No 27, which mentions OLAF and a possible European public prosecutor, Mr Lehne’s report does its best to reduce the scope of the directive. As he, himself, puts it: ‘the right of clients to confidentiality must not be undermined, even when the aim is to fight money laundering’. Absurd pretexts are then added to that argument (complicated and completely useless obligations), and escape clauses which allow the professional associations to establish the necessary rules themselves.</p>

In particular I recognise the importance of common standards and rules in helping to overcome the legal obstacles that can be put in place of successful prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland, in order to combat the types of crime mentioned in the debate, we established the ‘Criminal Assets Bureau’ (CAB) which is a multi-agency organisation, headed by a legal officer and a chief superintendent of the police. These have been very successful in seizing the assets of drug dealers and other criminals as well as gathering evidence for further prosecutions. This has worked to bring a lot of criminals to justice and to follow the money trail to seize the proceeds of those criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">However great our desire may be to prosecute criminals, we must ensure that the normal rules of procedure and justice are not ignored. In the present report, the desire to put accountants and auditors on the same level as lawyers is important to maintain this right of defence. The move within the common position to allow information gathered in a ‘money laundering case’ to be put to other uses for prosecution goes too far I believe.</p>

The war against money laundering can no longer be waged by an isolated government. For it to be effective, cooperation between the Member States must be organised. It is essential to extend the definition of money laundering, because restricting it to drug-trafficking no longer corresponds to today’s reality. Account must be taken of every type of crime that generates major financial flows, fraud against the financial interests of the Communities, and any kind of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It has become absolutely necessary to involve the legal professions in the operation against money laundering, otherwise the European system of preventing and combating dirty money will be ineffective. There is no question, however, of lawyers accepting any threat to professional secrecy or the confidentiality of their relationship with their clients. So those amendments are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, professional secrecy remains the fundamental rule in the exercise of the profession of lawyer. It is incompatible with the expression of suspicion, worse still, the expression of possible suspicion.

We had hoped that this new version would be pushed through in first reading. It now seems likely we will have to go through a mediation process, because we simply cannot accept the academic and impractical position adopted by the Finance Ministers, which Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs do not agree with either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to impose the transfer of existing money laundering rules for financial service providers lock, stock and barrel to all other professional groups such as lawyers and tax consultants and then insinuate that we simply wanted to protect the guild of lawyers. This is just not the case. It makes no sense that lawyers cannot settle an insurance claim or that brokers cannot draw up a plan until they have established their credentials.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes just as little sense to demand that cash only be handed over from person to person. Such a demand would mean that bank night safe-deposit boxes would have to be set up immediately. This would cause problems, however, for business people, especially from small and medium-sized businesses, who, for obvious reasons of security, deposit their day’s takings in the safe-deposit box of their bank after the banks have closed. That, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the laundering of money from criminal activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully endorse the reasonable position adopted by the rapporteur, which the Finance Ministers could also live with. They at least should know that any further delay in amending the money-laundering Directive is irresponsible, especially since the money-laundering mafia is becoming increasingly adept.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member of the European Parliament who comes from Luxembourg, the effectiveness of the fight against the laundering of money from criminal activity lies very close to my heart, as the Grand Duchy has some of the strictest laws on money laundering. These laws and their application as well as the cooperation resulting from the 1991 Directive must not be undermined by a too broadly interpreted definition of ‘criminal activity’, which is what is called for under the common position adopted by the Council. For reasons of efficiency, the directive should essentially be limited to combating the laundering of money from organised crime, which was its original objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their view is that the government should not interfere in their profits and possessions. Attempts are once again being made, rightly so, to get a tighter grip on money-laundering practices. On the one hand, that requires the proposed measures to be as fool proof as possible, without escape routes for profiteers who refuse to meet the legal requirements. I have the impression that the Council’s proposals are still too weak in this respect, and even the adjustments proposed by the rapporteur at second reading still leave something to be desired. On the other hand, there is the fear that lawyers have been required to act as investigation officials at the expense of their clients. In this case, this may be justified. Nonetheless, this sets an undesired precedent. Lawyers should not be required to act against those whom they have to protect. By, however, drawing a distinction in recital 16a between the actual role of lawyers and this profession’s other activities, it might be possible to avoid this precedent.

Money laundering is an unseen crime, but it costs the taxpayer dearly and those found guilty should pay the price. Those misusing the financial system should be caught and punished.

The compulsory definition of acceptable raw materials in compound feedingstuffs for animals is also crucial, bearing the BSE and dioxin crises in mind. We must also ensure that all materials that put human and animal health at risk are banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this report was framed during a broader discussion of animal feedingstuffs, on which the Commission made a statement regarding the options for encouraging the planting of protein crops in the EU, taking account of the Agricultural Council of December 2000, which bans the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, and insists on the need to replace animal protein with vegetable protein.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is based mainly on budgetary consequences, forgetting the basic principle of the sovereignty of food, when it states that the best and cheapest solution is to increase Community soya imports by 5%. This will make the EU more dependent for its vegetable protein, particularly soya meal, which could threaten food safety, on imports of genetically modified soya from the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the pretext of WTO rules and costs, the Commission is refusing to increase aid for growing oilseed crops because they contravene the Blair House agreement. Similarly it refuses to support the use of fallow land under the set-aside system, because this would be in conflict with the WTO’s blue box that requires agricultural aid to be conditional upon production-limiting measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the Commission is refusing to encourage production within the EU. This is an unacceptable position, which we should reject, although we support the report, for which we have voted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that, in times like these, it is a political imperative that we give people a feeling of security. We need openness, labelling and transparency. Politically mature citizens want to decide for themselves what to eat.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this demand cannot relate solely to the end product. So we have a fundamental interest in documenting the history of our food and making it transparent. Farmers on the ground are responsible for animal protection and food safety. They must be held accountable for what they feed to their animals, not only to secure their own economic success (though this is a factor we should not lose sight of) but also to satisfy consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at individual actions, I sometimes get the impression that time is running away from us. My own <span class="italic">land</span> in Germany, Rheinland-Pfalz, has introduced a seal of approval for beef which aims to guarantee not only the origin of the animal but its history and what it has been fed.</p>
<p class="contents">The feedingstuffs industry has come on board of its own free will and offers an open declaration of feed materials and stronger controls. Farmers would otherwise buy their feed elsewhere: only with this information can they get the seal of approval. I hope in future there will be more such self-imposed obligations. This would set the wheel in motion and feedingstuff manufacturers would be practically forced to make an open declaration out of economic necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the here and now, however, it is a question of taking a political decision and establishing the legal bases, which must be the same for everybody. That is why we need the open declaration. We need traceability and we also need controls. I hope that the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf will set the wheel turning.

<p class="contents">Recital 14 and Article 4 provide for the possibility of government aid being deployed for the use of infrastructure. This is also possible pursuant to the amendments. In my opinion, this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all because the starting premise is wrong, for transport by road already pays the lion’s share of the external costs. Secondly, it is not judicious to grant extra support for the use of infrastructure. Take rail, for example: the costs are not the most important reason why transporters do not opt for rail. We need an increase in quality and reliability, and market discipline is then the best incentive. I fear that this incentive for a modal shift, of which we are of course in favour, is counterproductive, brings about distortion of competition and undermines the work that has been done in the framework of the rail liberalisation package.</p>

<p class="contents">With the expansion of the single market and with the introduction of the euro currency, there are now greater opportunities for cross-border trade and commerce in Europe. Also, with the wider globalisation of the marketplace, there is a necessity for a greater co-operation and understanding of different legal systems. In any democratic system, the arm of justice must not only operate effectively but must be seen to do so and it must command the respect of the people. The quicker and easier it is for the resolution of legal conflicts, then the better it is for the protection of legal rights and also to guarantee the conditions concerning the certainty of trade. Therefore, the setting up of the EUROJUST programme with the co-operation of the judiciaries within the various EU Member States is a very important movement towards building a greater understanding of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this should not be seen as an attempt to subvert or subjugate the systems operating within the various Member States of the EU. Rather, it should be seen as an enhancement to implementing a speedy resolution of disputes by introducing a greater clarity in legal judgements.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly recommend the point in relation to the establishment of a centralised electronic European Union judgment registry, which has been initiated by an Irish lawyer Twinkle Egan. This will make it easier to understand differing judgements and to help build a greater consistency in how precedents operate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully support this common-sense strategy which broadens the system of cooperation between national authorities. This will not only simplify judicial cooperation between the Member States, but it will also facilitate cross-border legal procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased judicial cooperation is an important step forward for my constituents in the North-West who are sometimes desperate for help with a case in another EU country. For example, a young parent whose children have been abducted by the other parent from the UK to France, will certainly be assisted by greater understanding between the British and French legal services. So would the elderly couple who have exchanged their hard-earned cash for a holiday home in the south of Spain and have faced legal battles with the purchase.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that this network becomes part of the existing trans-European network for the electronic exchange of data. In light of enlargement, the applicant countries should also be allowed to participate in the contact meetings. Data will therefore be exchanged on the European judicial network from England to Estonia, making life remarkably easier for the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I very much welcome increased judicial cooperation which will be of tremendous benefit to all our citizens seeking legal advice or bringing forward cases across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Reading the Commission’s report on vegetable proteins in the context of the ban on meat and bone meal, I was deeply shocked by the authors’ apparent contempt for their fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">First, contempt for consumers: the Commission’s position takes no account of the clear, strong and growing demand on the part of consumers for traceability and visibility in product origin. Here the proposal is simply to go on buying the proteins we lack as cheaply as possible in the great world supermarket for agricultural surpluses. So what if they contain GMOs?</p>
<p class="contents">Then, contempt for farmers: the Commission’s resignation is an insult to European farmers, suggesting they are incapable of producing the vegetable proteins we need on our own soil. The measures proposed in the Commission’s seven- point plan (authorising the production of fodder legumes on land set aside on organic farms) is sympathetic but in no way commensurate with the challenge. Between organic production and massive imports of genetically modified soya, there is a margin for the creativity of European farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact one could say the Commission is trying to find technical, regulatory and budgetary arguments for refusing to act. It is presenting us with a ‘non-plan’ for proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is demonstrating an accountant’s logic which is not even economically relevant: the fact that soya is cheap at the moment does not mean it will always be cheap. A price rise is bound to come.</p>

The Commission’s proposal was one-sided and limited and sought to make it possible, only for organic farms, to grow fodder on land set aside under the COM in cereals.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the Community deficit in vegetable protein production, the limitations of the Blair House agreement and the ban on the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, it has become necessary to create a genuine internal system of support for the production of fodder legumes and protein crops.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s proposal, which I support, seeks to open up the same opportunity for conventional livestock farms and for farms covered by any agro-environmental programme in order to achieve a broad concept of fodder legumes, bearing in mind the importance, as we proposed for Portugal, of beans, sweet lupin and yellow lupin.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the proposal lacks a real system of incentives for fodder legume and oilseed production, which might require the use of aid under the set-aside scheme or tying this partially to the production of fodder legumes, or through a change to set-aside assistance when fodder legumes are grown there.</p>

In other words, the CAP should have been reviewed in its entirety, encompassing both the feedingstuffs sector and the farming sector which produces feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the quota system should have been reviewed, especially in the Mediterranean countries, and in Greece in particular, where quotas are far below self-sufficiency and potential production levels and where the method of producing animal proteins is far healthier than the method used in the economically advanced countries of the EU, where quotas far exceed requirements, with the result that they export the dangers inherent in their feedingstuffs to all the countries with shortfalls, including Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also examine the system for pricing and subsidising fodder crops, so as to support fodder legumes, with a view to guaranteeing cheap, top quality vegetable proteins and protecting the environment, given that legumes restore the soil and are ideally suited to crop rotation programmes, especially with the soil and climate in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of which, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used various tricks, believing that the problem of BSE will be forgotten in time, in an endeavour to restore animal protein in animal feedingstuffs in six months’ time. In other words, it is endeavouring to restore meat and bonemeal which, it has now been proven, is responsible for BSE, disregarding public health in order to serve the interests of the Community feedingstuffs industry. These endeavours are confirmed by decisions on the matter so far and discussions taking place in official circles.</p>
<p class="contents">The alibi which the Committee is using for these endeavours takes the form of the proposal to cultivate certain land set aside from arable crops with fodder legumes, allegedly in order to increase the production of vegetable proteins; at the same time, however, it bans the production of seed on this land and restricts it solely to hay production, and unsubsidised hay production at that.</p>
<p class="contents">Under this proposal, little or no vegetable proteins will be produced, even in countries with extensive set aside. For Greece, however, and perhaps for other Mediterranean countries, the proposal is meaningless because they have little or no set aside.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal does absolutely nothing to resolve the problem of protein in Community fodder, and, as a result, it deliberately and consciously finds a ‘solution’ either in the Community meat and bonemeal responsible for BSE or in modified soya from the United States, which may well be equally dangerous to public health, as well as making Community livestock farmers dependent on the multinationals which market soya and soya products.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the Commission proposal does not make use of the productive potential in the Member States in order to resolve the problem of proteins, and feedingstuffs in general, once and for all and in a way which safeguards public health, because the purpose of the proposal is to mislead farmers and consumers, so that the dangerous method of producing proteins for animal feed can continue, and because I have no desire to help, even indirectly, in perpetuating this serious public health problem and deceiving arable and livestock farmers, I shall not vote in favour of the Commission proposal. I believe that my vote will act as an incentive and that the production of healthy and suitable feedingstuffs will become the subject of an objective fight on the part of the people of the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a background we have the ban of the use of meat and bone meal – a temporary ban that many of us trust will become permanent – and the now long-term EU deficit of vegetable proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is going in the right direction but it limits itself to proposing a symbolic modification, the impact of which, limited solely to organic farming, is not going to give visible results.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Auroi’s report, with the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, correct this timid proposal by extending it to farms that operate in accordance with Regulation 1257/99 on rural development, and by including, from 2002, the growing of leguminous fodder crops on land left fallow in conventional livestock farms.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way we may be able to effectively counteract the EU’s dependence on supplies of proteins that are in many cases genetically modified and, as they are used to feed livestock, are introduced into the food chain without any opportunity for control on the part of consumers.</p>

<p class="contents">This Chamber knows that I have asked for a serious debate since the start. As Members of Parliament of the Austrian People’s Party in the European Parliament, we have spoken out against this resolution because we believe and we are convinced that it does not reflect what we imagine European agricultural policy to be. It is clear that, with such resolutions, the real existential anxiety and need of European farmers cannot be addressed, given that there are 80 different types of virus and 300 million animals in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that in Austria more than 60% of land consists of mountains and disadvantaged regions. We rely on exports and we must do our utmost to ensure that these regions remain inhabited. I actually find it frivolous to make policy on a day-to-day basis at the expense of farmers. I cannot imagine how animals that have been vaccinated can be labelled. Mr President, consumer protection is a matter of great concern to all of us in this House. I do not believe that consumers would pay tribute to us for that, as it would only lead to further loss of confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public opinion is doubtful, and it is right. So the resolution we have just voted on is rightly geared towards authorisation of urgent vaccination, either in a particular region affected by foot-and-mouth disease, or in a ‘buffer’ region, or in the case of rare breeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond these urgent measures, we might wonder why foot-and-mouth, once common in the countryside of Europe, and not usually fatal to animals (let alone humans), should now be producing a national crisis. The answer is two-fold.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the disease spreads faster than before because agriculture has become massively geared towards production, and is therefore highly specialised and fragmented. One animal can spend different stages of its life in several parts of a country, or even of Europe. It is transported many times, the link with the original breeder is broken and traceability becomes unreliable. So we think it is important to re-establish more stable rearing, where everyone knows who is responsible and where animals are not treated like inert merchandise. That is part of the agricultural reform we are proposing for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the massive slaughter seems to be motivated by economic reasons which are not always transparent. One of these appears to be a determination to maintain exports at any price, because some purchaser countries regard meat from vaccinated animals as indistinguishable from meat from sick animals. Under those circumstances vaccination would be useless from the economic point of view, because in both cases the meat is worth less. I find this financial reasoning absurd. Surely exports could be accompanied by a vaccination certificate? And why must absolutely everything be subordinated to exports? That just contributes to productivity-driven farming and necessitates subsidies which cost the taxpayer dear, all to achieve, ultimately, the destabilisation of farming in less developed countries. The system is verging on insanity, and things will have to be put back on an even keel in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Foot-and-mouth, though, is an ancient disease. It does not affect humans and the majority of animals recover from it. With the development of the world market in cattle and meat, however, agri-industry has given it an international epidemic dimension it did not have before. The market imposes its own health requirements too, with tragic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of vaccine has been banned on purely economic grounds, ‘economic’ here being reduced to commercial regulations and an estimate of the financial costs which is in some respects questionable. Hundreds of thousands of healthy (or curable) animals are being slaughtered purely in the name of an accountant’s calculation of profitability. The decision-makers have only the market rules they have invented themselves to set against the despair of the farmers whose herds are being destroyed. Elementary respect for life, protection of local economies, maintenance of a thriving social fabric in the rural environment, and the living and working conditions of country people have all been ignored in the definition of health policies in response to the foot-and-mouth epidemic. All that remains is the power of the market and its laws of bronze. It is definitely high time we freed ourselves from that power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has penalised farmers and has increased people’s lack of confidence in the safety of agricultural produce. The liberalisation of agriculture and the free movement of goods have increased the risk and the spread of animal diseases with a CAP that, in the name of competitiveness and constant price reduction has promoted the concentration, intensification and centralisation of production.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current context, those who have been penalised most heavily are the producers, although we have not seen the necessary aid for compensation or sufficient contingency measures, in this case for foot-and-mouth disease. I have therefore proposed the creation of a specific budget line within the EU budget, to support farmers and measures for eradicating animal diseases, given the food, health and veterinary crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the spread of the disease, it makes sense to temporarily suspend the movement of animals between Member States and to increase controls on meat that is sold, and it is regrettable that the recent Agricultural Council did not take a decision on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to short-term measures, however, we also need a new type of agricultural policy, which protects production and supports changes in production methods. We need a policy that promotes the quality and safety of food in line with the precautionary principle. We need a form of farming that is sustainable and which promotes the specific characteristics of each region and a greater variety of aid for agricultural produce, bearing in mind the varying levels of agricultural development. We need a form of farming that contributes to economic and social cohesion and which is based firmly on family farming and on small and medium-sized holdings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Based on the notion that this will strengthen Europe’s position on the global market, silly measures are being imposed on all Member States. The course of affairs with regard to foot-and-mouth is the latest illustration of this failing. Between 1956 and 1992, we had managed to control this animal disease effectively thanks to a massive preventive vaccination campaign. Due to the one-sided consideration of export interests, we are back where we were half a century ago. Instead of introducing preventive vaccination and banning the transport of live animals over long distances, a choice is now being made in favour of pointless mass slaughter in order to destroy healthy animals. In the absence of the possibility of vaccination, this primitive approach is considered to be the only means of curbing the further spread of the disease. Even rare animals in nature reserves and zoos are now being sacrificed to the mad ban on vaccination. Farmers are bewildered and at their wits’ end. Restricted emergency vaccination and taking time out for further research are not solving the problem. In my opinion, the Member States can no longer adhere to the vaccination ban and must carry out vaccination immediately, even if this should lead to an even further setback in exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is perfectly obvious that the imperialist plans for the region have not yet been completed and that the people will be unable to live in peace until ΝΑΤΟ withdraws. As far as Palestine is concerned, they are continuing their policy of maintaining the same distance from the state terrorism being applied by Israel and the just fight of the Palestinian people for a homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic front, they have limited state aid and subsidies, taken further steps to liberalise telecommunications, postal services, the railways and energy and have prepared to complete the sell-off of the public sector to the multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint motions for resolutions not only accept the summit conclusions, they also welcome the arrest of former President of Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic, and call for him to be handed over to the ‘International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia’ in The Hague, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To say that ‘unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 1991’ is an involuntary way of recognising that it is still as high as it was ten years ago, when it was already catastrophic. In addition, the balance sheet for these ten years includes the widespread introduction, throughout Europe, of poorly paid casual work and the decline of wages as a proportion of national income.</p>

In fact, had it not been for the announcement of the joint Franco-German decision to postpone setting a deadline for the full liberalisation of the energy market until there is greater mastery of all the consequences and all the effects, the summit would certainly have been overlooked by the newspapers and TV. It was an important summit in economic and social terms, however, and entirely in line with the Lisbon Summit, with the reaffirmation of the need to take action to secure full employment and skilled jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As it turns out, those guidelines have immediately run up against the brutal announcement of redundancy plans at Danone and Marks and Spencer, with no consultation and without even having any genuine economic reasons. Veritable ‘dictatorship’ by the stock exchange and frenzied profit-seeking to the detriment of employees, when they are in fact the prime wealth creators, has demonstrated – to anyone who did not already know – what a vast gap there is between the soothing speeches of politicians and the reality experienced by employees on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">So unless we want to acknowledge the death of the European social model, we cannot stand by and do nothing, and personally, since 31 March, I have been lobbying the highest European and French authorities to propose measures to end this diabolical spiral. I am now waiting, like many in this Chamber, for precise and relevant responses. If these are not forthcoming, there will be no point in organising any summits on employment and social policy in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I support Francis Wurtz’s proposal to create an ad hoc structure within the European Parliament, a sub-committee or observatory to monitor and analyse the adjustment strategies that powerful economic groups base entirely on staff reductions. There should be a European summit on this vital issue for the equilibrium and future of Europe, in the course of 2001.

Farmers must make do with European ‘solidarity’ to cope with foot-and-mouth disease and rule out a return to the vaccination programme, cancelled a few years ago to save money. This time financial services emerge as the great victors. Between now and 2003 a single market in securities will be established to allow a few profiteers to speculate in shares and bonds. So, in the utmost opacity, financial dealings are encouraged and will revolve even more rapidly in the hands of a few industrialists, playing with the fate of millions of employees in passing.</p>

The path has therefore already been mapped out. As in the story about the half-cup of water, some will see it as half full and some as half empty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy to speed up liberalisation, particularly through privatising transport, postal services, electricity, gas and telecommunications, was, despite everything, consolidated at the Stockholm Council. Furthermore, the process of integrating the financial markets was also speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to recovering ‘full employment’, this does not necessarily mean an increase in the number of quality jobs, particularly if this increase takes place at the expense of greater job insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the so-called ‘modernisation of the European Social Model’, new attacks were made on the pensions system and changes to social security, with the method of open coordination in this area being started up and with this objective being included in the EU’s annual economic guidelines. It is worth highlighting, however, that the tiny echoes from the social part of the Lisbon strategy are due to the efforts of the workers and all progressives who want to see an economy that pays more attention to people’s problems and sustainable development.

<p class="contents">First of all, where the Balkans are concerned, I must criticise an unacceptable and flagrant example of interference and blackmail towards the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the USA, which is trying to whitewash and cover up the responsibilities of NATO and all those who waged a war against Yugoslavia, in blatant breach of the UN Charter and from within the Security Council itself. This was a war in which arms containing depleted uranium were used, the chemical and radiological effects of which on the population and on the environment have still not been fully assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes of the current situation in the Balkans are complex and deep-seated, but I must highlight the interfering role of the USA and the EU, which have significantly and, at times decisively, contributed to undermining a process whose consequences for the situation throughout the region are far from resolved. A strategy of selectively and arbitrarily criminalising certain political leaders is therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and bearing in mind the extremely serious situation in the Palestinian territories, I consider the resolution’s provisions to be quite inadequate. The resolution does not clearly and explicitly condemn the escalation of aggression by Israel, the bombings and the repression by the Israeli army against the Palestinian population or the intensification of the blockade imposed on the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must be extremely concerned about the absence of criticism of the current militarisation of the EU, which has the instrument of the common defence policy, as the European pillar of NATO, and the absence of criticism of the North-American anti-missile shield project (AMS) whose completion would contribute to relaunching the arms race and to greater insecurity throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It comes as no surprise because despite the fact that the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, at successive United Nations Conferences designed to finalise the rules for implementing the Protocol, it has presented various excuses to block negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is serious because national self-interest has won the day. It is unacceptable that, given the increasingly dramatic predictions of the effects of global warming, the country mainly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions has refused to participate in the only international instrument designed to limit these effects.</p>
<p class="contents">As serious as this decision is, however, we cannot waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States. It is crucial that we put a brake on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol – and no other type of agreement – is the most appropriate political instrument to achieve this objective. The non-participation of the United States does make the Protocol less comprehensive, but does not detract from its raison d’être. This may make application of the protocol more difficult, but it does not make it impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement by the United States and the fact that COP6 part II, a conference designed to adopt the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, forces the European Union to redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership in this political dossier. Both internally, by countering the very harmful developments in greenhouse gas emissions in most Member States and externally, by negotiating the rules for implementing the Protocol with as many countries as possible to ensure that it is ratified and implemented by 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The European also has the task of fighting to ensure that the rules of fair trade are implemented so that the United States cannot gain any illegal economic advantages from not ratifying the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment therefore, rather than insisting on a dialogue of the deaf with the United States, the European Union must implement an action plan that will enable us to implement Kyoto across the board, in other words, with as many countries as possible, and as a matter of urgency, by 2002. This action plan must enable us to achieve the following set of timetabled goals:</p>
<p class="contents">I) To negotiate, even before COP6 part II, the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol with Russia, Japan, Australia, Canada and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in order to reach an agreement that can be ratified by more than 55 countries, corresponding to more than 55% of emissions, which is the minimum level required for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force;</p>
<p class="contents">II) For the EU to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2001;</p>
