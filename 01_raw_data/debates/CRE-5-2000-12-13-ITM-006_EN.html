<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to update Parliament on preparations for the EU/US Summit in Washington next Monday. Good relations between the United States and the European Union are, of course, vital for world security and for global economic prosperity. The better the relationship, the safer the world and the better off our people.</p>
<p class="contents">Today that relationship is in generally good shape. Europe and the United States work closely together in defence of the values we share. We work together, for example, for a liberal, dependable international trading regime under the WTO. We stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of democracy and freedom across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As in any relationship between friends it is natural that there are occasional disputes, but we should not get these out of proportion. On the whole, we have managed recent disputes competently, for example, on the trade side. It is important to remember that they represent just a fraction of the total trade that crosses the Atlantic. The EU/US Consultative Forum on Biotechnology is an example of how to deal with these issues constructively. It will be reporting to this summit on a broad range of biotech issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be President Clinton's fifteenth and last EU/US Summit. It will give us an opportunity to look again at the new transatlantic agenda and to see how we might streamline procedures and focus future summits more precisely on the really big issues. We would like to focus the twice-yearly summits on strategic themes that may run across several summits. This is, I acknowledge, easier said than done, but we should try to resist the temptation – and I know that Secretary of State Albright shares this view – for these summits to get excessively entangled in the nitty-gritty of our daily political and economic relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently producing a draft communication on transatlantic relations which we expect to publish in the spring and we will look forward, for example, to the contribution made by those legislators who are part of our transatlantic relationship and Parliament will, I know, want to be involved in this initiative. We have made some progress in moving things in the direction I describe in recent summits and I hope we will be able to take this forward in Washington next week. We will, for example, be following up the discussion we launched at Cotonou on Africa and communicable diseases. There are some differences in our approach to these matters, but I hope that the summit will send a positive message about the need to pursue our efforts together notably in tackling sensitive questions such as access to affordable drugs including tiered pricing.</p>
<p class="contents">We will cover outstanding trade disputes and aim to lay the foundations for WTO compatible solutions that are mutually acceptable and not unilateral. We expect there to be discussion on a future new WTO round as well as some discussion of the implications for that round of the wide array of new bilateral trade initiatives being debated in the American hemisphere.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure there will be discussion too of other areas where the United States and the European Union do not quite see eye-to-eye, for example, on the environment where we must make every effort to support work to salvage a deal on climate change. The summit will naturally touch on key areas where the European Union and the United States have worked and are working closely together in the service of peace, first, on the Balkans where we have had an increasingly close and successful relationship and where, partly thanks to our efforts, there have been so many important changes for the better over the last year. We shall, no doubt, review recent developments in the Middle East. The President and his administration have devoted enormous efforts to the pursuit of lasting peace in the Middle East. Today the dark shadow of violence hangs over the region, but the patient persistent efforts of the peacemakers must continue. The European Union has a role to play in the process and we are doing that. Plainly the consolidation of peace will be closely related to the development of our Mediterranean partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will, I am sure, touch on the recent decisions at Nice on the European rapid reaction force. These are important decisions. They represent an attempt by Europe to make good some of the failures revealed in the Balkans in the 1990s and most recently during the Kosovo conflict. One of the main lessons was that the Europeans needed to shoulder more of the burden in promoting European security. We need to do so, not to decouple the United States from the defence of Europe, not because we believe there is any weakening of the US strategic commitment to Europe, but to answer those in Washington who sometimes call it into question: the voices that claim, with some justification, that Europe cannot continue to depend on the United States to bail it out of European conflicts unless it is prepared to do more to help itself.</p>
<p class="contents">This then will be the last summit under this administration, the last such summit with President Clinton. Transatlantic relations will, I hope, grow ever stronger in the years to come, but Europe will miss President Clinton. He has been a good friend to this continent. He has laid the foundations for a serious and mature dialogue between us in the post-Cold-War world and he has worked tirelessly for a cause we all share, that of a Europe whole and free and increasingly prosperous. From Kosovo to Belfast, millions of European citizens have cause to be thankful for the contribution he has made and I know that the House will join with me in paying tribute to that contribution today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has rightly said that the transatlantic relationship is one which has expanded greatly in the last ten years – mostly, it is true, on the American side thanks to President Clinton; but I think that history will relate that there has also been a European contribution to this new relationship, which has been a fundamental key to the way in which it has worked, through the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and through the new Transatlantic Agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be very helpful, as the Commission prepares this new document on transatlantic relations, if we in Parliament could be given a document which analyses the progress which has been made so far in this relationship in looking at, for example, the success of the EU educational centres, success in terms of policy cooperation on such matters as AIDS, immigration, aid development issues and even on foreign policy questions such as work on transatlantic houses in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally it would be very helpful to know, because we are financing these in the budget of the European Union, how the dialogues have been developing. The TABD, the Business Dialogue was very successful in its last meeting in Cincinatti, but we note that since then the Environment Dialogue has closed down in the last couple of weeks. Therefore, I think an analysis of what has happened would be very helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, what next? I believe that where we in this House are, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, building up relationships, through the Legislators' Dialogue between the European Parliament and Congress, we would hope, in the longer term, to see that turn into a form of transatlantic assembly. Equally, we would like to see how the different dialogues of the business dialogue can be put into a broader partnership framework. I would ask the Commissioner, in the run-up to the release of this document in April, under a new US Administration, apparently, it was decided today, under a new US President, hopefully George W. Bush, to see how to deepen this partnership in the future, based on the new Treaty of Nice which extends the activities of the European Union so as to enable it to be a real partner with the United States in the decade ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner Patten, I believe you have given us a good introduction and briefing on the issues and topics that we shall be discussing, and I believe the honourable Member, Mr Elles, was right to emphasise the need to establish precisely what we wish our transatlantic relationship to achieve in the year 2001 and beyond. The most important thing for us will be to consolidate, to examine very carefully the actual progress that has been made in the various programmes we have launched under the umbrella of the Transatlantic Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the topics referred to by Mr Elles. But there is another area which is very important and which has come in for a great deal of criticism, namely the mutual-recognition agreements, which have given rise to very many problems on both sides of the Atlantic, especially the American side. I should be grateful if you would deal in detail with these agreements in the communication which is scheduled for the spring of next year and if, besides the analysis requested by the other side of the House, you would also make proposals as to how we can achieve new aims in future in all domains – in the various dialogues, in our cooperation in the fields of foreign policy and security policy and even in practical everyday areas such as the mutual-recognition agreements. That will be very, very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area relates to the aforementioned EU educational centres, which I believe have been highly successful. Consolidation is important, but so, too, is the right perspective. I believe you touched on an important point there. Under the Clinton Administration, we have made great strides in the realm of political cooperation. However, we have also seen trade policy, and trade disputes in particular, playing an ever greater role as a determinant of general political relations and gaining absolutely unmerited prominence, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that, at future summit meetings, you actually manage to focus attention on the major political issues and that matters such as the trade disputes which highlight differences between us are assigned to their proper place, that their importance is not exaggerated and that they are not allowed to become focal points of political discord between Europe and the United States. So it will be important to change tack here and write a real Transatlantic Agenda for the year 2001. I know that our Ambassador in Washington, Gunter Burghardt, has already spoken about this, and I should be delighted if his interesting proposals were actually incorporated into your communication.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish you every success in this task. I also wish our Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, every success in his efforts to bring about the settlement of our trade disputes with the United States, and it would please me to see you present the communication at the earliest possible date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there seem to be many issues which this summit should address on its agenda, and one that I would like to see there is follow-up to the disappointing breakdown of the climate change talks in The Hague and how to get the US to take its responsibilities more seriously. But the area that I want to focus on is world trade, the whole idea of a new trade round one year after Seattle. This would seem an opportune time to take stock. I think it is clear that before any new round is considered we need to address the perception of many developing countries that nothing has changed since Seattle in spite of the many promises that were made at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the Commission is now talking about reviving elements of its position for a new round, making it more flexible, and I look forward to knowing what that really means in practice. I also know and welcome the Everything but Arms Initiative and would urge the Commission to use the occasion of the summit to press the US again to join in with this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need to go further in building confidence with poorer countries. Research from the development agency OXFAM has shown that when they have discussed what has changed since Seattle with the developing country delegations, the perceptions are that nothing has changed at all. Bangladesh, for example, says and I quote: "Sufficient and sustained efforts have not been made by the developed countries to build our confidence in the WTO.” Lesotho has said: "What has the WTO market liberalisation brought to Lesotho?" There are very many quotes that I hear from developing country delegations, all of which are saying that nothing much has happened. I will conclude with the Dominican Republic, which says: "The WTO was supposed to have been an impartial referee of common rules where countries could learn to play the game. It has not turned out that way. The rules are biased against the weak and nothing has changed since Seattle." The forthcoming summit is the crucial opportunity to address those issues, to change the rules, and to make world trade work for the poor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore ask you and the European Union representatives attending Monday’s Summit to tackle political issues and, more specifically, the issue of the death penalty at the same level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to remain silent about this State crime, especially when it is committed by the most powerful nation on earth which too often attempts to impose its own order and values on the rest of the planet. That particular value, at any event, is one that we do not want. It is impossible to accept that the only solution to crime and violence is further crime and violence. It is therefore necessary to take action to prevent the irreversible fate that awaits those women and men who, like Mumia Abu-Jamal or Leonard Pelletier, have sometimes been on death row for years.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the world, voices are being raised to demand a form of justice which is a genuine reflection of the values of human respect and of the basic rights and freedoms of the individual. On every continent, a petition demanding the abolition of the death penalty is being signed by hundreds of thousands of people. As Nicole Fontaine rightly reminded us this morning, preserving this most precious commodity called life means, in the end, obtaining a universal moratorium on the death penalty as a first step towards its abolition. I believe that advantage should be taken of the dialogue that exists between the European Union and the United States in order to finally achieve this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we must not lose sight of the fact that Europe has been built in opposition to empires or, rather, between empires. The Soviet Union was a threatening empire and the United States of America was a protective empire, but one <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> which we had every intention of affirming our identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even if the retreat of the Communist threat is a cause for rejoicing, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left us with a single superpower in the form of the United States of America. Now, it is a law of nature that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and there are symptoms of such corruption, for instance: a form of economic diplomacy which might be summed up in the words, ‘what is ours is ours and what is yours is negotiable’, the claim of establishing a new world order, a <span class="italic">pax Americana</span> whose influence is far from that of always promoting peace, and the unacceptable development of unqualified interference in the internal affairs of other States.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion must be drawn that the traditional friendship and real sympathy we have for the American people is to no avail here. The United States of America is our competitor. It has no problem defending its own interests. We ought, in turn, to defend ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Three recommendations, therefore. We must question the usefulness of arrangements such as NATO which no longer fulfil their original objective of ensuring common security and which are compromising our freedom. We must defend our political autonomy and stop taking sides with the United States, whether it be in the UNO, with regard to Iraq or the Arab world in general, in Asia or in the Balkans, where our actions, Mr Patten, have had disastrous consequences, whatever you may say. Finally, we should have no problem defending our own economic interests, not only within the WTO but, above all, in areas which, from culture to agriculture, are coterminous with European civilisation and must not therefore be subject simply to the laws of the market or of international barter.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what all Europeans should be saying if they are concerned to see the type of independent Europe which we have portrayed to our compatriots and for which, in reality, we are still waiting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, in response to Mr Elles, we should be delighted to provide, as a backdrop to the discussion on the communication we shall produce in the new year on the strengthening of the dialogue between Europe and the United States, an analysis of the progress that we have made so far since 1990. We should be delighted to incorporate in that analysis a review of the way that the various dialogues have been developing. That is a useful idea and we will certainly follow it up.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will also pursue the very important point Mrs Mann made on mutual recognition agreements and we should take account of her wise observation that one must not get trade disputes out of proportion. I think I am right in saying that EU/US trade amounts to about EUR 1billion a day and the total worth of the sanctions applied by the United States against European goods represents about six hours' worth of trade. So, as the honourable Member said, we should not get these things out of proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested by what Mrs Lucas said about world trade and the importance of trying to ensure that increasingly free trade works in the interests of the poor as well as the better off. I know that my colleague Commissioner Lamy will want to pursue his thoughts and the Commission's latest thoughts on how to revive the WTO round with the United States and also with this Parliament. I know he has a good and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees with an interest in these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Mrs Boudjenah, who spoke about the death penalty, was probably present in the Chamber a few weeks ago when we had an extremely interesting debate on the death penalty, which touched on the situation in the United States, among other countries. I believe I am right in recalling that there have been 81 executions in the United States this year. We have made, and will continue to make, individual and collective representations about the death penalty in the United States. I should like to assure the honourable Member of that. We take a very clear position on the death penalty around the world, and that relates to our friends in the United States as well as to others elsewhere who may not be quite so well-disposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gollnisch and I perhaps look at the world through different spectacles. I am not greatly persuaded of the arguments about the devilish hegemonist in Washington. I do not agree with everything the United States does, but we in Europe have good cause to recall the contribution which the United States made during the second half of the last century to our freedom and prosperity. But the honourable Member is entirely right that there are issues like the environment, trade, landmines, extraterritoriality and legislation where we take a rather different position from the United States. We should take that position vigorously, without thinking that to do so will somehow undermine our relationship with our greatest friends and allies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
