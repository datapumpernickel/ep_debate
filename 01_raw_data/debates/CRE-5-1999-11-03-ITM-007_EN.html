<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – As you said, the proposal for which I am responsible is that relating to the enforcement of seafarers’ hours of work on board ships using Community ports.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just one element of an overall package of proposals that were brought forward by the Commission last November to try to plug the loopholes of the sectors that were excluded from the original working-time directive back in 1993. I hope we are nearing the final chapters in this long saga and that soon we will have all sectors covered by arrangements on working time to protect worker health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as a quick reminder, the batch that was brought forward last year by the Commission included first of all an overall amendment of the 1993 directive, that is the subject of Mrs Smet’s report; a directive on road transport, sadly that one is totally blocked in the Transport Council at the moment I understand it; the third, a directive implementing the agreement between the social partners on seafarers, was adopted in the form of a directive in June this year so that element is taken care of, and then finally the proposal that I am speaking on today, a directive on the enforcement of working hours on board ships using Community ports. The three proposals effectively need to be seen together in relation to the one proposal I am speaking on.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the agreement reached between the two sides of industry in the maritime sector, there is the specific proposal relating to seafarers having recourse to Community ports, but also there is ILO Convention 180 and in fact the agreement between the two sides of industry in the maritime sector was very closely based on ILO Convention 180. These three proposals: the agreement, the directive on seafarers’ hours and the ILO Convention are designed to come into effect together in mid-2002.</p>
<p class="contents">At the first reading on this particular proposal Parliament made no amendments but the rapporter, Hugh McMahon at that time, made the point that it was absolutely essential that these three instruments should come into effect at the same time to avoid any competitive disadvantage. I am therefore very pleased indeed that seems to have been agreed and we seem to be making progress in that direction. The fact that the ILO Convention now has a time limit set down effectively in the form of the other two directives means that we will, I am sure, have sufficient Member States with sufficiently large fleets ratifying the Convention to make sure that it too comes into effect in mid-2002. The only significant difference in the common position compared with the first reading position is that the implementation date has been put back by one year. That really is to allow Member States to overcome one or two technical difficulties they might have in ratifying ILO Convention 180 and thereby allowing the whole package to be brought into effect at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I could also say that I have just met with the two sides of industry from the maritime sector and congratulated them heartily on the agreement they reached. It took five years of negotiation to reach the agreement in the maritime sector. These things do not happen easily, they do not happen overnight but they did work extremely hard and we are now seeing the fruits of the social dialogue in that particular sector. I think it is very sad indeed that we have not seen similar progress in the road sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties we are now facing in the Transport Council over the legislative proposal the Commission brought forward stem directly from the fact that there was a failure to make progress on a framework agreement on working time in the road sector. It reveals a real sharp contrast to the progress that was made in the maritime sector. That really poses a danger; it poses a danger to the revision to the general directive that Mrs Smet is also dealing with and the danger is this: the rail sector is included in the general directive. The two sides of industry there agreed to be included in the general directive so long as parallel progress was made in the road sector because they quite naturally fear a competitive disadvantage if they put in place wide-ranging arrangements to cover working time but the road sector does not. I hope the Transport Council will hear that message and that we will see some progress to make sure that road transport is covered, otherwise we see a real danger to the rail sector element of the revision to the general directive.</p>
<p class="contents">For now, however, I can thoroughly commend the common position in relation to the enforcement of seafarers’ hours at work on board ships using Community ports. This will make sure that the workers on board vessels from third countries having recourse to our ports are covered by the same broad arrangements as the agreement between the two sides of industry. It is a perfectly sensible and good proposal and I commend it to the House.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the PPE Group agrees with the rapporteur’s recommendation on the second reading and would like to thank the rapporteur for a sound and comprehensive report. I think it is very important that if an ILO treaty is concluded which does not provide binding and enforceable legislation – this also includes inspections, sanctions and remedial measures – so we fail to succeed in this, then we have not done our work properly. We would therefore back the rapporteur’s draft directive concerning seafarers on board ships calling at Community ports.</p>
<p class="contents">The other report concerns the organisation of working hours. If you, Mr President, were to have a heart attack any time now, which of course I do not wish upon you, then I hope you will be treated and cared for by a junior doctor who has benefited from sound training and a good night’s sleep, because in a number of EU Member States this is by no means certain. It could well be that this doctor has been on duty for 70 hours over the past five days or has carried out medical and even surgical operations for the past 14 hours without a break. It could also be that this doctor does not have enough experience in order to carry out this type of work but will do so anyway out of necessity without the supervision of a competent senior. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, when you – in good health, I hope – make your way home by car immediately after this session, then you will still not be safe. You will be sharing the roads with other vehicles and especially transport operators, including truck drivers. They should only drive for 10 hours a day but they also carry out other duties apart from driving, such as cleaning or maintenance. These working hours are not regulated in a number of EU Member States. So on the way home, you may well have to face a transport operator who has only been driving for 10 hours that day but has spent 5 hours loading and unloading on top of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it is important in terms of both public health and road safety that junior doctors and truck drivers respectively are given reasonable breaks and working hours. Moreover, working hours form part of health and safety at work and of competition rules, both of which fall within the scope of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the entire transport sector, activities at sea and junior doctors are excluded from the scope of the working time directive of 1993. In order to nullify this inadequate exemption rule, the Commission drafted a White Paper in 1997 and made an announcement in 1998 which included a draft directive reviewing the working time directive. The European Parliament pronounced its opinion as early as the first reading and the Council has since established a common position. Meanwhile, the institutional context has changed and we are now involved in a co-decision procedure with the European Council. </p>
<p class="contents">In the capacity of rapporteur, I have sought a balance, not only between the Commission’s draft directive, the first reading of the European Parliament and the Council’s common position, but especially between the safety and health of both workers and the other parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">So the issue is restricting working hours to benefit the safety and health of employees at work, especially in the various transport sectors, for activities at sea and in the case of junior doctors. The Council is right in distinguishing between mobile and non-mobile workers. The Social Affairs Committee has adopted this distinction but not the definition issued by the Council. According to the Council, mobile workers also include own-account transport operators and transport operators who work outside the transport sector, such as those involved in the transportation of concrete in the timber and construction sectors, for example. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of our Parliament has rejected this definition, partly because these workers would then be partially excluded from the scope of the existing working time directive. They presently come under its scope and no problems have materialised so far. I therefore wonder why the Council is so keen to introduce a change, hence an amendment. </p>
<p class="contents">Not included in the description of mobile workers are rail transport workers. There has been a European collective agreement in place since 1998 which advocates the wholesale inclusion of rail transport in the existing working time directive, barring a few exemptions. This has been the case but this collective agreement also states that a solution needs to be found, not only for rail but also for road transport and other methods of transport for which there is, as yet, no solution. I would remind the Commission that it has also promised to issue separate proposals for the air-transport sector and internal shipping. Nothing has been tabled so far. As far as road transport is concerned, as already stated by Mr Hughes, no agreement appears to have been reached within the Council, which I regret. </p>
<p class="contents">At any rate, all mobile workers in the transport sectors are guided by four basic principles which are embodied in the common position on the draft directive and which, in fact, also apply to seafarers and junior doctors; namely four weeks’ annual paid leave, restricted annual working hours, appropriate breaks and medical examination in the case of night work. This applies without any restrictions to all workers in the transport sector. In addition, provisions need to be drafted for each sector with regard to daily breaks, weekly breaks, other breaks and night shifts. This has been regulated in the railway sector and this is being regulated here for seafarers and junior doctors. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 concerns exemption in the case of work activities where the employees live at considerable distances from their workplace or there is a significant distance between the employee’s various workplaces. Needless to say, this deviation applies also, but not exclusively, to the off-shore sector. Hence the need for a legal technical amendment. Similarly, Amendment No 4 is a legal technical amendment on urban transport. Amendment No 5 regulates the weekly working hours of junior doctors. The Council and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are aiming for 48 hours over a four-month reference period. This is the goal we would like to achieve. The Council, however, has accepted a transitional period of 13 years, I repeat 13 years! </p>
<p class="contents">According to the European Parliament, this is far too long and it proposes a four-year transitional period. This is more than adequate. A transitional period of 13 years cannot be justified from the point of view of health and safety. There have been enough accidents in hospitals involving junior doctors to render the Council’s proposal unjustified. So we are in favour of a limited transitional period. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 relates to the reference period for calculating weekly working hours in the off-shore sector. The Council authorises the Member States to extend the reference period of four months to twelve months. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is in agreement, provided that the two sides of industry involved enter into consultation and negotiation with each other, although this consultation does not have to lead to any agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 provides for seafarers on board sea-fishing vessels to work an average of 48 hours per week over a 12-month reference period. This is comparable to that provided by a collective agreement for seafarers. The time which the Council gives the Member States and hence itself to transpose the directive amending the existing working time directive is, according to the common Council position, four years. This is a huge exaggeration, Commissioner. It is even the case that only three years were allowed for the transposition of the original directive, which was a great deal more detailed in those days. A transitional period of four years is suggested here. We would like to restrict this to two years. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, working hours are often a matter of give and take, with some flexibility around the edges. But sometimes it is also a matter of life and death. To conclude, for the millions of transport operators, seafarers, junior doctors, for the patients, the passengers and other road users, it is absolutely essential that a sound agreement is reached swiftly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Luckily, there is a stream of people from our group who will illustrate this issue. I am also very pleased that so many people from my group have expressed an interest in this social issue. I think that, in practice, this often means more to people than long debates on macroeconomic dialogues, etc. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by thanking both rapporteurs, Stephen Hughes and Miet Smet, but I would also say a big thankyou to Raf Chanterie, who got the ball rolling in the previous Parliament, for his contribution. As far as I can see, although there are few amendments to the documents from Stephen Hughes, this Parliament has invested a great deal of time and effort in the relevant sectors. The sectors, however, are very complex indeed and especially with regard to road transport, it is extremely regrettable that no agreement has been reached. It is now really up to the Council to reach some sort of resolution, because the minute strikes break out, the whole of Europe will go mad. We now have time to solve this matter and this is the time to do it. The Council is putting itself in a very vulnerable position if yet again something were to happen in the field of road transport. This, of course, applies even more so to the Commission because it has failed to submit any proposals with regard to the other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in general, we have reached acceptable compromises. The off-shore sector has proved to be a highly complex area but we eventually reached a sound compromise that is better than the one the Council proposed but not as far-reaching as some attempted to make it. Also, I think we have found an extremely good compromise where junior doctors are concerned. Here again, I would say that I hope the Council adopts this.</p>
<p class="contents">Actually, I have a proposal. Let those individuals in the countries which do not wish to see this issue resolved over a twelve-year period seek treatment by doctors who have worked in excess of 48 hours. If they need to perform brain surgery or something similar, let’s volunteer one of the Members of the Council. Maybe this would help them realise that it is rather dangerous to have junior doctors work such long hours once the first Council Member has passed away following an operation that went wrong. My concern is that this is not happening at the moment but that poorer people are being exposed to this experiment and I do not think that this is the intention. </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I firmly believe that sound proposals are being tabled and that further negotiations with the Council are certainly called for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – I would like to talk just briefly about some of the amendments tabled in the report by Mrs Smet.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all Amendment No 5 relating to the working time of junior doctors in training. I agree absolutely with the amendment that has been tabled here reinstating the first reading position. I know certain Member States feel that a far longer transition period will be necessary. It might well be that the maintenance of this amendment will take us into conciliation. That will give us an opportunity to look at the circumstances facing certain Member States but for now I think it is absolutely right that we stick to this amendment. Mr Pronk is absolutely right. We should ask ourselves would we want to be receiving an injection from a doctor at the end of an 18-hour working day, which is not unusual.</p>
<p class="contents">In the offshore sector, Amendment No 6 – we have looked long and hard to try to come up with a formulation that will make sure that we get a collective agreement leading to the maximum flexibility available under the directive, that is annualisation of working time. The formulation of the common position would have simply allowed the employers to walk away from attempts to reach negotiation on annualisation of working time and Member States could then have allowed annualisation. We have built in an addition here that will ask for a review after five years involving the two sides of industry at European level to see how the regime is functioning in this sector with particular reference to the health and safety of the workers involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 relates to sea fishing. The effect of this amendment will be to try to limit to one year the reference period available for the annualisation of the calculation of working time, in other words making sure that annualisation of working time is possible but no more. If we go to two, three or more years as the reference period for the calculation of working time it becomes absolutely meaningless and we feel that the maximum flexibility of one year annualisation should be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 8 we look at the issue of the transposition period to be allowed to the Member States. The common position proposes four years which I think is without precedent in the social area. We have looked in this amendment to return to the first reading position of two years. Perhaps again this is something that will be subject to conciliation but we will have to see if and when that is triggered following our vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point relates to urban transport, Amendment No 9. We have also built in here a review in order to try to remove an anomaly. The way things stand we would have a different regime applying to a person driving a tram to a person driving an urban bus. That needs to be reviewed. We think a five-year time period should be sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly want to speak about doctors in training. As others have said, it has been a concern in a number of Member States for many years and of particular concern for EU residents who travel, let alone those who reside in places like the United Kingdom or Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States have clearly not acted quickly enough on this. Looking at some of the rates of pay for overtime one might understand their lack of incentive. However, we believe that now is the time to up the pace for change.</p>
<p class="contents">The working time for more than one quarter of a million doctors in training in the European Union is an issue of health and safety for the doctors themselves, who should have the same rights to safeguard their health and personal lives as those they treat. It is a similar issue for those who need treatment. We want to be sure that those treating us are able to act effectively and efficiently, which we cannot be when we have research showing that 24 hours of sustained wakefulness reduces performance to levels associated with excessive alcohol intake without – I would argue – some of the pleasures.</p>
<p class="contents">Training doctors is a lengthy and expensive business, we are told. It is a reason for giving a lengthy implementation time, some governments argue. However, there is reason to believe that the harsh working hours contribute to a significant drop-out rate, with a particular impact on women junior doctors. We therefore urge colleagues to support the four years proposed in this report because we believe we need to accelerate change through negotiation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, I do not agree with the date of implementation of that measure being postponed until the end of 2002. It should have taken immediate effect. </p>
<p class="contents">May I take the opportunity, however, to denounce the unacceptable situation on ships at present. My country is a country with an advanced merchant navy and so we know what we are talking about. We have increased workloads and exploitation of seafarers by ship owners, and, at the same time, the situation with regard to health and safety of life at sea is worsening. We have many fatal naval accidents making ship owners wealthier and seafarers fewer.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, those responsible for this situation are the politicians who allow unrestrained action to ship owners who, in many ways, are forcing their crews to work very hard in exceptionally dangerous conditions, very often pushing them to the limits of human endurance. Those same politicians are making reductions in the number of workers per ship. Therefore, if the real cause of the problems facing seafarers is not identified or recognised, then it would be pointless to introduce measures and create control mechanisms, such as the one concerning the rest period for seafarers which will not only be ineffective but will also be hypocritical as it will only increase workloads and lead to even greater exploitation. It is essential that demands for a five-day, 35-hour, working week with no more that 7 – 8 hours work per day, are met, and with pay rises. We must also put an end to regulations obliging seafarers to work a 12-hour day as standard. It is imperative that the operational crew members on board ships be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Mr President, we support the just demands of the seafarers and we shall stand by them. And regardless of how positive those directives may be or whatever improvements may come of it, we cannot vote for them since they will eventually perpetuate the current unacceptable state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Crowley (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, I, like my colleagues, would like to congratulate both our rapporteurs on the presentation of their work. Also, as this is the first opportunity I have had, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the House for this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole area of working time and the directive have created a lot of difficulties for individual Members and also in Member States. I feel that whilst each of us in this House would welcome the opportunity to ensure a safer working environment, not only for employees, but also for consumers and other users of transport and so on, we have to ensure that we do not over-regulate in any individual area. Therefore, my group will be seeking separate votes on certain paragraphs, in particular within the Smet report.</p>
<p class="contents">When framing legislation we have an obligation to ensure that legislation is effective, that it can be easily enforced and that it does not impose an onerous burden on employees or enterprises. I feel there are some areas within the present proposals which will create difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to mobile workers, the exclusion of own-account operators from the definition will subject this group to the full rigours of the original working time directive. This will mean, for instance, that in the road transport area there will be three categories of operators: own-account, third party hauliers and self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the deletion of mobile workers from Article 17 dilutes the opportunity for mobile workers to extend the reference period from 4 to 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the proposed sector-specific directive for working time in road transport, when finalised, will supersede this common position and will provide a more detailed regulatory framework for this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of these issues we should be cognisant of the difficulties which will be created. Therefore I am recommending a negative vote in relation to these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further point to bear in mind. The intention of the introduction of this legislation, as I said earlier, was protection of health and safety. However, I have in my possession a study carried out by University College, Dublin, which highlights the negative impact of this proposed extension of the directive, not only on the grounds of safety and competitiveness, but also on the grounds of damage to the environment. The Commission already has a copy of this study. I would welcome a response from it with regard to the points highlighted in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer very briefly to some of the points highlighted. Firstly, the overall cost of the directive would be far greater than that proposed under the impact assessment. Secondly, the average cost increase for firms in this study would be in excess by about a hundred times that of the study carried out by the EC which stated that it would be 0.2%.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of this directive will not be uniform across all sectors of the economy and therefore it will negatively impact on certain sectors, in particular those areas that are more heavily dependent on transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is likely that rather than aligning competition, the application of a single standard across all road transport and other transport areas in some Member States will actually distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals will also lead to a conflict with other goals with regard to the regulation of traffic to reduce congestion and other impacts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we already have in place in the transport sector tachograph requirements which are rigorously enforced in all Member States and which may be one way of dealing with some of the concerns about the health and safety aspect. We should look at modifying and solidifying those tachograph requirements. In Ireland we have a road safety plan which has been in operation since 1998. This is a five-year plan which aims to reduce road deaths, the amount of traffic on the roads and to ensure that the quality of vehicles on the road meet the highest possible standards to protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point I want to cover is with regard to junior doctors and training. This is an area that has been fraught with danger for the Member States. I believe everybody in this House would welcome the opportunity to give a very positive and assertive vote in favour of the proposals put forward by Mrs Smith in her report with regard to reducing the transitional period to four years. There is no reason why we need a 13-year introduction. Even the common position proposal of 7 years is too long.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of us is fully aware that junior doctors in training carry out tasks which are virtually the same as those carried out by their so-called “masters”, the consultants. Indeed, in 1994 the report commissioned by the European Commission which looked at this whole area of junior doctors in training highlighted seven points which need immediate action: the excessive hours of work in some countries; the question of on-call duties; unrealistic rostering periods; protracted periods of continuous duty; the distribution of duties between junior doctors and senior doctors; informal pressures on doctors in training; the vulnerability of breaks and time off in the face of the pressure of service needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had several meetings with junior doctors in Ireland over the last number of months with regard to this issue. One of the areas that is of highest concern to them is that because of the existence in Ireland – and in Britain as well, for example – of the archaic feudal-type system whereby junior doctors in training are apprenticed – I use that word broadly – to senior consultants, they are afraid to raise too many issues of concern, because it might affect their future careers. What we have to guarantee is that the proper level of health care and health protection can be given to patients in the health service and also, that junior doctors are given the highest possible level of training with proper standards for their working conditions and working time – this will mean a reduction in the amount of hours that are worked – and also, the other so-called duties which they are obliged to carry out merely to deliver the service. We have a model in Australia and New Zealand which could usefully be copied in the European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the concerns of fishermen, special consideration has to be given to this special sector. There is no other sector to which it can be compared. The proposals put forward are unrealistic and impractical. We must ensure that fishermen’s rights to earn their living are not hindered by ridiculous regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extremely important sector. I come from a country, Italy, where this sector has always been of considerable importance because of the employment it has created, and it is a sector which no longer manages to give workers what it used to. Workers in this sector have experienced a veritable regression; they have gone back in time. Today, they earn less and work more, victims of a liberal capitalism which makes them real victims in this sector. Even moving the implementation of the agreements to 2002 has baffled us. We believe that Parliament must do more, do it soon and do it well in order to rectify the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to concentrate on two specific categories: junior doctors and fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning junior doctors, I was delighted that the European Parliament, in committee, has agreed on Amendment No 5 with regard to a transitional period of four years instead of the Council position of nine years, which I believe is too long. Doctors have our lives in their hands. It is important that they are included in the working time directive. I was worried about the weekly working hours and how they should not exceed the 54 hours over a four-month reference period. That is why I would like you, for the same reasons, to support Amendment No 10 tabled in my name.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention here that on the order paper it looks as if I had taken out some of the recital 11. In fact my amendment is purely and simply an addition, an add-on to recital 11. I am not taking out anything in that. I ask for your support.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important also with derogations on minimum daily rest periods that we still have adequate rest for doctors. I know doctors in the UK who work 56-hour shifts consecutively; 9 am on Saturday to 5 p.m. on Monday is not uncommon. We are not asking for an 11-hour rest period. We are asking for, say, six hours within a 24-hour period. That is not asking too much. If doctors do not get that their judgment will suffer. We do not allow people to drink and drive because their coordination is gone. I do not believe we should allow junior doctors to be able to practice medicine. I urge you to support Amendment No 10. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not really see how this measure can be monitored satisfactorily because the Community ports and the countries within the European Community have no real jurisdiction over those ships that are flagged or owned in overseas countries. If we take it forward: Say, for instance, they had agreed that some monitoring was possible – surely they would not have certain working hours outside European Community waters and ports and then change once they were inside our geographical area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been talking about this with American lawyers over recent weeks – personal friends, I have no interest to declare here. They just feel that it is wrong that ports should dictate to owners of ships. We want the maximum trade here in the European Union. We want to make sure that cruise ships come here, spend money here and give employment to our various countries. I do not see how it is possible to monitor a practice that would seem to be more a matter of international law. Ship owners and the nations that have these ships flagged in those countries should be monitored elsewhere rather than by European countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I want to make a few points before I deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the original directive excluded six million workers from its remit. It seems to me that was excessive and unfair. I cannot see how you can make a distinction between trainee doctors who are fatigued, truck drivers who are fatigued or fishermen who are fatigued. They all are a risk either to themselves, to those who work with them, their patients or other road users. I do not see how Mr Crowley can make the distinction he has made. I hope he is not reflecting the Irish Government’s position in relation to these proposals. It is scandalous and unacceptable that trainee doctors in Irish hospitals are expected to work sometimes in excess of 80 hours a week. It is scandalous and disgraceful that we have truck drivers who are falling asleep at the wheel, putting the lives of those who are working with them and other road users at risk. We know that there is a fairly high rate of road accidents as a result of truck drivers who are driving hours too long.</p>
<p class="contents">For Mr Crowley to claim that the tachograph legislation is rigorously applied in Ireland or anywhere else is simply not true. I do not know why that is the case. I do not know why it is not rigorously applied but it is not. We need to take steps to protect the public at large and patients. It is not good enough for any Member State in the Council to say that it would be costly to implement these proposals. Of course it will be costly but what price do you put on the life of a child who may be knocked down on the road, or a patient in hospital who may receive wrong treatment as a result of the fatigue of a doctor? It is just not acceptable. It is necessary that tomorrow we adopt the position as proposed by the rapporteurs and as proposed by the ESOC Committee and put it to the Council that it must finally come to grips with this issue and ensure that nobody has to work the inhuman hours that we are expecting our trainee doctors to work.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to truck drivers, it seems to me that the only way to regulate this is to put it into law. Own-account truck drivers will work all the hours that they get because they are not sure when they will get another job. So it is necessary to apply the law so that they will be forced to take rest and forced not to be on the road when they are simply too tired to drive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For certain professional groups, establishing working hours is not only a question of doing the obvious and protecting the individuals concerned but also, and to a large degree, a question of our own general safety. The roads are not going to become safer and better if those who drive heavy goods vehicles are not alert and wide awake but tired and irritated. This is a matter which concerns all of us. </p>
<p class="contents">Young junior doctors’ working hours must also be reviewed directly from a public health point of view. Firstly, to demand from these young junior doctors an average of up to 60 hours’ work per week during a four-month period is ruthless exploitation of young people, because they have to do these shifts in order to pass their exams. Secondly, it is the rest of us who are going to meet these young junior doctors out in health centres and casualty departments. In those circumstances, one can only hope that they are fully rested and wide awake and can at any rate judge whether a particular case is one they can deal with themselves or one for which they need recourse to a colleague on duty.

Also, the present additional directive tabled by Mrs Smet, which includes additional sectors and activities, is of great importance and we give it our full backing. In addition to a few previous minor remarks made by my group, I would like to make a few observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In some EU countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Finland, employers in road transport have, within the framework of a strategy of contracting-out and more flexibility, rendered their wheels i.e. trucks and transport operators independent as it were. They hire these <span class="italic">zelfstandigen zonder personeel</span> (staffless own-account workers), as they are referred to in the Netherlands, to carry out the same activities. These own-account transport operators are no longer in someone’s employment but their role is virtually the same and the risks are to be borne by them. Both trade unions and employers’ organisations would like to see arrangements made for them. So they fall outside the scope of this new directive. Their health and safety is not protected because they are self-employed. They hardly seem to be involved in the consultation between the European social partners in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, this phenomenon can also be identified in other sectors, such as the building sector and a few others besides. The social issues which we are facing here seem to reflect to a certain degree some of the guidelines from the employment policy. We should think very carefully about what this means. As far as I know, a number of guidelines are being drafted behind the scenes but there are also barriers to these activities and their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission to raise this issue as soon as possible and make the necessary additional proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that we have common legislation on working hours within the EU, it is in fact incomprehensible and unacceptable that key groups such as young doctors, train drivers and air crew, seafarers and other such groups should be exempt. On the contrary, it might be thought that these particular groups might have a special need for legislation of this kind. I believe that this situation is due to a number of factors, and partly to particularly bad traditions. In the case of the mobile professions, for example, there are poor conditions for safety work of a practical and technical nature. At the same time, employers have had a great need for continuity of service or production, and this has become the decisive factor. </p>
<p class="contents">It should also be remembered that, as we have mentioned here, there are also traditions of this kind where young doctors are concerned. One example – which a number of people here have mentioned – is that of young doctors’ dependence upon senior physicians and professors. Someone talked of feudal traditions, in which case what is meant is old traditions which force young doctors to work in a way and to a degree that is harmful. Their professional future depends upon their doing this. </p>
<p class="contents">Traditions such as these must be broken. Most people seem to be in agreement with this. Where agreement breaks down is in the wish to postpone the necessary changes, perhaps for financial or practical reasons. This is something which this Parliament must oppose. We must attach much more importance to the protection of workers than is implied by this type of short-term, expedient reasoning. I think we should also remember the need to emphasise that unusual, different and, in various ways, mobile labour markets should also be brought under the umbrella of this directive. In fact, we are getting more and more professional groups who are working under mobile conditions, together with more and more individuals in the labour market who have mobile working conditions. If we have a situation in which in which it is possible to have exemptions from the labour market directive, then we are going to have more and more groups who will be able to maintain that specifically their own workforce should be exempt. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that it is a very good thing that we have obtained these two reports. I want to give them my wholehearted support, but I want at the same time to draw attention to a third factor. We have to think not only about showing consideration for employees and employers. There are also third parties involved. A high proportion of the groups of employees concerned provide services to consumers or operate utilities on their behalf. We are concerned here, for example, with passengers at risk of travelling in aircraft flown by tired-out pilots and of patients at risk of being treated by exhausted doctors. This is naturally unacceptable. We must therefore set limits upon what the general public can be expected to accept in this regard. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, of course, accept transition periods of seven or thirteen years. My Group and I should like to have seen us go much further in certain respects, but we are nonetheless satisfied with the developments which have taken place and think that the two reports are excellent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN).</span></span>   – When the 1993 directive on working time was drawn up certain sectors were excluded from its remit and the reason is very clear. It is that the very specific characteristics of some of the sectors concerned required legislation that took these particular characteristics and needs into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus my remarks this evening on the fishing industry, and of course one of the sectors excluded is sea fishing. I share the Council’s view that flexibility in this sector is absolutely essential. Indeed I will go further and call for the exclusion of those workers who are involved in the processing of fresh fish – and I emphasise fresh fish – because there is no continuity of supply when we are dealing with fish. I believe the health and safety of workers must not be compromised. I am not suggesting that, but I believe that protection can best be accorded by an agreement between the two sides of the fishing and fresh fish processing industry. I cannot therefore accept Mr Hughes’ amendment which would place too many constraints on the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishermen must have sufficient holiday time and a maximum limit to working time but I am seriously concerned about the damage to the industry that could result from an inflexible attitude. I would like to stress that neither the fishing industry associations nor indeed any individual fishermen have approached me seeking to be included in the directive. This is an industry which I like to believe that I have a particular affinity to, and appreciation of, coming from a maritime constituency in the north-west of Ireland where fishing is a crucial part of the local economy. My concern is with the families of those trying to make a living. I would call on Mr Hughes and those who feel they want to vote for his amendment to take common sense into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to take the opportunity to refer to the other group – the junior doctors. The hours that this dedicated group of individuals currently has to work in Ireland are unacceptably long. They need to be brought under the correct protection of the directive and I fully support Amendment No 5 calling for a maximum transition period of five years.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As everyone knows, it is effectively about health and safety. Yet it is fraught with problems. Nonetheless it should apply to all workers as an absolute principle, whoever they are. It is easy to see how some people pick on some groups but will not highlight the need for it to be applied to others.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Mrs Smet, who has brought forward this report, having picked it up from the last Parliament, has to accept that as a former Council member she had to accept the common position of the Council which she now rejects. Missing in all this debate quite clearly are the necessary staged processes by Member States. It is after all an inelastic supply in certain circumstances, just as it is with doctors in training. Missing also are the efforts already made in certain Member States. In the UK, for example, proposals are in advance of this directive and have been welcomed by Andrew Hobart, chairman of the junior doctors’ committee who says he is delighted that an understanding has been reached on a new contract for junior doctors which will guarantee safe working hours in advance in the United Kingdom. Deep sea fishing –here is an area unique in its case which proves the rule that this working time directive is fraught with practical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">But, after all, perhaps I can afford a smile. I agree with the principles of this report. I disagree with the estimated effects of all these amendments, but I think that is consistent with my position at all times. It will be interesting to see how some who feel free to pick and choose who should have effective limits on working time and who should not can explain that to the workers affected. Also, what about the emergency workers – paramedics and others. Do not they deserve to be a special case too? So before we get smug in our concern for just certain groups, what about sparing a thought for those others who carry out emergency health care at all times and are also derogated from certain aspects of the working time directive.</p>

Others have referred to particular activities and sectors which are proposed to be covered for the first time by working time regulations. For example, my group colleague, Mrs Lambert, referred to doctors in training and I associate myself totally with her remarks and support the proposals relating to that sector. I do have a concern though that sea-fishermen, especially share fishermen, who are wholly self-employed, will be adversely affected by some aspects of these proposals and I seek some clarification of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Share fishermen jointly own their vessels and are paid solely by share of their catches. Their work patterns are dictated by factors outwith any control, such as weather conditions and fish movements, and therefore it is difficult to imagine how restrictions on working time could possibly be practical in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, health and safety issues are a major reason for limiting working time but fisheries is already subject to codes of practice and to regulations which are monitored by competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Share fishermen up to now have been assured that their unique circumstances would be catered for through exemption. I believe that share fishermen must continue to be regarded as a special case and not subjected to impractical regulations. I will be taking full account of the potential impact on fishermen of the various proposals and amendments before casting my vote tomorrow. I will be listening very carefully to the summing up of this debate for indications that the needs of share fishermen particularly can be accommodated satisfactorily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can see this on a large scale in the fight for new agreements in the World Trade Organisation and on a small scale in the fight over working hours within the EU Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Employers would like to think that workers are always available, even after more than 8 consecutive hours or in the evenings, at nights, Saturdays and Sundays. Paid work is still seen as a commodity. Safety and conditions at work, despite improved legislation, still leave a great deal to be desired. In fact, the efforts required are invariably more demanding than before. Working has increasingly become a type of top-class sport. Only few will sustain it in the long term. Many burn out long before their pensionable age due to overworking.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we desperately need to protect <span class="italic">all</span> workers against wear-and-tear, accidents, overworking and lack of consecutive time off which can be spent as one chooses. This should be a right for everybody, without exceptions. </p>
<p class="contents">Employers, however, keep pressing for exemptions: exemptions for weak industries which have grown big on the back of production costs kept too low and their nineteenth-century industrial relations. As long as we tolerate this, there will be groups of workers who are discriminated against. In the case of industries which rely on this, there is something wrong. This applies especially to road transport which is far too cheap and passes an increasing amount of business risks onto the transport operators by forcing them to join the ranks of the vulnerable self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a coincidence that the exceptions largely relate to mobile workers and people who earn their living at sea in either the fishing or oil industry. After all, it is more difficult for them than their colleagues in other industries to stand up against discrimination, especially as they are not constantly together with their colleagues at a fixed place of work which is easily accessible for the trade-union representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Only in the case of people with special responsibilities and high rewards commensurate with these could it be justified to require, if necessary, working hours that deviate from the norm. If, on the other hand, workers in the weakest positions have to work longer hours, then there is something amiss. This then only happens for the benefit of the competitive battle between companies that work at prices which are too low or that are aiming for profits which are too high. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge that we do not refer the solutions to this problem back to the consultation between the trade union and employers’ organisations since it is precisely the position of parts of these groups of workers that is still too weak. Negotiations do not solve their problems fast enough. This is why exceptions must be deleted, transitional periods must be short and the traditional rights to Sunday rest actively protected and maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the legal grounds speak of the need to harmonise social conditions with progress. I deduce from this then that the overall aim is to bring working conditions into line with those of the more advanced countries of the European Union. Now, forty-eight working hours per week, just one day of rest per week and an eleven hour break between two working days are proposals which already fall short of the gains made in some Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">This directive leaves room for all kinds of exemptions, which make the situation even worse and as a result, it is not acceptable. If it is extended to railway and airline employees, it would even constitute a step backwards, as the legislation in some Member States is more advanced. It is absolutely essential that measures which are favourable to workers and which are in force in certain European countries are not abandoned under any pretext and that includes on the grounds of competition in particular. In France, for example, where women’s night work is very strictly regulated, no European directive should have jeopardised this right which, on the contrary, should have been extended to all European working women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE).</span></span>   – In relation to the working time directive on road transport operators, I have concerns about the exclusion of own-account operators from the definition of mobile workers. For road transport we will now have three categories of operators, own-account, third party hauliers and self-employed with three different working time regimes under Directive 93/104. I suggest that will be inoperable and unenforceable. If tachograph legislation could be rigorously applied would we need the amendment before us, would we need to double the lorries and trucks on the road with the consequent environmental impact? The jury is out.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Amendment No 5 I fully support it. Indeed, in Ireland, we can hang our heads in shame. We have 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors, or junior doctors. The voluntary maximum working hours negotiated by the Irish medical organisation and our department of health is 35 hours per week averaged over their rota period of 46 hours and not more than 72 hours work continuously. Never mind an injection from a doctor on duty for 16 or 18 hours as another speaker mentioned. Who would like to have their baby delivered by a doctor, a junior obstetrician after being on duty for 70 hours? Working continuously for 70 hours is permitted. It is appalling at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s study at the time of the original working time directive stated that in Ireland non-consultant hospital doctors worked well in excess of the 65 hours permitted per week and they undertake tasks indistinguishable from that of their senior colleagues. This study listed issues needing urgent resolution and I will list these briefly – excessive hours worked in several EU countries, on-call duties, – we by the way have problems in Ireland about the definition of on-call. In Ireland, on-call equals on-duty, we need to be very careful of that. The co-shape study also lists unrealistic rostering, protracted periods of continuous duty, the distribution of duties between junior and senior doctors, informal pressure on doctors in training, the vulnerability of breaks and time off and the pace of pressures and service needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, thank you. All I would like to say is in protecting our doctors, we are protecting their patients. This is a health and safety issue of both doctors and their patients. We must stop the exploitation of doctors in training for their sake and that of their patients.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make an altogether separate point of order. My colleague, Mrs Scallon is not here because we understood President Nicole Fontaine to say at the end of the beef debate that the Smet and Hughes reports would be taken tomorrow. There probably is a problem in interpretation here. I understood that, and Mrs Scallon and other colleagues who are not here have been confused by this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is ironic on the eve of the millennium that we are discussing the working conditions of doctors who are working in what could only be described as Dickensian situations. They have long working hours in difficult circumstances with little or no recognition in terms of government policy to the serious difficulties they are encountering. I hope very much that Parliament will clearly indicate their support for the re-introduction of the original time of four years for the inclusion of junior doctors in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is amazing that in this day and age people with such huge responsibilities are working under such difficult circumstances. Mr President, would you get into a plane flown by a pilot who was exhausted and had worked more than 70 hours in a week? I would not, and I am sure no other colleague would either. I was a nurse, I dread to tell you how many years ago, but in those days the technical demands on both doctors and nurses were considerably less than they are now. Now doctors – and, of course, nurses as well, I must make a point for them too – are expected to be highly technologically proficient. We all know how dicey it becomes when we are exhausted doing something as simple as working on our computers. So how much more so dealing with technical issues. These young doctors, these junior doctors, are dealing with serious emergencies in a condition of extreme exhaustion. I hope very much, Mr President, and clearly from the debate so far, our colleagues also share this concern, that they will support all the amendments and I thank Mrs Smet very much for the amount of serious consideration she has given to this particular issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The approval of the proposal without amendments will allow the procedure to be closed once and for all and therefore complete our work in the field of working hours in this maritime sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind Parliament that last June the Council adopted Directive 99/63, which incorporates into Community law the agreement on the organisation of seafarers’ working time, signed by the social partners in the maritime transport sector. And I believe that one of the great successes of this measure is the fact that we are following up an agreement between the social partners themselves, which guarantees – I believe – the effectiveness of this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, both the directive on the agreement and the current draft directive will enter into force on 30 June 2002. This time period is considered necessary so that the Member States may ratify the relevant agreements of the ILO on the hours of work in maritime transport. The ratification of the instruments of the ILO is in fact a necessary condition so that foreign ships which call at EU ports may be boarded for inspection, which will allow us, amongst other things, to prevent unfair competition within our own ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, lastly, I would to expressly thank the European Parliament once again, and especially Mr Hughes, for the work carried out and for your support for the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, Members of Parliament, I would like to congratulate and thank Mrs Smet. I must stress from the outset that today we are discussing the amendment to the directive concerning the branches of workers not included in the directive on the organisation of working time, which has been under discussion for 6 years. It is a very important issue and it has been a political challenge for us to finally come up with a realistic and pursuable proposal. This is what we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the discussions which have taken place following the action by Parliament and the Council of Ministers, I feel that we are now close to that goal. The Commission may accept most of Mrs Smet’s proposals, either fully or in principle. I would like to point out that Amendment Nos 2, 3, 4 and 8 will probably be accepted fully. Furthermore, the Commission will probably agree in principle on Amendment Nos 6, 7, and 9, which may need further clarification in their wording, although we totally agree with their content. Furthermore, it must be made absolutely clear that the Commission upholds the right of initiative as regards the proposals arising from the revisions. </p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore two amendments which are particularly problematic; those concerning practising doctors and those concerning Sunday as a rest day. Most of the speakers referred specifically to junior trainee doctors and to their working conditions. I must stress that there is a great discrepancy between the Council’s proposal and that of the European Parliament, and the Commission has a half-way house proposal to limit the working week to 48 hours within a 7 year transition period. We believe that this proposal can help resolve and ultimately push forward this directive. Of course, this is not totally satisfactory for working doctors, but for this particularly complex problem we must take into consideration the policies of Member States on local national health systems and the different practices as regards the training period for doctors and the required transition period in each country. Then we must endeavour in realistic terms, to find a half-way house solution which will finally allow us to make headway.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns Sunday rest. If the Commission decides to revise the entire directive on the organisation of working hours and, from the outset, to put forward the issues of Sunday rest, which is now a major topic of discussion and one which the European Court of Justice has already delivered judgments on, then there is the danger that this issue may never actually be resolved and that we will again reach a deadlock in our search for the perfect solution. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude to Parliament for supporting the efforts of the Commission on the issue of the directive, but it is clear that we need a conciliation procedure for those important outstanding issues. These issues include transitional provisions for practising doctors, the date for implementation of the whole directive and working hours for the crew of boats working at sea. For two of these issues, sea-fishing and the date of implementation, the Commission supports Parliament’s position. As a result of the issue raised today under Amendment No 10 which is something which has only just come to our attention, I would say that from the initial recommendation of my colleagues, apparently this already exists and is covered in article 17 paragraph 2. However, to be more certain and because this is only our first assessment, I feel that we will be able to provide a concrete answer on this amendment by tomorrow. </p>
<p class="contents">Members of Parliament, I believe that the most important issue and also the most difficult one for this conciliation committee and for finding a favourable solution is the issue of the directive on doctors which I spoke about before. It is my firm belief that, and I am appealing to you all, we must adopt a realistic approach on all sides so that we can all have an effective directive which will act as an initial safeguard for trainee doctors. If, by adopting maximalist approaches and trying to achieve the impossible, we do not in fact reach the required compromise, then I fear that this directive will, for many years, remain on the table without us even making any progress on it. I believe that through this whole conciliation procedure we will be able to make swift headway towards a directive which will, in due course, be voted for by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
