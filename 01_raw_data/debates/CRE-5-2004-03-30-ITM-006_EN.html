The latest outbreak resulted in death and injury and the displacement of 3000 people. It also resulted in the destruction of places of worship, hospitals and schools which were deliberately targeted in an attack on our shared vision of a multi-ethnic Kosovo. While the situation in Kosovo has stabilised since 18 March, it remains very tense. The KFOR international peacekeeping force has been strengthened significantly in response to the violence. I pay tribute to the efforts of all who worked hard to stabilise the situation and to restore calm in Kosovo. I would also like to offer my condolences and those of the Council to all who have once again suffered loss of life, injury and loss of loved ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs and External Relations Council, on 22 March, and the European Council, on 26 March, condemned the violence, loss of life, the damage to property and the destruction of religious and cultural heritage in Kosovo. The full commitment of the European Union to the development of a secure, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 has been reaffirmed once again. The European Union strongly supports the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in Kosovo, Harri Holkeri, the United Nations mission in Kosovo and KFOR in their determined efforts to stabilise the situation and to ensure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1244. I would like to underscore the strong support of the European Union for the United Nations policy of Standards before Status. That policy, together with Security Council resolution 1244, remains the foundation of the international community’s commitment to Kosovo. The European Union is considering how it can strengthen its role in support of the UN Standards before Status policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent violent events have risked undermining the painstakingly achieved progress that has been made to date. It is important now that we assert the primacy of politics in Kosovo and ensure that there is no further descent into ethnic violence. The explosion of sectarianism would be to the detriment of all in Kosovo. It is clear that the future of the people of that country lies in the eventual integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union structures, as agreed at the EU-Western Balkans summit in June 2003. The implementation of the UN Standards before Status policy is the key to achieving that goal. However, the issue of final status in Kosovo can only be addressed once sufficient progress has been made on the implementation and review of standards. Despite the recent violence and the continuing tensions, this will have to include the resumption of the process of dialogue on practical matters between Belgrade and Pristina.</p>
<p class="contents">As this House is aware, at the request of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, High Representative Solana visited Kosovo on 24 March. Commissioner Patten accompanied him on the visit. They took with them a clear message. Political leaders in Kosovo, especially the Kosovo Albanian leadership, need to take responsibility for the situation and ensure that there is no repeat of ethnically motivated violence, or of threats of such violence. Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo’s Provisional Institutions of Self-Government must demonstrate their commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo. Last week’s European Council called on them to take an immediate step in this direction by allocating resources for the urgent reconstruction of damaged property, including places of worship, to ensure that internally displaced persons can return safely to their homes. I welcome the allocation by the Provisional Institutions of EUR 5 million to assist with reconstruction, and the unanimous declaration of the Kosovo Assembly on 26 March to condemn the recent violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Welcome as they are, words are not enough. It is time to see real efforts to reach across ethnic divisions so that a Kosovo in which all can live peaceably and in security is created. To this end, political leaders in Kosovo must now work more closely with the United Nations mission in Kosovo and with KFOR for the protection of the rights of all sections of the population, including members of minority communities.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in Kosovo over the past few weeks is a reminder to us all of the importance of the role that the European Union plays, not just in Kosovo, but in the wider region. The European Union has taken the lead role in working with the countries of the Western Balkans to consolidate peace and stability in the region, and to promote economic development and the respect for human rights and the rule of law. European Union assistance in the region in support of those objectives will amount to EUR 4.65 billion over the period 2000-2006. The Union, including its Member States, continues to be the most important source of funding for the international efforts in Kosovo. Moreover, European Union Member States make the largest troop contributions to KFOR.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of ever closer relations with the Western Balkans is a priority for the European Union. Since last year’s Thessaloniki Summit, the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans have a shared agenda for progress. The objective of eventual integration will be pursued through the Stabilisation and Association Process and through implementation of the series of agreements which brought an end to the tragic conflicts of the past 13 years. In the case of Kosovo, the Stabilisation and Association Process tracking mechanism initiated by the European Commission in the spring of 2003 is designed to facilitate Kosovo’s progress within the Stabilisation and Association Process, bringing Kosovo within the embrace of the European family. Our efforts to promote the European perspective of Kosovo and the United Nations policy of implementing standards are mutually reinforcing policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Process challenges the democratically elected governments of the region to adopt and implement difficult and wide-ranging economic and political reforms, and to continue to strengthen regional cooperation. The rate of progress of the countries of the region towards European integration is to a great extent in their own hands, although the European Union will support them fully in this endeavour. Both sides of the relationship made commitments at Thessaloniki which must be implemented fully.</p>
<p class="contents">Those responsible for the recent violence in Kosovo must be brought to justice. There should be no wall of silence, there should be no culture of impunity. It is time to move forward, away from the hurt and the anger which have blighted Kosovo’s politics for so long. The path to take has been mapped out by the United Nations, in its Standards before Status policy. I would like to repeat the Council’s support for Special Representative Holkeri, for his United Nations colleagues, and for KFOR, in their determination to stabilise the situation and to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 in full. It is the responsibility of all, but particularly of Kosovo’s leaders, to support the work already in train to ensure a stable future for a secure, democratic, prosperous and multi-ethnic Kosovo, with its place in Europe. The European Union is ready to help in the achievement of this goal. It is up to the people in Kosovo now to take up the offers made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the presidency noted, I went with Mr Javier Solana to Kosovo last week, because of our concern about the recent upsurge in violence. During those terrible days and nights, a very large number of homes were destroyed, together with schools, medical facilities and a large number of churches. The latest reports suggest that 22 people were killed and more than 850 injured, including police and KFOR members. There is little doubt that although there may have been an initial trigger for the violence, it quickly became organised. I also have no doubt that elements within the main Albanian political parties were involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that Europe rightly took a stand against the disgraceful ethnic cleansing by Milosevic in 1999. Since then, the international community has spent EUR 2 billion – not including defence costs – to try to rebuild Kosovo. We did not do that in order to see Kosovar Serbs being ethnically cleansed in their turn.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me share with the House my reflections on my visit to Kosovo. I have to say that the High Representative and I were extremely disappointed. We saw at first hand the anger and upset of Serbs in a suburb of Pristina called Kosovo Polje. We were looking for evidence that Kosovar Albanian leaders understood those feelings. There was precious little sign of it. On the contrary, there was an attempt to blame everyone but themselves for what had happened.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one exception to this. The Prime Minister, Mr Rexhepi, rose to the occasion. He showed considerable courage in visiting trouble spots to try to defuse tensions. He also immediately understood the responsibility of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government to put right the terrible wrongs that were done to Kosovar Serbs. Before we arrived, he had decided to set up a reconstruction fund with an initial budget of EUR 5 million. He understood that it was the duty of his government to put things right, not the responsibility of the international community. I did not go to Pristina to promise that European taxpayers’ money would be used instead. That would be completely unacceptable. Mr Rexhepi promised that rapid action would be taken to repair damaged property so that people could get back to their homes as quickly as possible. Mr Solana and I promised to go back through the summer so that we could see for ourselves that progress on reconstruction is actually occurring.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the priorities now? NATO has reacted swiftly to increase troop numbers in order to provide better security. This has had an immediate effect on calming tensions in Kosovo, although we have to remain extremely vigilant about the situation. Next, UNMIK police are trying as quickly as possible to identify those responsible for these attacks so that they can be taken out of circulation and punished. It is incumbent on the leaders of the Albanian political parties to purge their ranks of such people. Next, there needs to be an investigation of the role played by the Kosovo police service in the disturbances. There were reports that some members of the police service did their duty well, but there have also been reports of police service members either taking no action to prevent these attacks or, worse still, participating in them. UNMIK is determined to get to the bottom of what actually happened. Next, we have to be quite clear that we stand fully behind UNMIK. There were clear signs of organised attacks on UNMIK property and staff. That is completely unacceptable. The European Union strongly supports the UN as an institution. We cannot tolerate attacks on the UN, whether in Kosovo or anywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to work very closely with our United States partners. Mr Solana and I had a very constructive meeting with Marcie Ries, the American Representative in Pristina. We all agreed that we needed to make it absolutely clear to the Kosovars that we are at one in our reaction to these events. Finally, it is absolutely essential that the political leaderships in Belgrade and Pristina refrain from provocative statements which can only serve to exacerbate tensions. Final status discussions are for another day. Last week’s declaration by the Serbian Parliament insisting on permanent sovereignty for Serbia and a system of cantons inside Kosovo was extremely unhelpful, to say the least. So were statements by Kosovar Albanian leaders in the immediate aftermath of the violence that they would not accept anything short of independence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is always tempting after horrible events like these to conclude that we should rip up our strategy and come up with a new plan. I must be absolutely clear with the House on this: I do not believe that we can give up on our insistence on a multi-ethnic Kosovo in which all ethnic groups can live freely and without fear. Nor do I believe that we should abandon the idea of standards before status. On the other hand, we should not send a signal that final status discussions will be delayed indefinitely. That would risk a grave worsening of tension.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing that happened earlier this month can change the geography of Kosovo. We all have a shared interest in making sure that Kosovo does not become a black hole in the middle of south-east Europe, where organised crime flourishes and ethnic division is entrenched. We have to go on working patiently for the long-term future. Whatever Kosovo’s final status, its future lies in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the standards we insist that Kosovo should implement and live up to do not include the speed at which you can burn down your neighbours' home, or how quickly you can trash the school or the hospital that your neighbours go to. We have to make it absolutely clear that violence is not a shortcut to anything, and that if people follow leaders who espouse violence they are following those leaders into a future of poverty and criminality – not a future with the rest of Europe. I hope that point will be understood and that the community will turn its back on violence and move towards stability, prosperity, multi-ethnicity, pluralism and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1999, we went to war to stop the expulsion and repression of the Albanians in Kosovo. I was in favour of that; after all, I had visited the country and its people since 1990 and had experienced terrible things, including torture, experienced the apartheid regime for myself. I naively believed that everything would then improve. I could not imagine that the same Albanians who had suffered all that would now do the same wrongs to their fellow human beings of other nationalities – Serbs, Roma, Ashkali. They did, in the end with obviously planned and criminal acts of violence. Many people died or became refugees and cultural heritage was desecrated. What is more, they then attacked hospitals and schools, which we had probably helped to pay for, KFOR and UNMIK. It is clear who was behind it. I believe the ordinary Albanian people know, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Albanian leadership’s protest and distancing of itself was not loud enough or convincing enough for me. This terrible act of violence has set Kosovo back a long way. Is that how it wants to join the EU, as Mr Patten said? The criminals there do not want to join the EU; they do not want to live together in a civilised manner. They want strife because strife gives them scope for corruption and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything is now in ruins. I do not believe that the international community has pressed hard enough for those Serbs who want to return to do so; it has not provided all the necessary accompanying measures. I would not want to return to an enclave either, neither would I want always to have to be protected by KFOR. That is why not enough has been done here. We need to think about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The government in Belgrade has deliberately prevented the local Serbs from being actively involved in shaping Kosovo. It has established parallel structures, fearing that Serb involvement in Kosovo would be the seal of Kosovo’s independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that ‘Standards before Status’ is the only way; so far, it has led us astray. It should be ‘Standards and Status’. We must now set about solving the questions of status. The powder keg of Kosovo will not be kept under control without a trustworthy vision for the future. Sixty per cent of the population are young people and 50% of them have no work. How are we to deal with that when leaders come along who are always stirring things up because Kosovo’s future is not clear?</p>
<p class="contents">We should give some thought to whether we should not press on more with privatisation and support for businesses, offering financial assistance for jobs that are open to both Albanians and Serbs like in Serbia under Milosevic – similar to the ‘oil for democracy’ plan. So let there be financial assistance for that; I believe this is where the EU could prove useful.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN must relinquish more of its responsibility to the government in Kosovo and Belgrade must put an end to its parallel structures. Then Albanians and Serbs will at last have to see that they can only govern the country together and that they will only be able to join Europe together, in a country where they have made peace and live together peacefully. Otherwise, any aid from us will really be pointless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, quite considerable progress has been made in the material situation. Not least, I am pleased to say, because of the good work done by the Reconstruction Agency. Secondly, the United Nations is doing a good job there, albeit hampered not least by excessive bureaucracy. Hardly anything has changed, however, in the heads of the political representatives of the various ethnic groups in Kosovo. That is true of the Serbs, as becomes clear when you look at how little real cooperation there is between the ministers in the Rexhepi government and when you consider that there is still a parallel structure for the Serbs. It is true above all, however, of the representatives of the Albanian majority in Kosovo. With perhaps a few exceptions, which the Commissioner has mentioned, they are unfortunately not yet prepared to agree to a multi-ethnic state, and not only to agree to it verbally but also to make it reality.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are saying, Commissioner, that we must start negotiating soon, and if Mrs Pack is saying that we must actually negotiate about status and standards simultaneously, then I have to ask you, what are we in the European Union doing to persuade the Albanian leadership in Kosovo that they really must accept a multi-ethnic state? The President-in-Office of the Council has said that we are the biggest donor, we have the largest military presence. Why should I have to persuade a European taxpayer to continue providing money for a state whose only aim, or whose political leadership’s only aim is <span class="italic">de facto</span> to create an ethnically pure state in Europe? Why should we, equally, subsidise and support Belgrade if Belgrade is not prepared to accept a joint multi-ethnic entity (let us say) or a multi-ethnic state? I have always advocated moving towards independence for Kosovo, but is the Albanian leadership in Kosovo doing its part for that independence, namely creating the conditions for it? After all the things you have rightly said, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, we must draw the obvious conclusion. If the worst comes to the worst, we must withdraw our support if we find things are going the wrong way.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not help things here with fine words. They may be hearing the fine words, but the leadership is not taking any notice. That is why, however much I agree with what you said, Commissioner, and you were perfectly right, I believe we must now look to the Council and the Commission – but in the end chiefly to the Council – not simply for words, but for action if the Albanian leadership in Kosovo and also the Serbs are not prepared to work on a joint project for Kosovo. I still do not see that happening. I am really looking to the Council and Commission to act accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us remind ourselves. Almost exactly five years ago, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia without declaring war. Although all the parties to the Helsinki Final Act had committed themselves to recognising the territorial status quo in Europe, the country was systematically dismembered by internal and external forces along ethnic lines; the Federal Republic of Germany led the way with its early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapid disintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia did not bring an end to the conflicts, but gave rise to new tensions, which are now again exploding in bloody clashes in Kosovo. What was proclaimed five years ago as the remedy for ethnic cleansing has proved to be the opposite. Thousands of Serbian families have been driven out of a province that is still legally part of Serbia, mainly by paramilitary forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), once classed by the US as a terrorist organisation. It also sounds very strange when Mr Solana, our High Representative, tells the remaining Serbs that they should be brave and have the courage to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Crimes are being committed, and they must be treated as such. The EU must have the courage to speak out more resolutely for a long-term, complex political solution for Kosovo and for the whole of the Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The possibility of this happening was known to anyone who has followed the situation in Kosovo over the past year. From the huge mountain of reports and media reports, the same old image emerges: no real prospects, increasing hopelessness, growing social-economic problems and the UNMIK, which is considered increasingly less as a liberator and more as an occupier, being part of the problem and not part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I too find it far too easy only to point at the extremists. Of course, they are behind the attacks – which are also in my opinion sickening – on Serbs, their villages and their churches, but feelings of disappointment and distrust, but also aggression, are widely spread among the population. That is why I would like to repeat here the appeal Parliament made in its last report on this region, and addressed to the Commission and Council: give an outline of what the options for the future are and make it clear what, according to the European Union, the different scenarios are, but do not take too long about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to admit that I myself am in favour of the proposals of the so-called independent Kosovo Committee of more than two years ago, in which a case was made for conditional independence. In that respect, the Kosovars who are behind those attacks have done their people a huge disservice. If the Kosovars themselves are unable to keep their own extremists under control, there is no hope of fulfilling the most important condition for independence, which is respect for minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to have to say this, Mr Roche, but what you are saying is more of the same and the policy you advocate has led to these problems. As I see it, the status quo – doing what we are doing now – is no longer an option at present. However, the message of this Parliament to the Kosovars and the Kosovan authorities should also be clear: let your people not be taken hostage by a few criminal troublemakers. Be brave in your rejection; say much more clearly than you have done to date that this is unacceptable, but also take this one brave message to your people: Kosovo must be tolerant, or else Kosovo will cease to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only peace and democracy are being challenged but also the dignity of the person and respect for a common cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">The destruction of monasteries in Kosovo, carried out with the sole aim of destroying the symbols of a culture that has the same roots as the European Union, shows how there is a set political agenda at the basis of international terrorism and the resulting guerrilla warfare in some countries, against which our inertia is not just a sign of dangerous weakness but also a harbinger of further tragedies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must step up its presence in Kosovo and call on the Albanian, Serbian and Montenegrin authorities to defend the rights of the minorities and protect Serbian Orthodox cultural sites. It does not make sense to have quite rightly protested against the Buddha being destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan if then the politicians and intellectuals remain shamefully silent about the destruction of so many Orthodox churches and monuments, which belong to a culture that embodies the values that we are endeavouring to protect. The valuable frescoes that have for centuries adorned the Orthodox temples and monasteries in the Balkan region are the heritage of humankind as a whole and must be safeguarded and protected from any risk of destructive folly, as we have stressed in our resolution. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs did well to make more men available to NATO to strengthen the contingent charged with keeping the peace and guaranteeing safety. For its part, the United Nations should provide for a programme to reconstruct the destroyed resources and to outline Kosovo’s final statute. What we also want, however, is a stronger presence for Europe, and this is why we would point out that a European army, as called for by the Convention, is an objective that cannot be put off any longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, our governments justified this violation of international law by invoking the need to avoid ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population and the plan to turn Kosovo into a peaceful, multicultural society. This was, in particular, Dr Kouchner's ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years later, reality has brutally shattered this Utopian dream. The billions spent by our countries, as Mr Patten mentioned just now, and the thousands of soldiers we are deploying there are not preventing the Muslims from ethnically cleansing the 200 000 Serbs still living in Kosovo. Rather than issuing soothing statements dismissing both the victims and the culprits without pronouncing in favour of either, our leaders should think about their responsibility. Above all, they should put an end to this violation of international law, which Serbia has a right to see respected, as do the other states in the region. This is all the more true because our people are not safe from the tragedy now afflicting the Kosovar Serbs.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty years ago, Albanian Muslims were still in the minority in this province, which is the historic heart of Serbia. A few decades of socialism, Albanian immigration and a falling birth rate among the Serbs reversed the proportions: the Serbs became a minority in their own land and are finally being driven out of their homes, their fields and their churches.</p>
<p class="contents">Many regions in our countries are undergoing the start of this process. Some districts, like here in Strasbourg, or even whole towns now have a Muslim majority and are gradually escaping from our laws and being taken over by gangs that will be succeeded by Sharia law. The tragedy in Kosovo is sounding a warning. We must change policy. European comrades, do not ask for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for thee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What was actually positive was the speed of the response from the international community, and the European Union in particular, but also from various EU Member States who quickly reinforced the military forces on the ground there and managed to stop the violence from escalating any further.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people here have already said that we must continue to encourage those responsible in Kosovo itself, but also the people in Serbia and possibly in Albania as well, to participate in finding an achievable solution. I subscribe to the comments made by fellow MEPs pointing out the stalemate that has arisen in Kosovo. As a result, many people can no longer see a way out; this situation also gives those who want to cause trouble and who have created the recent problems the opportunity to do so. I think that we need to pay particular attention to the socio-economic situation. The high levels of unemployment in the country are severely hampering the chance of finding a solution to the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain, however, convinced that we must continue to work towards a society in which the two ethnic groups can cooperate and live together, and I am also of the opinion that the ethnic groups can be called to account about their responsibilities. An answer to the question as to what the definitive status of Kosovo should be, can, however, only be given once we have achieved a kind of internal stability that engenders trust and once there is a conviction that the two ethnic groups can live together peacefully. Until such time as this happens, I fear that the international community, we ourselves in other words, will have to stay on there and that we will regularly have to take action in the way we have done over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mr Patten that this is a European risk which requires a European answer. We cannot allow a black hole to develop in that part of Europe, and that is why it is also so important for us to have responded the way we did. We should also, however, think about what might have to be a harder line in the future in order to ensure that we achieve a breakthrough in the stalemate I was talking about earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I also state clearly that I am absolutely in favour of a multiethnic Kosovo. I would prefer to call it Kosova, which is the Albanian term for Kosovo. I agree with Mr Joost Lagendijk when he said that it was inevitable that violence would break out sooner or later in Kosova. Anyone who has ever visited the divided city of Mitrovica knew that it would take little to trigger an uprising. The riots and lynch mobs were easy to anticipate. It is therefore necessary to take the wind out of the sails of the hard-liners among the Kosovar Albanians.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this, we must eliminate the traumas. Traumas from the past, traumas from the exodus of 1999, the traumas that still haunt the Albanian Kosovars concerning their almost 4 000 missing friends, acquaintances, brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers. Four thousand people are still missing. They have either disappeared or they are still locked up in Serbian prisons on very vague charges. Traumas from the present as well. Is it not true that in the north the international community is in fact applying the secret pact between Milosevic and the Russian generals in which the north of Kosova actually becomes Serbian territory? Whichever way you look at it, the Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica, 85% of the population, are still being held hostage by the Serbs. Unemployment in the Albanian part is two-and-a-half times higher than in the Serbian part. The Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica in the southern part earn two-and-a-half times less than the Serbs in the northern part.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community’s official standpoint is still <span class="italic">standards</span> before status. I would therefore like to call for a ‘both-and’ approach. We must aim for both <span class="italic">standards</span> and status. Only an independent Kosova will bring true peace to the region. At least, as long as multi-ethnicity is also respected by the Albanian Kosovars. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
