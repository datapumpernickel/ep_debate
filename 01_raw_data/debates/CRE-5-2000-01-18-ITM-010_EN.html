<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Hulten (PSE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission. On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility". Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team. The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal. Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office. Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function. A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted. In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods. New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials. The number of departments has been reduced. The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated. The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential. In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.</p>
<p class="contents">First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved. One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control. The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control. A new independent audit system service must be set up. DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities. In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time. Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes. But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia. Urgent change is required today.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive. This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud. OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions. A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, standards in European public life must be upheld. The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct. A number of codes have since been introduced. They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding. The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions. Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected. At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers. They must be implemented without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong. Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission. Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised. It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation. The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue. A career with the European institutions must become more attractive. Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years. Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for promotion to a higher grade. The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed. It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions. It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform. This communication must contain a clear timetable. With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be. Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away. Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions – as the independent experts might have said – a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism. There is a very simple way to deal with those stories. Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about. All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so. I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken <span class="italic">en masse</span> in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe – and I shall only pick up on a few ideas<span class="bold"> </span>– that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament’s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should. </p>
<p class="contents">It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation. Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else. I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State. We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways. I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence. I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957. The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore. Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.</p>
<p class="contents">Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge – not the 1996 – on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September. Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored. Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials. Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency. We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly. While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true – namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information. This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission. Have the lessons not been learnt?</p>
<p class="contents">The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee. We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package. The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like. We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men’s report should be implemented. We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men’s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted – when we had our hearings last September – should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission. We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world – a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred. In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available. We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible. Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget. We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions. But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation. Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report. It is an excellent report. It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues. It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced. Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse. Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far. He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change. Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility. It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation. That is important. We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another. Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible. We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal. This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service. I will give you one example of this. In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million. It is clear that is not acceptable. What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation? We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit. We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working. But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated. We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history. We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves. Our own staff policy is outdated. Some of our working practices need radical reform. I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting. We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public. European taxpayers need to be re-assured. The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform. That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments. I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament – as already stated by Mrs Morgan – that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run. We have submitted an amendment to this effect. </p>
<p class="contents">From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly. Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents. The Commission’s records leave a great deal to be desired. We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out. Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen. If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about <span class="italic">ex post</span> financial control. This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented. The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad. It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure. Is this possible? I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out. If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is his first report here in plenary. This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late. In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control. Let us be honest. The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September. We are now four months down the line. Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round. He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round. My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report – today of all days – on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope. Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening? </p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon’s plenary meeting to embellish this report. After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report. So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable. In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men. </p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today. I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February. I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission. I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere. They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow. Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system. This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States. But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States. Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating. </p>
<p class="contents">After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced. Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem. It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects. It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour. </p>
<p class="contents">In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population. This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used – just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it – to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism. </p>
<p class="contents">Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report – which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points – was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to<span class="bold"> </span>follow up the offences detailed in this report. It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use. </p>
<p class="contents">Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board<span class="bold"> </span>and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state. Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.</p>

Expenditure must be monitored much more closely, both within the Commission and the Member States. For this purpose, the European Court of Auditors and national courts of auditors must work together more effectively. There is also the need to set up a scheme for so-called whistle-blowers. We fully support all these recommendations. I would like to make some observations, however. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the conclusions drawn by the Committee of Wise Men is that the current legal framework for fighting fraud at the expense of the European Union is incoherent and incomplete. How should we deal with this? Not by depriving the Member States of judicial powers and transferring these to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. This kind of procedure presupposes the existence of European criminal law and there is no such thing. Moreover, this goes to the very heart of the Member States’ sovereignty. We should therefore look to solve this problem by means of improved cooperation between the Member States at judicial level. It could be coordinated by a kind of European Public Prosecutor who is not involved in prosecution but passes criminal offences on to the national legal authorities.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee of Wise Men’s report also has some necessary points to make to the Council and Parliament. For example, the Council should attach far more importance to the Commission’s discharge procedure. Also, Parliament should take up the gauntlet. It is high time that regulations were drawn up for Members and that travel expenses are reimbursed based on actual expenses. The question arises as to whether Parliament is in fact prepared to find a way out of this impasse. This week, the Rothley opinion was discussed within the Legal Affairs Committee and there was nothing to indicate any such willingness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission. I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive. There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks. This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue. Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points. Allow me to start with the most important demand. We do not want financial control to be abolished. The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise. The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example. It may well be easy enough to change the Commission’s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have exact figures, but the Community’s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office. This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee. Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms. As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service – also known as the audit service – which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office. </p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten’s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled. A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature. There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague. I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him. I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission’s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy. The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one. </p>
<p class="contents">I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed. A lack of responsibility, too much <span class="italic">ex ante</span>, not enough <span class="italic">ex post</span> and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending. It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis. </p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission’s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change. Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years. This is the best support we can give to European democracy. If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time. Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts. There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the Commissioners’ individual responsibility. This must be regulated during the IGC. However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts. This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution. We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well. Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens. This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents. It now appears that this desire is more serious. After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February. This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament. Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process. We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense. Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office. Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties. Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise. I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed. We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future. Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent – and I stress, independent – prior approval. Up until now, the Commission’s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa. And so it is the “two key” principle that applies here. A single key is to suffice in future. The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission. If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective. This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp. It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all. Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk. The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the financial controllers must work independently. That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation. It is obviously the Commission’s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want. Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks. That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to. Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow’s vote. Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise. This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion. When I read Mr van Hulten’s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air. There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership. There is no backbone, and no teeth. Where is the beef? And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British. Romano Prodi promised a revolution. You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts! Sort out the tangle of staff allowances. Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool. Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool. Do not listen to the report’s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed. It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others. We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing. </p>

So I refer to the things I do not agree with.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament. This report is about the Commission. Parliament is a separate subject. There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free. That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports. It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the report is about financial control. That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee. But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission. After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending. We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States. So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money. We should get it into perspective. It is important to remember that.</p>
<p class="contents">The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money. They have very little of it. They have a much wider responsibility. That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust. If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year. I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs. That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were. This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it. While there were problems – and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance – we sometimes take the negative side too far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work. The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission. The Commission’s administration simply does not function particularly well. Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform. There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy. People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable. The Financial Regulation should be amended. We agree that we should have better control of the finances. It is just a question of how. The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with <span class="italic">ex ante</span> financial control. We should be careful about this. We should retain some form of <span class="italic">ex ante</span> financial control. It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent. This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through. Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not have enough staff. As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission’s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it. And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs. The staffing system is too rigid. There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy. It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees. I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed. After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps this is a little worrying. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved. We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented. Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough. There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent. I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised. What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States. These are what are missing. We have asked for a Public Prosecutor’s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU. We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman’s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice. The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles. The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action. It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation. We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF’s job. Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents. Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this. I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments. I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic. I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments. I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur’s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration. A very important proposal indeed. I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether. I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale. On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes. I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock. He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary. In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of officials. Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder’s view. I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately. First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement. For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission. These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.</p>
<p class="contents">In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members. The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups. </p>
<p class="contents">According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts. In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States. This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions. </p>

Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them. Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Long-winded’. I am not going to mention the length of this report. I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.

When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them. Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control. The concept of transparency stands out in the report. Securing this is a major priority. The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough. This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens. We must win back their faith in EU politics. The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them. This is what enables them to understand what is going on. They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served</p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission’s own initiative. However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis. However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control. I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's – it was the decision of this Parliament! So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House. She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report. Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official – and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions. I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence. Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals. Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago. I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that. The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes – I say to him and to Mr Staes – a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform. There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.</p>
<p class="contents">The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance. I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode. But he will appreciate – with his customary generosity I am sure – that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing. Hence the transmission. Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations. The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does. This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public. Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible. I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning. That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform. As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures. Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate. We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures. The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital. I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Change in the law is fundamental. There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system. Essentially – and with legal change – the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service –“the second key” as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts. That service will open on 1 May this year. It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation. The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening. As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors. This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them. The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach". Financial control’s ex ante visa for each spending department will <span class="italic">only</span> be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts. That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa. It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997. Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson’s comments to this House last month. “The Commission's internal control” he said “is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation. For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered. At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General.”</p>
<p class="contents">The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions. I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this. I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition. That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document. Our objective, the committee’s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.</p>
<p class="contents">Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing. As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities. We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line. The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed. We are seeking to implement best practice. Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure. As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.</p>
<p class="contents">A communication later this year will give full details. I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose. I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability. We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism. And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board – something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament. A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.</p>
<p class="contents">Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House. With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework. This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life. That is in line with the draft resolution. An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions. I welcome Parliament's support for that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament. President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that. I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents. The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors. I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament. We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text. We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform. I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals. I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions. It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities. Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.</p>
<p class="contents">While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential. A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months. Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House. It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters. The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change. That is most certainly relevant. We are sure that there will be an important “reform dividend” as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources. It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched. Parliament has frequently made that point. Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology. Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken. They are already having implications for resource availability.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that if we take on new tasks – which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament – we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity. A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management. I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions. We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.</p>
