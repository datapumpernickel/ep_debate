<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Boetticher (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today sees the fulfilment of a small dream. I have ten minutes' speaking time, as much as only a Group chairman can normally expect. This, however, comes about through the grouping together of two reports, which do not actually belong together. So I would prefer to speak on them separately.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with the area of civil law. When the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, judicial cooperation in civil matters became a matter of common concern for the Member States. Then the Treaty of Amsterdam, by means of Article 65 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, transferred this cooperation from the third pillar to the first. Its entry into force brought about active European lawmaking. Regulations on conflicts of law or of jurisdiction were adjusted, the Council directive on insolvency procedures and on the service of legal documents in civil and commercial cases was adopted, and draft directives on the gathering of evidence and on rights of access in matrimonial cases were submitted to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the present Treaty of Nice means that future decisions on judicial cooperation in civil matters will finally be reached by codecision procedure with qualified majority in the Council. You can see that things in this field are developing at breakneck speed. Member States will continue to have sole responsibility for the framework and content of professional training in civil law, but it will be the Community's responsibility to support them whether in the removal of obstacles to the application of Community law or in the cooperation of the judicial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In no area of European law is continuing professional education so imperative as in civil law, in which harmonisation has already made progress. Criminal and administrative law, on the other hand, are still only at the beginning of their European development. This continuing education was formerly supported by two EU programmes. GROTIUS, the joint incentive and exchange programme for the legal profession, came to an end in 2000. This promotion was maintained only by a successor programme, GROTIUS Programme Civil, which was limited to one year. The same year saw the expiry of the Robert Schuman Project, which had been limited to three years and served to make lawyers more aware of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal before us today now represents the legal basis for further financial support for activities in the field of legal cooperation in civil matters. It promotes judicial cooperation and improved mutual understanding of legal systems, as well as measures to transpose and implement Community legislation in this area and better information for the public. For the first time, alongside finance for specific projects, there is the prospect of financial help with the running costs of European NGOs. I can only emphatically support that.</p>
<p class="contents">The facilitation of involvement by the acceding countries is also especially to be welcomed. Apart from the essential rejoicing at the direction of this draft, which is made all the greater by the generous financial framework amounting to EUR 14.5 million up to 2006, there remain a few critical points. The stipulation that NGOs can only apply for support if two-thirds of the Member States participate in them can hardly be complied with even today. The prospect of enlargement therefore makes it a matter of urgency to reduce this hurdle to one-third, or else this directive's good beginnings will be nipped in the bud.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wonder why the Commission, contrary to its former practice – for example in the context of the GROTIUS programmes – has omitted to define precisely who is entitled to apply, members of the legal profession in this case. The debate on the money-laundering directive showed us how vital it is in this area to define terms. Member States must not have discretion to define terms when support with European funds is at issue. I have therefore proposed the adoption of the old definition from the GROTIUS civil law programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say, on this point, that I would have been glad if the EU had continued to bear up to 80% of project costs, rather than reducing this share to 50%. This was, however, not what the relevant committee wanted. I think, though, that the EU continues to bear a great responsibility for the further development of judicial cooperation. This responsibility is likely to increase rather than decrease in the future. Here, too, we must continue to be a motive force.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the first part concerning the area of civil law; I now come to the debate on the Schengen Information System.</p>
<p class="contents">The Schengen Information System was established in 1995 on the basis of the Convention of 1990 which implemented the Schengen Agreement. Today, as a police investigation system overlapping states and supported by computers, it facilitates online access to over 8 million items of data produced by investigations and is thus the most comprehensive database in Europe. It is used by Iceland and Norway as well as thirteen EU Member States. All this makes SIS a successful component of a new European internal security policy, made necessary by the dismantling of internal borders and the resulting loss of surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">Two problems concern us today, the first being advances in technology. The Schengen Information System as we know it today was originally conceived for eighteen Member States. The fact that all the present acceding countries will join in SIS on their accession makes it urgently necessary to give thought today to what will be its successor. Technology has moved on in the meantime as well. The initiative taken by the kingdoms of Sweden and Belgium to develop SIS II are therefore much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">As the development of SIS II will require over three years' preparatory work, these initiatives lay the necessary legal foundations for its budget. The originators have, however, overshot their mark a bit. In order to ensure the maximum influence on technical development, the Member States are to take part in the comitological process through a combination of administrative and regulatory committees. This will therefore involve a maximum of additional bureaucratic effort.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not clear to me why, at a development stage where only technical aspects are to be discussed, the Member States are to join in discussing and deciding on every detail. The suggestion that a regulatory committee should be in place to deal with all matters concerning the system's architecture and with data protection issues, also goes against Council decision 468/99. This stated that recourse should be had to the regulatory procedure only for measures of general scope intended to apply essential provisions of basic legal instruments. Such is quite evidently not the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I would like to point out to the representatives of the Council that, for example, when Eurodac was set up, there was deliberately no official participatory procedure, and the Member States exerted their influence only through an informal network of technical experts. This saved us all a great deal of time and money and still produced an effective result. At the same time, I have confidence in the technical know-how in this field possessed by the Commission, which is entrusted with guiding this development.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore suggest to Member States that they replace the superfluous bureaucratic combination of administrative and regulatory procedure by a combination of administrative and consultative procedure. Less is sometimes more.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is the development of law. The Member States did admittedly decide as early as the Amsterdam Inter-Governmental Conference to integrate the Schengen Agreement into the European legal area, but lack of agreement meant that the Schengen Information System was assigned to the third pillar. There is no doubt, however, that collection of data on persons who have been barred from entering a Member State is within the scope of the first pillar. This is another reason why we have two initiatives today, one by the Belgian Presidency and another by Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">As Europe's Parliament, we strive to integrate Schengen and the Schengen Information System into the first pillar, and as a whole if at all possible. It is only in that way that appropriate parliamentary control can be guaranteed. So I will go on the record as welcoming, as a step in this direction, the financing of Schengen II out of Community funds with effect from 2002. The initiative unfortunately forgets to submit to Parliament the Commission's half-yearly interim reports on the stage the development has reached. It is scarcely comprehensible that the budget procedure of the European Community should be applied to finance Schengen II without the body legislating for that budget – namely Parliament – being informed about these developments at the time. However much the direction taken by the report's contents may be worthy of approval, in this respect there must be clear improvement. Apart from that, I can only give my full and wholehearted support to the proposals as a whole. I crave your indulgence for having to leave in about a quarter of an hour – as indeed must other ladies and gentlemen – but we have a meeting of the Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. We have some votes to take part in there as well. So there is no disrespect for this House.</p>

I should like to focus on the second report that deals with the Schengen system, which has come before Parliament not for reasons of clear political will, but because the Council has not been able to achieve unanimity on maintaining the system of intergovernmental funding, whilst a source of Community funding is also necessary. These are the peculiarities of our work in the European institutions: many things happen for strange reasons and as a result of stopgap solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that this proposal to develop a new generation Schengen Information System, SIS II, can only be accepted as the first, preparatory, stage in the system’s development. Community funding will not solve the problems that divide us in our analyses of the functioning of the SIS. It is crucial, as I argued here last September, when I presented my report on Schengen, that in addition to Community funding, the Schengen Information System cannot continue to be managed in secret and on a purely intergovernmental basis. It must instead be managed at European Union level by a separate agency. At the same time, a single Community information system must be set up consisting of a computer network system that contains data received under the three conventions, Schengen, Europol and Customs, bearing in mind the need to keep the data held under these conventions separate. This is the only way in which we will be able to guarantee an adequate level of protection for personal data, which is fair and identical for all citizens, complying with the level of protection stipulated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we know that the SIS is reaching saturation point with eighteen States participating, which means that it will not be able to survive beyond the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, which also means that we must rapidly adapt the system. I hope that the five years we have ahead of us will be long enough to present a proposal that is balanced and which meets the demands of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This initiative addresses the objectives of the system, which serves both judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters under the third pillar and the fields of visas, asylum and immigration and others concerning the free movement of people under the first pillar. These initiatives are the real premises of the preliminary work that must be undertaken in order to create the new SIS II system. They have come into being, as has already been stated, as a result of the rejection of intergovernmental funding by some Member States and are based on the Commission’s willingness to take the risk and the political responsibility for going ahead with the development of this new information system in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The SIS, which, as we know, has only been a Community instrument since 1999, has matured very quickly. Although it was designed for twelve Member States, it now serves thirteen plus Iceland and Norway and we now have the United Kingdom and Ireland knocking on the door. As<span class="italic"> </span>we know, in the current historical circumstances, it provides a vital European source of information on citizens of third countries and assets that have disappeared or been stolen, given the immensity of the task of controlling our external borders or movement within any part of Community territory. With the imminence of the new round of enlargement and given the challenges of adapting the new technologies and the new requirements, of which we are all aware, it is crucial that we develop the current system by providing Community funding for its modernisation. The requirement for its development towards the so-called second generation SIS is, today, crucial to detecting threats arising from the situation of third-country nationals, in order to provisionally arrest criminals who qualify for extradition, to help to locate people who have disappeared or been kidnapped, to monitor dangerous individuals and to retrieve stolen goods and assets. I am delighted to have the support of Mr von Boetticher, who has done an excellent job. I also believe that tomorrow’s final vote on this report will produce a text on which it will be much easier for Parliament to agree on an opinion. Mr President, only budgetary funding can give coherence to the new Community nature of the Schengen acquis, of which the current and future information systems are a part. Furthermore, the new requirements for <span class="italic">online</span> and <span class="italic">in tempo</span> judicial information and cooperation should be able to guarantee the security of Europe’s citizens. I therefore feel, Mr President, that we must not get bogged down in the minutiae of accounting procedures or of the law. The important thing is that the SIS moves ahead, to the benefit of the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has produced two excellent reports. He makes a first-class contribution to the work of the committee which I have the honour to chair.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk very briefly about the first of these reports to do with the freedom of movement of people. It is essential that we have a European legal space and that we pursue its development with judicial cooperation in civil matters. The rapporteur quite rightly identifies the problems here and recognises that just as the single market required a massive benchmarking exercise, a massive exercise in approximation and mutual recognition, so too will the development of a European legal space require this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second report the rapporteur looks at the problems that have emerged with the Schengen Information System and the opportunity to move forward to the second version of it, which clearly will be needed with enlargement. We have here, in Strasbourg, with the central Schengen computer system, the most comprehensive databank in Europe. It must be financed from our budget. Sadly, the Belgian and Swedish initiatives, which propose a regulation for the First Pillar and a decision for the Third Pillar, show how ridiculous it is still to be operating with these two pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, Article 96, which is the article governing the data on those refused entry, must be in the First Pillar. It contains the personal details of 1.3 million people and will contain substantially more with enlargement of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would draw the House's attention to the report from Justice last year that found significant defects in data protection, poor quality of data and obstacles placed in the way of individuals seeking to correct mistakes. We must take account of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find it scandalous that the overwhelming majority of the persons listed in the SIS have not been charged with any criminal offence. Only 11 000 people have their names stored in these computers because of an arrest warrant for the purpose of deporting them, but there are 780 000 listed as barred from entering any of the EU's Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 99 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement states that the SIS can also be used to – as it is termed – obtain information in order to repel a significant danger originating from a specified person, or other significant dangers. This provision means that the names of quite blameless citizens are to be found in the SIS computers. This data was, for example, used in issuing demonstrators with unjustified bans on entry when the summit was held in Genoa. As long as this continues, we cannot give any support to the further development of this Schengen Information System. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for what has been gained through Parliament’s work, although we do feel that an essential element, democratic control, is missing. Once again, we are being forced to agree to providing Community funding, as Mr Marinho said, in order to be able to have a say as well. However, we feel that the European Council is continuing to do an appalling job, which, moreover, consists both of greatly increasing the number of databanks, and of greatly increasing the amount of data. We know that, in addition to SIS, there are the – albeit revised – Europol and Eurodac databanks etc., and the latest addition will be the databank containing the index of criminal records used by Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">Hitherto, SIS has been a huge collection of information and notes on people and objects: it contains data entered by each Member State according to different laws and criteria which has been accessible to users at different levels of responsibility. Among the errors which may have already been made, consider the case of the US citizen arrested in Belgium because he had lost his passport whom SIS recorded as a passport thief. Reference has been made to the events in Genoa: thousands of people had been recorded in SIS after the incidents in Gothenburg, but this was of no benefit to the Italian police.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, our view is that there will not only be more States entering data in this bank but also, essentially, more data. Lastly, we do not believe that total control is compatible with the rule of law, as has been maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking on the European judicial area in civil matters. When the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, judicial cooperation in civil matters was transferred from the third pillar to the first, since when the European Community has elaborated an ambitious work programme in that area. A detailed examination of the GROTIUS programme led to the conclusion that a new, more general, framework for activities in this field was needed. The new framework regulation makes it possible to continue the projects already financed by the GROTIUS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I thoroughly welcome this draft regulation by the Commission, which is intended to create a legal basis for the financing of judicial cooperation in civil matters by the EU Budget. For the first time, the framework regulation also makes possible financial support for European non-governmental organisations, provided that these function on a non-profit basis and that their objectives serve to promote judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is greatly to be welcomed that acceding countries and third countries are able to participate in all these activities. The limitation, proposed by the rapporteur and adopted by the Committee, to one-third of the involved Member States, is realistic and far-sighted, especially against the backdrop of the imminent enlargement up to 2006. This regulation does not apply in Denmark, Ireland or the United Kingdom. Legal practitioners in these countries can, however, participate in the projects alongside their counterparts from the acceding countries and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of 'legal advisers' in this regulation has a quite different background from that in the directive on money laundering. For that reason definition by means of a concluding list, as proposed by the rapporteur, would in this case inhibit the flexible use of this regulation in the future and limit its scope. This is true, in particular, because it is difficult to translate correctly into all the Community languages without giving the terms for the relevant legal profession a different meaning, especially since individual Member States might in the future add other types of legal practitioner, who would then be barred from participation. I would therefore prefer it if there were no list of these occupations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It aims to improve police cooperation in criminal law matters, to harmonise immigration and visa policy and to monitor the free movement of persons. This monitoring, though, is targeted not least at migrants, who find it impossible or virtually impossible to travel to the EU legally, and the great majority of whom are fleeing situations that the EU may well not have created on its own but has substantially helped to bring about. As many people have already mentioned today, the system is directed against those of the EU's citizens who incur its displeasure by wanting, for example, at a summit meeting, to express their disapproval of an EU policy which is characterised by lockouts and the capitalisation of essential areas of life.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming clear what this update of the Schengen Information System amounts to. On the one hand, it is about the efficient use of the surveillance which technology and geography make possible. At the same time, the EU wants the mere existence of these possibilities to mean that use is actually made of them. Even the apparently technical changes in these proposals are also about improving the existing surveillance structure, and so this improvement needs to be financed. And here I must disagree with Mr Turco and say that, in my judgment, nothing whatever in this project would be changed even by democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">Seeing this from the Left, I believe this proposal cannot be supported. Basic freedoms perform quite different functions in capitalism. From a quite pragmatic point of view, though, they do guarantee the citizen a minimum of protection from the State. It so happens, in the present situation, that most restrictions on basic rights….</p>

Its Community identity, therefore, implies that any proposal to replace it must be bound by the same legal considerations governing how it was set up and operates and that any extension to its purpose must be subject to full democratic scrutiny by the relevant bodies, as previous speakers have stated.</p>
<p class="contents">The current climate, with the need for additional measures to safeguard our citizens and the inability of the current information system to meet that need, should not provide fertile ground for arbitrary derogations from and extensions to its powers. The proposed legal framework needs to clarify certain crucial issues.</p>
<p class="contents">If natural persons are to be protected against personal data processing, the joint supervisory body set up in the Schengen Agreement needs to be involved. This authority has been commissioned to draft an annual report on how the current system functions, including a systematic review and analysis of the new data which the new system will create. At the same time, the European Parliament needs to step up efforts to ensure that the new system functions are monitored efficiently by calling for regular progress reports. The point here is that, as far as the continuing application of the Schengen Agreement is concerned, the Council has only updated the European Parliament once, meaning that Parliament is unaware of issues which impinge directly on the free and unimpeded movement of citizens or how the Union's borders are controlled.</p>

It has been used with particular enthusiasm every time grass roots resistance movements have been organised against the interests chosen by the European Union, in Nice, in Gothenburg and in Genoa.</p>
<p class="contents">A month ago, the European Parliament requested a progress report in which the rapporteur revealed the arbitrary nature and unreliability of the personal data recorded. A few days later, the European Union rushed to make this information available to the American services to help them stifle any voice of resistance anywhere in the world and spread a new imperialist war on the pretext of fighting terrorism.

<p class="contents">Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we have, in fact, had a particularly ambitious agenda in the field of civil judicial cooperation. By way of example, I would say that over the last two years, five regulations in this field have already been adopted by the Council, and two other proposals are under discussion. Two new legislative proposals are currently being prepared by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this proposal is to contribute to the establishment of a European judicial area in civil matters. The intention is not to propose a new action programme, but to contribute to the successful implementation of the existing action plans in this field, in particular, the Tampere conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the support we suggest in these proposals is aimed not only at co-funding projects carried out by public and non-public institutions and organisations in the Member States, but also at funding Commission actions, such as actions aimed at ensuring the correct application of Community law in the civil field, which I am convinced will be of benefit to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to note that Mr von Boetticher has received our proposal with approval, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments proposed, the Commission accepts four out of the six of them. I am talking about the amendments on the two new recitals proposed by the Committee on Budgets, the new recital proposed by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the amendments on the introduction of a definition of the term ‘legal practitioner’.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendment on the specific objectives of the framework programme, I prefer to preserve the Commission’s initial proposal, because it very closely pursues the objectives set in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 5, I well understand the rapporteur’s argument, but I believe that setting a strict threshold in relation to non-governmental organisations is also a way to promote the existence of genuine European organisations in this field. And I believe that the threshold we are proposing will remain practical, even in the context of the enlargement of the European Union. Furthermore, several non-governmental organisations in this field already play a significant role, including in a very significant number of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in relation to the second report on the Schengen Information System, I believe that this is a key element in the operation of the area without frontiers. The need for a second-generation SIS was recognised some years ago. This need is due, above all, to the limitations of the current SIS system. The system only allows for the integration of 18 countries. This is why the enlargement of the Union requires the development of a second-generation SIS that will permit the full integration of new Member States. Without the SIS II we will not have the conditions appropriate for the lifting of internal border controls in the countries which are currently candidates for accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The two initiatives you are debating today confirm that the European Parliament and the Commission will henceforth have an increased role in relation to the development of the SIS II, both in this initial phase in the field of funding, and in the definition of the future architecture of the system and its specific operation.</p>
<p class="contents">These two initiatives are in line with the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council at the end of May that favoured funding the development of SIS II by means of the Community budget from 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the two initiatives aimed at creating a committee to assist the Commission in the development of the SIS II, the European Parliament will be kept systematically informed of work in progress, by means of the institutional mechanisms for informing Parliament within the framework of commitology.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that, at the request of the Commission, a sum has been included in the 2001 draft budget for preparatory action in relation to the development of the SIS II. Given that this is for preparatory action, and in accordance with the rules on the execution of the budget, the Commission really does not require a legal basis for these preliminary expenses, but it is nevertheless aware that it cannot develop the SIS II without calling on the experience of Member States in relation to the current SIS and its operation. This experience is absolutely essential and the implementation of commitology offers a well-established structural solution with a view to assisting the Commission in its new responsibilities relating to the development of the SIS II.</p>
<p class="contents">If the principle of creating a committee to assist the Commission is acceptable, however, we would like to express our preference for a system of commitology based on the creation of an advisory committee and a management committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased with the amendments proposed by Mr von Boetticher in this regard, and I hope that they will be approved in plenary session.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also prepared to accept the European Parliament’s amendment on the delivery of a six-monthly report prepared by the Commission on the work on the development of the SIS II, not only to the Council but also to the European Parliament. This is not only important with regard to the principle of transparency, but also with regard to the role the European Parliament will have to play within the framework of the legislative measures necessary for the development of the SIS II, which require that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of all work in this area. Because, in fact, the two initiatives we are discussing today relate, above all, to the technical work involved in the implementation of the SIS II. This implementation also requires the adoption, when the time comes, of legislative measures based on the appropriate bases in the Treaties, which the European Parliament will be consulted on. These legislative measures will have to define all the essential elements of the SIS II, in particular, the purposes of the system, the categories of information to be included, the protection of information, control by a common control authority, the management of the future operational SIS II and the issue raised by Mr Coelho of whether or not to create an agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The points I have just highlighted will be the subject of a later debate, when the time comes, on the basis of the results of the feasibility study to be launched by the Commission at the beginning of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason that the Commission cannot support the amendments on these points today is not that we disagree with their content, but simply that to me it seems premature to deal with them within the framework of the two initiatives which are aimed solely at the funding of the development of the SIS II. We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues again and to make decisions, when the time comes, on the basis of legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to conclude with the following positive statement: the development of the SIS II is a task which will concern us in the years to come and which must be achieved within a reasonable timescale that will allow the new Member States to be integrated into it and to thereby create the conditions for them to participate in our common area without frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of your opinion today, within the three months which have followed the delivery of the two initiatives, demonstrates the will and capacity of the European Parliament, of its Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, to contribute to the creation of the SIS II as soon as possible. This gives me great pleasure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
