<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur.</span> – Madam President, I have the honour to bring this report to the House on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. It was felt appropriate for the chairman of the committee to pilot through the House a report on a matter which requires a wide consensus of support. As a Liberal Democrat, I regard terrorist acts as a unique category of crime which negates democracy. They are designed to destroy the very basis of civil society and I am grateful to committee colleagues for their support for this view and for our subsequent recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who see my report as a response to current terrorist attacks on the Iberian Peninsula. I share the profound concern of those who recognise this as an open wound in Europe’s polity and on behalf of the committee I extend to them my deepest sympathy and solidarity. In my mind, however, my analysis and recommendations should be no more and no less a response to the situation there than to similar situations which have existed, and in some cases continue to pose a threat, in Northern Ireland, in the UK, in Corsica, in France, in Germany, in Italy or other countries which have been subject to attack by ideological terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is not a new phenomenon, but today it has many new aspects and features. Links between terrorists in different countries now form part of the fretwork of internationally organised crime. In August, we saw evidence of contacts between terrorists in Northern Ireland and their counterparts in Colombia. Such links enhance the capacity of those who use terror for political ends to find weapons, exchange ideas on techniques and escape the arm of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is also inspired by new motives and new weapons. Some animal welfare groups launch campaigns to terrorise those connected, sometimes only tenuously, to experiments on live animals. Some environmental protection groups harass those involved in oil exploration or exploitation. Computer terrorism and environmental terrorism are worrying features of today’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous attempts by democratic societies to tackle this threat have met with varying success. Where they have signally failed is in the field of international cooperation between law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities. In the case of the European Union, the tools to improve such cooperation are provided by Articles 29 and 31 of the TEU and yet governments have hesitated to use them. Such reluctance is strangely out of place in a Union founded on the values of humanity and dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, respect for human rights and freedoms and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision of Member States to make the Union an area of freedom, security and justice should provide a basis for urgency in tackling a growing terrorist challenge. An unqualified rejection of terrorist organisations and of terrorism should lead to a coherent and binding set of coordinated policies and a spirit of cooperation between governments at all levels. Cooperation between France and Spain or between Britain and Ireland has improved in recent months and yet the opportunities offered by the Amsterdam Treaty for more effective action have not been grasped.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Members from all parties in this House for their generous advice and assistance to me in drawing up this report. The report commands a wide consensus of opinion. I am pleased that it opposes the introduction of exceptional laws and procedures. Such measures should not be necessary. They frequently deprive governments of moral superiority and can descend into instances of state-sponsored terrorism. Herein lies a potential danger to democracy. Where the state is not prepared scrupulously to pursue criminal actions against soldiers or policemen guilty of torture, it has little legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless I am opposed to Amendment No 2, which could be interpreted as justifying terrorism and to Amendment No 1, which would delay action in this fight. I believe that the legal systems of all the EU Member States have the capacity to guarantee justice. That is not to say that judicial standards could not be higher. They could be, and raising them is a major challenge for the Union. Unless we are prepared to trust each other’s judicial systems and democratic practices, however, more and more families will be deprived of their loved ones as innocent people lose their lives to those who murder for political ends.</p>
<p class="contents">My report therefore calls on the Council of Ministers to establish common minimal laws and penalties to counter terrorist acts, to abolish formal extradition procedures for those suspected or convicted of terrorist crimes and to establish a European search and arrest warrant in the fight against terrorist groups. Some may regard such measures as extreme. I believe that all are justified in tackling a form of crime designed to destroy democracy based on the rule of law and I hope that the Commission and Council will respond early to this call for action.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, this part session marks the beginning of a political year which presents us with tasks which could be described as historic: in the coming months we have to launch a constitutional reform of the Union, we are going to introduce the euro and we are going to face the most important chapters in negotiations which will lead to an unprecedented enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For thousands of European citizens, however, these debates pass over their heads. The fundamental concern of these citizens today is that their children receive a pluralist and open education in their schools; that they may safely walk the streets of their towns; that they may be able to publicly express what they think; that they may be able to exercise their right to a free vote; that they may be able to hold a position representing their people, without endangering their lives or those of their families. And these thousands of European citizens rightly expect local, national and European administrations to guarantee their fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it seems to me essential that the Community institutions, as well as dealing with the constitution, the euro and enlargement, respond to what we European citizens, in Spain for example, who live there, consider to be our first priority: the fight against terrorism, that is, the fight for freedom, for respect for human rights and for the rule of law which we Spaniards have built after four decades of dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a common area of freedom, security and justice is what the European Council in Tampere in October 1999 called for. We must congratulate the current Belgian Presidency for having made this one of its priorities, and we place great value, of course, on the laudable work of Commissioner Vitorino, who I hope will find support in this debate for the use of his powers of legislative initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Parliament, the House which represents the European citizens, has had a special responsibility in this task, which our President, Nicole Fontaine, has taken on with a decisiveness and courage that those who have directly or indirectly suffered terror will never forget. I am sure that your successors will have this same attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore also believe that we can be reasonably satisfied in voting for this report today on the role of the European Union in the fight against terrorism, the importance of which is demonstrated by the fact that its rapporteur is the very Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms, Graham R. Watson. He is presenting this House with a text approved in committee by a huge majority, as he has said, and which contains such fundamental considerations as the statement that democratic dialogue must be based on mutual respect and non-violence, or the recognition of the debt that society owes to the victims of terrorist acts and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">In approving this report we are making a series of recommendations which, when implemented, will allow us to create a common definition within the European Union of the crime of terrorism; to adopt the principle of mutual recognition of judgments; to replace the formal extradition procedures with a European search and arrest warrant for those crimes which cause particular revulsion in society. I am talking about terrorism of course, but also human trafficking, crimes against children, illegal drug and arms trafficking, corruption, fraud and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, with absolute respect for all the parliamentary groups, regardless of their political orientation and, of course, for the free vote of Members, I would now ask you to support the report because this is a fundamental issue which goes beyond party disputes. Through the implementation of the measures proposed in it, justice will have more instruments for guaranteeing the fundamental freedoms that formed the basis for the construction of Europe and which have been restricted by terrorism for thousands of Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I feel happy today as a Basque, as a Spaniard and as a European. I am happy because Europe has understood that when ETA violates human rights, when organised Basque fascism commits xenophobic crime and ideological cleansing, when this terrorist organisation, which in Spain today represents the final dying embers of Franco’s legacy, continues to operate, based within Europe itself, it is not a problem for the direct victims, those of us who live with escorts, those who cannot appear on electoral lists, those who have to overcome fear in order to write daily or in order to talk to the media. The problem is for Europe. It is a problem for European democracy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, European democracy is also acting as a whole and is reacting by uniting in the battle against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel happy because Europe has understood that it is time to go beyond words, beyond fine statements, beyond bilateral cooperation, though this is important.</p>
<p class="contents">It has long been time to mobilise the instruments necessary to bring the criminals, the terrorists, the fascists, to justice, to finally arrest the criminals, to implement all the necessary instruments which will make the European democratic institutions more effective in achieving this end.</p>
<p class="contents">It also makes me happy to see that Europe has discovered that, when criminals are at liberty, when organised criminals are attacking human rights, freedoms and lives of citizens, the first political decision that must be taken is to make it possible for the criminals to be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We do everything we have to do to ensure that all citizens live in freedom, regardless of their ideology, their beliefs, their origin, their surnames, their native culture, and everything we have to do to defend – if you will allow me – the very concept behind European citizenship: human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Watson report and its recommendations are not just a commitment against ETA: they are a commitment to democracy. The aim is to beat ETA, but the fundamental commitment is to defend democracy throughout the whole of Europe. To defend the idea that everywhere in Europe people may live in freedom, in plurality, and may live together. And in one place in Europe, in the Basque Country and in Spain, the fascist organisation ETA is jeopardising that coexistence and plurality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that there will be operative problems, that some countries will have problems harmonising their legislations. President Verhofstadt said here, during his first intervention, that those who do not believe in utopia do not deserve to be called Europeans. I believe that a political will which has been capable of introducing a single currency will be capable of also introducing single instruments to fight terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">But please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to end by making a comment in my capacity not just as a European, but as a Basque and a Spaniard. As a Basque and a Spaniard, as the daughter of a generation of Spanish democratic citizens who lost the war against Franco and who resisted forty years of dictatorship, I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that through this act today, Europe is performing an act of historical reparation, because for many years, for a long time, we Spanish democrats have felt a sense of isolation, of indifference and distance from Europe. We often felt it during Franco’s time and we have often felt it – I can assure you – during these years of fighting the fascism of ETA, of fighting for democracy and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the debt of indifference is being paid off and I feel proud to share this moment with you. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you as a Basque for this decision. I would like to thank you in my name but above all in the name of many ordinary anonymous people, who every day fight for freedom, who overcome fear in order to appear on the electoral lists, who overcome fear in order to write, and in the name of those people who cannot talk because ETA has silenced their voices for good.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of all of them, thank you very much and congratulations on this act today.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Watson has not theorised, but has taken account of what afflicts us and, in particular, he has dealt directly with what is inflicted on us by ETA, and of what affects Basque society, Spanish society and, in my case, Catalan society. His total condemnation and his call for the need to respect victims must be a constant element in our statements and our positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly and clearly like to highlight in this report the fact that important positive action measures are proposed for the legal and police areas: the establishment of minimum standards, the establishment of a form of extradition, the recognition of judicial resolutions, the execution of arrest warrants and the approximation of national legislations. I believe that these measures improve the important and priority legal and police action.</p>
<p class="contents">In the time that I have available, I believe I should stress that the report has not renounced important values in the fight against terrorism in Europe. It is very important that Recital N incorporates the idea that ideologies are legitimate if they are compatible with democratic respect and values.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that in Recital O, the expression ‘democratic dialogue’ reappears, as a fundamental principle, based on mutual respect and non-violence. It is also significant that Recitals R and S state that measures must have restrictions on the part of States so that there is no abuse of the legal regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all of this is important, given the balance which is provided by priority and efficiency of action and respect for European values. I must mention my satisfaction with these changes, because they change the resolution, approved by written declaration in September 1999 and in which I expressed my disagreement – even though I signed it – with the removal of the expression ‘democratic dialogue’.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this report the European Union is fully recovering its values on this issue, because peace, understood as the exclusion of violence, on the one hand, and dialogue, on the other, is an essential pairing for the European Union, inside and outside Europe. Europe, when it goes anywhere, inside or outside, does so with this pairing of ‘peace and democratic dialogue’ and clearly, as I insist inside and outside, I do not want to give any example because I would not want it to provoke comparisons which would alter what is positive about this report and this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very satisfied that this report can be approved and that it will be an effective tool for resolving this serious problem which affects many people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to examine now what is meant by terrorism, because it is recognised as something evil and is often used as an excuse to legitimise the infringement of fundamental rights by the state. And so I have considered the things that are designated as terrorism in this report. Trafficking in drugs is one example. As we all know, the line between illegal and legal drugs is drawn in a fairly arbitrary manner and cannot be inferred from the principles of health policy, for example. Many people here in Parliament, indeed, consume copious quantities of drugs. But I am well aware that the report refers to illegal drugs. I simply mean to say that drugs are an intrinsic feature of every society; they always have been, and no doubt they always will be. Criminalisation will not get us anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The report then deals with trafficking in human beings, for example. If the smuggling of human beings is meant – and these two concepts are frequently confused – it would be sufficient to include a reference to the fact that people who have had to enter the EU by illegal means have been recognised here as genuine asylum seekers. They are compelled to seek help from people like the snakeheads because we have created Fortress Europe here.</p>
<p class="contents">If traffic in human beings is meant, in other words the essential denial of people’s fundamental rights and the imposition of forced labour, this raises the question why the report on which we have just voted devotes so little attention to the protection of victims, of those who are traded. That would surely be the best way to go about eradicating abuses such as traffic in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, the report says that terrorism is also to be found in the context of illegal trafficking in drugs and arms. I have already said something on the subject of drugs; as for arms, I believe trafficking in arms is illegal but, what is far worse, it is immoral. Quite simply, the question is whether this immorality only applies to illegal arms trafficking. Does it not, in fact, extend to the legal arms trade? Is it not terrorism when civilians are attacked by NATO bombers and killed or made to suffer for the rest of their lives? There are people who resist, who take action, such as civil disobedience. They know very well that such action is illegal. Whether it is a crime is another matter. The report refers to corruption and fraud; many people are sick of government corruption and fraud and decide to do something about it, and we are supposed to construe that here as terrorism. If the House does not even accept the Greens’ amendment that seeks to establish fundamental human rights as a common minimum level of protection for everyone in the EU, the proposed recommendation must be rejected for the sake of those same fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We may have been deluding ourselves in thinking we had banished this scourge which had stained Europe with blood for so long. It may be that contemporary terrorism is more difficult to fight because it is less ideological and more sensationalist, because it is not based on political ideals but purely on violence, with precisely the aim of destabilising the institutions and terrorising the public.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, should be Parliament’s role? On the one hand, Parliament must certainly address the causes of that social and cultural malaise and distress which clearly lead to terrorism, but, most importantly, it must endeavour in some way to prevent the emergence of terrorist groups, to anticipate it and to identify the first signs as soon as they appear.</p>
<p class="contents">There are so many resources available to us: so many data banks, so many police resources and so much legislation, and yet, all too often, when faced with the emergence or transformation of large-scale criminal phenomena such as those related to drugs, crimes against children, the trafficking and exploitation of human beings and, of course, terrorism, Parliament continues to be taken by surprise and ends up arriving too late, incapable of defining effective preventive actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the case of those violent groups, many of them in contact with terrorist organisations, who infiltrated the peaceful, legitimate anti-globalisation movements. I therefore look forward to the measures envisaged in the report to contain the spread of terrorism, particularly the European search and arrest warrant and the abolition of the formal extradition procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Madam President, by saying that – to give just one example – there are still Italian citizens who used to be part of the Red Brigades and have been condemned as guilty of terrorist homicide for almost 20 years now, who have been in hiding for that entire period as the guests of other European States, despite repeated applications for their extradition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the report for the most part, although I do wonder – as we often ask ourselves – what exactly terrorism is. During the debate, we talked about the need to define the nature of terrorism today. In my view, the measure discussed in the report deals with European terrorism, not just that despicable method which – I regret to say – is developing in present-day Spain, for if we can call that method despicable then we must see the methods used in other European countries by movements with much more dubious aims as just as contemptible.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy has suffered a terrible period in which we witnessed the murder of activists in their offices, the murder of young people in the squares and children burned alive in their homes, in the name of an ideology which ultimately led to the murder of the government adviser, Mr D’Antona, and which often leads, in practice, as happened in this case, to the death of young people during demonstrations which result in blind violence which has nothing to do with opposition to the globalisation of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I look forward to a coordinated policy of all the European States which excludes the abominable special laws which proved to be genuine tools of political persecution when it was a case of striking one party and then tools of political protection when it was a case of protecting others, as Mrs Angelilli said just now. I look forward to the introduction of the European search and arrest warrant, but let it be genuinely established now. Let the governments be called upon to incorporate the measures into their legal systems and to ensure that, as of the next few months, we no longer witness events in our squares such as those which took place in Genoa a few days ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I may take the liberty to contest perhaps only one point, the threat of terrorism really has nothing to do with a democratic society – even though such societies are often the target of terrorist activity – but is a far more pervasive threat against all people, whatever the political conditions in which they live.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so difficult, and perhaps not even so important, to define the concept of terrorism more precisely. Maybe we should rather do as the report suggests and proceed from a definition of terrorist acts which focuses on the threat they pose to individuals and groups of people. Agreement at European level is the prerequisite for more effectively coordinated action, and the acceleration of extradition processes, which the report proposes, is certainly important too.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle enunciated in Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union, which calls terrorism a form of international crime, must be binding on all EU Member States, whose political representatives of particular ideological persuasions defend acts of violence inside or outside the EU as justifiable. I recall the discussions on the Middle East conflict, when some of our colleagues were suddenly able to sympathise with terrorist activities on one side or the other, although these were quite simply death squad operations and attacks on the civilian population.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the organisational requirement, namely cooperation between the responsible institutions, the political will to combat terrorist activities is also essential. There is never any justification for threatening an innocent person. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can state unreservedly, without any doubt – at least on my part – that the approval of this report would represent a European pact against terrorism. Because, for the people of Europe, violence and terror are absolutely incompatible with democracy, dialogue and the rules of the game which the democratic States have set ourselves in order to live together in peace and, in particular, in order to resolve absolutely every – and I stress, absolutely every – one of our problems and differences of whatever nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Nationalist or independence movements that use terrorist organisations such as ETA in Spain as decoys are only really hiding the reality of their trade whose only objective is to spread terror, destabilise democracy and indiscriminately murder children, young people and adults of any trade or profession.</p>
<p class="contents">Another argument endorsed by this report is the urgent need to update the legal instruments which a new area without borders, such as the European Union, must have so that it is not easier for the violent people and terrorist groups to carry out their criminal acts than it is for the police and judges to pursue and punish them. Because, Madam President, Commissioner, it is contradictory that there should be barriers and borders for judges and police while, for example, criminal groups organise themselves in one country of the European Union, carry out attacks in another and then return to shelter under legislation that is obsolete and incompatible with a common area of freedom, security and justice. Hence the need for the four recommendations, which are the backbone of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Spain and its government are particularly interested in what we resolve here today, but so should other countries such as France, Belgium, Italy or the United Kingdom or the other countries of the Union, because the roots of terrorism are in violence, its funding, the technological means it employs and the recruitment of young people who are trained, with money and hatred, to kill. And this is a problem, ladies and gentlemen, which transcends the borders of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, we are moving in the right direction. I must insist once again on the urgency of the proposals and the urgent need for us to continue truly creating a new area where there is only room and freedom of movement for those of us who want to live in peace and freedom.</p>

Most Member States have no anti-terrorist legislation, prison sentences vary from State to State and the tracking of criminals outside the territory in which a crime is committed is only possible – when it is at all possible – by means of the extradition mechanism, which is always subject to the limitations of the reciprocity and constitutionality of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism in Europe, consequently, slips through the net. Fortunately, the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Tampere Council and our own Commissioner António Vitorino have brought about changes in judicial cooperation in Europe. For this purpose, in this excellent report by Mr Watson, the European Parliament recommends that the Council lay down minimum rules for a definition of the constituent elements of the crime and its sanctions, replacing extradition with the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments, the definition of a European search and arrest warrant that does not allow criminals to laugh at the courts and the police, and standards for harmonisation in the field of compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in addition to these penal and legal matters, we must also ensure that intellectual prejudices and outdated historical opinions do not continue to portray terrorism in the heroic and romantic light of a fight for freedom. Freedom is guaranteed in constitutional States, which, today, all Member States of the European Community, fortunately, are. François Mitterand taught us that nationalism is war and we are today seeing, very close to us and right under our eyes, in the name of various cultures, languages, regionalisms and religions, murders, deaths and violence that Europe cannot tolerate. Europe must either trust in its values or become diluted in their opposites. Terrorism is the main weapon of madness and of ethnic, religious or cultural fanaticism. It is the opposite of freedom and of life. Let us rid Europe of it, with the full might and power of the law.</p>

It is a party which, while calling for an independent personality, sovereignty and a right to self-determination for the Basque people, nevertheless firmly rejects and condemns the use of violence and terror as instruments to achieve any political objective and, even more, condemns the unacceptable State terrorism, which we Basques have also suffered, perpetrated by the apparatus of the Spanish State.</p>
<p class="contents">Our society and Spanish society clearly have a special sensitivity in relation to the issues dealt with by Mr Watson in his complex report on the role of the EU in the fight against terrorism and, in general terms, we agree with the content of the report and also with the amendments presented by the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left and my own from the Greens/European Free Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Northern Ireland was lucky enough to enjoy the decisive support of US Senator Mitchell, which led to the Good Friday agreements and a genuine peace process, despite the ups and downs that it is suffering along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">How long will we Basques have to wait for Europe to realise that peace is in its hands, that it must stimulate, promote and oversee a sincere and democratic dialogue between the opposing sides?

<p class="contents">The aims of this package which Mr Watson has proposed, range from harmonisation of laws and regulations to improvement of judicial assistance, from the creation of a European search and arrest warrant to provision for the compensation of victims, and the Member States of the European Union should not only use it to combat the familiar forms of terrorism but should also apply it against the new forms of terror to which we were introduced at the last summit meeting and which I fear will resurface at similar events in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on these new forms of terrorism has left a lot to be desired. There has been no discussion about the safety of the innocent people who have been exposed to acts of violence, nor has there been any discussion about protecting property from destruction by violent activists and those who are incited to violence, about the police officers who have been seriously wounded or about either the compensation of victims or international police cooperation. Too little has also been said about the background, about the sources from which these terrorists draw their support and their funding and about the political orchestrators of terrorist activities. It has been a diluted discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">This terrorism that is threatening to sprout up again here, however, is increasingly international and global in character; its perpetrators are not truly engaged in the globalisation debate that needs to be pursued but are merely using the debate as a vehicle for acts of terror against governments, against state institutions – in short, against our democratic system. I therefore expect us to confront terrorism in both its old and new forms with the utmost vigour for the sake of the people, the security and the stability of our countries, to press our case uncompromisingly within the European Union, being ever mindful of those who have already fallen victim to this terrorism. I ask you all to give your overwhelming support to this excellently prepared package of measures, not only for the sake of Spain but also in the interests of Europe, its stability and the security of its people.</p>

It is a global phenomenon, with cells operating throughout the world. It can therefore only be effectively combated internationally. Fighting terrorism also means defending human rights and democracy. The cowardly terrorist attacks and murders we have seen recently, which have been at their most virulent in Spain, testify to the need to intensify European anti-terrorist cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">International terrorism, which draws support from many a dictator or Islamic fundamentalist regime, cannot be effectively combated in the European Union unless the competent national authorities cooperate with each other. Our House also bears responsibility in this respect; to exercise this responsibility, we must nail our colours to the mast by adopting this report on the role of the Union in combating terrorism and making it clear that we are unanimously committed to the fight against terrorist activity. I wish to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work towards this goal. Our proposals are intended to create the conditions for effective European cooperation among the Member States in order to put an end to the murders committed by terrorist organisations such as ETA in Spain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is powerless both because terrorism has changed shape and is now backed up by modern technology and funds and because there is little judicial and police collaboration on the part of the Member States and no common legislative framework.</p>
<p class="contents">In Greece, a new anti-terrorism law was passed in May 2001 in a bid to systemise and up the ante in the fight against terrorism without violating fundamental rights and the principles of the rule of law. However, combating terrorism, be it in Greece or Spain, is a matter for the European Union as a whole. The Charter of Fundamental Rights should be used as a reference point for any new initiative. In other words, under no circumstances should increased criminal activities by terrorist groups be used as an alibi, be it at national or European level, for taking measures which are incompatible with the rule of law and democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the case of terrorist offences, the Council should immediately abolish formal extradition procedures and adopt the principle of mutual recognition of decisions on criminal matters, including pre-judgment decisions, as proposed in the report. In addition to these measures, it also makes a great deal of sense to prevent terrorism through education, social and other policies to encourage citizens, especially young people, to value dialogue and reject all forms of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very balanced and very good report.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism has been a major problem in the Western world and in Europe it has been prevalent certainly since the Second World War. It has been proved that a dedicated few can hold a majority to ransom. We have to face up to the fact that there has not been full cooperation between Member States. We in Northern Ireland have experienced that very painfully over the past 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">If terrorists have a safe haven they will continue to flourish because they have somewhere to retreat to. We must end safe havens. I have some reservations, in that if you abolish extradition what you put in its place may not be effective. If we do abolish extradition, whatever replaces it must work and must be seen to work, especially between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must be free to protect their citizens. I believe it is the duty of every Member State government to protect the innocent, not the perpetrators of violence. There must be maximum cooperation to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">We also see terrorist cooperation throughout the world. The recent arrest of three IRA activists in Columbia brings home very clearly how widespread terrorism is throughout the world and how terrorists cooperate in the development of new and better weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to recognise that many terrorist organisations are involved in racketeering, drug smuggling and many other forms of normal criminal activity. They use certain words and pseudonyms. They threaten the communities in which they live.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise the victims. There must be mutual recognition. No one has the right to murder in the attempt to achieve a political objective. We must also remember it is easy to terrorise: I have experience of this. But believe you me, it is much more difficult to build peace after the terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore necessary – and this is what we have understood – the strengthen the fight against terrorism and create mechanisms and initiatives which strengthen cooperation between the Member States, bearing in mind, furthermore, the intensification of terrorist actions within the European Union. Also, the Member States must promote a commitment to rejecting any form of violence among their young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the four main recommendations in this report (the definition of the crime of terrorism and applicable penalties, removal of the formal extradition procedure, the application of the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments and the European search and arrest warrant), I wanted to specifically highlight the last one relating to compensation for the victims of terrorism which, perhaps, has been the one least mentioned by other Members. In this respect, I wish to highlight the fact that this House already adopted, on 24 November 2000, a report for which I had the honour of being rapporteur, which determined, for the first time, the definition of victims and their role in the judicial process.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to stress that, if we are capable of implementing the recommendations of this report, we will have taken a very significant step in developing the European area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the President of Parliament, Nicole Fontaine, for her personal attitude on opening this sitting in greeting the family of a victim of terrorism, the Councillor from the Union of the Navarrese People, José Javier Múgica, whose widow and three children were present in the Chamber and who have asked me to pass on their thanks to the whole House and to its President.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has managed to become a torchbearer in the European fight against terrorism. It was the first Chamber to produce a recommendation in writing that it was necessary to politically isolate political parties which do not condemn terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">And it has been this Parliament which has managed to gather more than 400 signatures of Members of this House in a public commitment to combat the terrorism of ETA.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now discussing the Watson report, and in this regard I would like to stress the need for the Union to have a European search and arrest warrant which replaces the formal extradition procedure for terrorist crimes as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Because terrorism, and specifically the terrorism of ETA, affects all the citizens of Europe, not only the victims, but even Members of this House. I regret that Mrs Dührkop is not present due to illness. She could have told us of how ETA deprived her of her husband, Senator Casas. My own wife and family have also been subject to three attacks, which cost the life of a policeman. And other Members could also speak of their suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain and other places in Europe suffer terrorism. We are not going to indulge in theorising, because we are aware that, as the Watson report proposes, we have to oblige the Member States to finally reach an agreement, because terrorism represents the greatest violation of human rights suffered by the European people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, as well as violent terrorism, it talks about a less explosive, very widespread terrorism operating under cover of political groupings whose objective is clearly to fight against democratic systems. Recitals E, F and G make this clear, stressing that terrorism is on the increase in almost all the European countries and that the nature of terrorism is changing radically, but that there are also, according to recital G, in particular, international networks enjoying strong – as the recital says – logistical and financial support. Well then, that is precisely what happened in Genoa during the G8 period. International terrorist organisations used the Black Blocks to exploit genuinely peaceful organisations, working under cover of groups purporting to be non-violent and their complicitous leaders, who were supported in turn by the parties of the Italian and European left, which even lent them the platform of the European Parliament yesterday to hurl frenzied abuse at the Italian government and against the values of democracy and respect for people’s ideals, values which Parliament supports and develops. This too, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is terrorism: it may be less potent but it is still effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital M and recommendation No 3 state this explicitly, and Amendment No 2, tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, is also negative evidence of this for, if it were to be adopted, this amendment would have Parliament believe that where the democratic and Constitutional structure of a country is working properly there is no terrorism. Well then, following this reasoning, we could cheerfully label Spain, Ireland and maybe even Italy as undemocratic countries with dysfunctional Constitutions, whereas their governments are the victims of terrorism, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and cannot be held accountable for it. This too is a form of terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is right to emphasise the need for effective, clear and rapid measures to prevent and combat all acts of terrorism whatever form they may take and whatever they may be trying to achieve. We reject and condemn all terrorist acts, which are unacceptable because of the blind violence that characterises them and which mainly affect innocent citizens. We know that terrorism is one of the most terrible challenges facing our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last ten years, the European Union has seen an increase in the number of violent and terrorist acts. This increase demonstrates that traditional methods of judicial and police cooperation are inadequate, particularly if we take account of the fact that new forms of terrorism are continually arising, such as computer or environmental terrorism. We also know that these acts increasingly stem from the activity of international organised networks, which manage to exploit the various legal loopholes and the diversity of national legislation. It is deplorable that most Member States do not have specific legislation in this field. Only six Member States, including Portugal, have specific legislation and out of these six, only four, again including Portugal, have adopted a definition of the concept of terrorism in their legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting the principle of solidarity in the fight against terrorism, the Treaty of Amsterdam has opened up new possibilities for coordinated action by the European Union. With the commitments given in Tampere, terrorism has become an integral part of the global approach to fighting crime. The report we are now debating warrants our support, particularly because it advocates the approximation and harmonisation of the legislation of the fifteen Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am only going to make two points. One of them is addressed to those Members who have said that what we are voting on today, this arrest warrant, replaces extradition; that is not the case at all; it accompanies extradition for certain crimes which are particularly odious, such as a terrorist crime, precisely so that the European Union may become more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">And I am going to make my second point, Mr President. I believe that if we look back to 1992 when this Parliament voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, we will see that there were considerable gaps in the issues of justice and internal affairs within the third pillar. It was a great innovation that the European Union was going to deal with issues which had always been at the heart of the Member States. Very little time has passed since then, practically seven years, since Maastricht entered into force, and nevertheless, what progress has been made! Progress has not just been made in terms of European solidarity on a specific problem, the terrorism of ETA, which is extraordinarily important and which is of fundamental importance politically; but progress has also been made in the construction of Europe. This is the way to move forward together in Europe and to deal with the real concerns of the citizens, as has been said here.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as well as expressing gratitude for European solidarity, I would like to say that this Watson report – and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has made great efforts – also represents a very important milestone on this journey which we, including all of us here in this European Parliament, are making together in the construction of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, underpinning the European Union and its Member States is the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the guarantee of human dignity and the protection of individuals and institutions enshrined in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these rights can be breached by acts of terrorism. In a completely democratic setting, such as we have in the Union and in its Member States, terrorist acts can never be justified, irrespective of where they are carried out or their aim. Acts of terrorism must never be considered to be political crimes or as crimes connected with, or inspired by, political motives. Terrorism must never be considered to be a way of solving a problem facing an individual or a group, regardless of its nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, Europe has seen an increase in terrorist activity within its borders, characterised by a profound change in the nature of the acts carried out. The actual or potential impact of armed attacks has become increasingly destructive and lethal as a consequence of technological changes taking place in the arms and explosives sector. New forms of terrorism are emerging as a result of the on-going and rapid development of information technologies, electronic databases and computer equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorists are able to exploit differences between the legal systems of various Member States and the difficulties in extraditing such people, especially when such an act is not covered by law in a given State. This aspect illustrates, as has been said several times during the debate, the inadequacy of traditional forms of judicial and police cooperation in combating terrorism. There is, therefore, a greater need today than ever before to adopt measures to fight terrorism by drafting legislative proposals designed to punish such acts.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions of the European Union, in particular the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, have continually condemned terrorism at a political level. Unfortunately, we have been called upon unusually frequently to state this position as a result of the terrorist actions of ETA in Spain. Our solidarity with the Spanish people and especially with the victims of terrorism in Spain is unequivocal and unceasing. We must build on this solidarity with more effective actions. This is why Article 29 of the Treaty of Amsterdam refers specifically to common action in three areas: closer cooperation between police forces, customs agencies and other competent authorities, including Europol, closer cooperation between Member States’ judicial authorities and approximation, where necessary, of criminal law provisions. Under Article 2 of the Europol Convention, terrorism falls within the competence of Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to Article 31(b) of the Treaty establishing the European Union and the Tampere conclusions, which states that formal extradition procedures between Member States will be abolished for individuals trying to escape justice, to be replaced by a simple transfer, the Commission has already announced its intention to present an initiative designed to abolish formal extradition procedures between Member States for certain types of crime and to create a ‘European search and arrest warrant’. The purpose is to combat not only terrorism but also other heinous transnational crimes. Similarly, the Commission intends to propose an approximation of criminal legislation on acts of terrorism, pursuant to Article 31(e) of the Treaty establishing European Union, not only covering traditional forms of terrorism, but also its newer incarnations. Lastly, the act of directing, promoting, supporting or belonging to a terrorist organisation must also be subject to a common standard. The Commission shares Parliament’s concerns with regard to protecting the victims of terrorism and intends to present, in the course of the current presidency, a Green Paper on compensating victims of crime in general and of terrorist crime in particular within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, the Commission agrees with the principles set out in the excellent report by Mr Watson, whom I wish to warmly congratulate, and with the guidelines contained in the draft recommendation that Parliament is considering today. Following the work that we have been carrying out over the last few months, in close consultation with all Member States – and I must emphasise, with all Member States and not just with some – the Commission intends to propose to Parliament and to Council, in September, legislative initiatives on harmonising the definition of terrorism, on adopting the European search and arrest warrant and on replacing extradition procedures with rapid handover mechanisms for certain types of crime, including terrorism, thereby, I am sure, fully complying with the requests made in your draft recommendation.</p>
