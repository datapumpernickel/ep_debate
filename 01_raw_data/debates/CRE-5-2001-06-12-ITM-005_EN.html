<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Davies (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, a friend who used to work for a leading wildlife conservation NGO tells me that it was a depressing experience each morning to read her e-mails detailing the loss of habitats and new threats to the survival of species across the world. I can understand that. So it is a pleasure to acknowledge that not every environmental problem is beyond resolution and that, in some instances as least, we are capable of turning the tide. Such is the case with air pollution. The evidence is that now, at least in some cities and towns across Europe, the air we breathe is perhaps purer than at any time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Problems remain. It is claimed that air pollution still contributes to more premature deaths than traffic accidents, but progress is being made.</p>
<p class="contents">Ground-level ozone is a pollutant which still severely affects the health of many of our citizens. It contributes to problems of asthma in children – now said to affect as many as one in ten children in the United Kingdom alone – and to breathing difficulties in the elderly. In severe circumstances people die. Government studies in my country suggest that ozone may lead to the premature death of 12 500 people each year. We are all well aware of the problems experienced in some cities in Europe, such as Athens, where the problem is intensified by particular climatic conditions. Pollution has further economic consequences, by reducing crop yields and damaging trees.</p>
<p class="contents">European legislation plays an increasing role in setting tighter standards and curbing pollution. Nothing better illustrates this than the need for concerted action on ozone. It is created by a chemical reaction between sunlight and oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds derived mostly from vehicle emissions and petrol distribution. It is often formed miles from the source of the problem. So it is a classic trans-boundary pollutant requiring trans-boundary action at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The national emissions ceiling directive will provide the framework for reductions in key air pollutants. This directive concerns the action which Member States should take locally to deal with the particular problem of ozone. At first reading I welcomed the Commission's proposals to set a target value encouraging Member States not to permit ozone to exceed the World Health Organisation's guidelines of more than 20 days a year; to alert the public if local health risks are high; and to compare the performance of different countries. But I argued that the proposals were not demanding enough. Parliament has made a number of changes and, of the 19 amendments we agreed on, the Council has accepted ten of the minor ones in full and another four in part. The Council has also decided that it wants the target for the maximum number of exceedances to be 25 rather than 20 days. This does not sound too bad a compromise. Perhaps I am just a bit cynical in suggesting that it is too easy for ministers to agree tough targets which are not legally binding. Parliament should be taking steps now to ensure that the final shape of the legislation places firm obligations on Member States to achieve the objectives they claim they want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I want Member States to be required to meet the target, save where it is physically impossible for them to do so. I want them to work towards a date by which the long-term objective of never having ozone levels exceeding WHO guidelines will be achieved. I want them quickly to implement short-term action plans if ozone levels exceed double the WHO recommendations, and I want them to provide the Commission with information of a standard which enables comparison to be made between the performance of different Member States, so that the public can determine which countries are making a real effort and which are not.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying this, I recognise the need to take into account the fact that one country may not be responsible for the pollution which affects it. I also understand that meteorological conditions vary. The north west of England, for example, may generate more traffic fumes than many places elsewhere in Europe but, because we are not blessed with too much sunlight, ozone is less of a problem to us than it may be in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish, in particular, to place too onerous a burden upon Mediterranean countries. But Parliament needs to adopt a strong position now, in order that the final agreement we reach with the Council reflects the need for Member States to take some real action.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank colleagues in other parties for working with me to try and ensure that Parliament's position commands a large majority. I thank Parliament's staff and, in particular, my assistant, Vikki Phillips, who has made a very considerable contribution to this process over the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an opportunity to make a contribution to the process of reducing pollution and cleaning the air we breathe. I hope Parliament will give its support to the proposals in this report and the compromises agreed between the political parties, and that we play our part in achieving what could be another success story for the European environment.</p>

<p class="contents">Concentrations of ozone are very unevenly distributed amongst the Member States. And, owing to their cross-border nature, they affect places which are often far from their source of production.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the Member States have neither studied nor dealt with this phenomenon sufficiently, neither have they assessed it in a systematic and coordinated way. The result has been an absence of reliable and comparable data, as well as insufficiency in short- and long-term action plans. It is therefore very necessary that we adopt the present Directive and I take a very positive view of Mr Davies’s work, especially his approach to the problem, since he stresses the aspects of study and control and is prepared to incorporate the suggestions of other groups, which means the House is able to vote on a proposal with significant compromise amendments, which enrich the Commission’s proposal and maintain the sense of reality and viability of the measures proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The first important result of this Directive is that it is finally going to persuade Member States to pay more attention to the problem of tropospheric ozone, strengthening its study and control; secondly, it makes it obligatory to create short- and long-term action plans and improve rapid alert systems and public information. In this respect, its seems to me important that these plans strengthen, in each case, the study of the local conditions in which the concentrations are produced, in order thereby to combat them more effectively. I also believe it is necessary to set target dates in order to stimulate progress on the control of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the current difficulties in guaranteeing the complete control of the concentrations of tropospheric ozone and strict compliance at all times with the values and timescales laid down. Our Group has therefore insisted on the need to seek formulae which, while strengthening the Member States’ obligations, set realistic objectives and timescales, which allow a certain flexibility in those cases where its has been physically impossible to reach the objectives and which take account, in the comparative reports, of the meteorological and local circumstances of the places where the target values have been exceeded. We have logically opposed the amendments which do not take account of the scientific possibilities of controlling the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with Mrs Myller’s report on national emissions ceilings, which is before the Conciliation Committee at the moment, this report will make an important contribution to securing better air quality, especially in the big cities of Europe. It will be an important contribution to preventing and reducing ozone’s harmful effects on the environment and public health. I should like to point out the most important features of Mr Davies's report. First and foremost, it is important that we stick to the WHO's health targets in this area and that those exceedances of these targets that are to be accepted for a number of years are limited as far as possible, in this case to 20 days per year. By means of the report, we shall thus also reject the Council’s wish to be given the option of longer exceedance periods.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would draw your attention to the long-term targets for the concentration of ozone in the air. We now have a deadline for when the long-term targets are to be achieved, namely before 2020, except in cases where it is physically impossible to achieve the targets. It will be an important task for both the Commission and Parliament to ensure that the compromise made here concerning what is physically impossible does not in reality become a pretext for doing nothing and to ensure that there is not too much elasticity in the compromise. I would also point out how important it is for information to be given both to the general population and, in particular, to the especially vulnerable population groups too, namely children and the elderly. The report requires that information be provided and that action plans be devised so that rapid intervention is possible if the concentration of ozone is too high.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, finally, also to indicate two other areas included by Mr Davies. The first is the relationship with the applicant countries. I think it is right that we should try to involve the applicant countries as early as possible in this process, as recommended also by those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Ozone pollution is, of course, clearly transboundary in character, a fact which justifies our including as many neighbouring countries as we possibly can from the beginning. Finally, the reporting, which Mr Davies also emphasised in his speech here today, is important if we are to have comparisons not only of initiatives taken in the Member States but also of exceedances which, as a matter of actual fact, occur in the Member States. I believe that, with the adoption of this report, we shall be taking a considerable step forward and acquiring a sound basis for the further negotiations with the Commission and the Council in the Conciliation Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group is able to support all the amendments. We should also like to thank Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo for supporting the compromise amendments. The Council of Environment Ministers only wishes to provide an interim solution to the problem of summer smog by 2010. It refuses to go any further. We do want to go further. My group and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy propose to consign summer smog to the past by 2020. That can be done by completely eliminating the polluting substance NOx, firstly by introducing the second generation of catalytic converters, which will be compulsory in new cars in 2005 and in new lorries in 2007, then by introducing fuel cells for buildings, homes and vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the Commission once again where the proposal is for a directive on volatile organic substances for paints. After all, the level of volatile organic substances has to come down as well in order to eliminate summer smog altogether. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Rules of Procedure state that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is responsible for competition matters. The proposal in question, concerning services of public interest, was even presented by Mario Monti, the Commissioner responsible for competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mr Langen, who has been working on this matter for several months and has now submitted a report, has just discovered to his astonishment that another committee is responsible. I wish to say quite clearly here that a group of three Vice-Presidents has no authority to overturn the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I ask that we proceed in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and that the Conference of Presidents deal with this matter. Unfortunately, it is not the only current issue concerning the competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is apparently being widened bit by bit. This question must be settled once and for all, and the Conference of Presidents is the body to settle it, for the present situation is obstructing the proper discharge of our parliamentary duties.</p>

However, according to my current information, which I will verify, the committee on conflict of competences – which is the body you are referring to, made up of three Vice-Presidents – adopted a proposed decision which was ratified by the Conference of Presidents of Political Groups in its meeting last Thursday. This is the procedure contained in our Rules of Procedure. Without getting into the argument of whether or not this proposed decision is the most desirable one, it is the one which has allowed us to resolve it in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. But we will verify whether the information I have been given is up to date.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
