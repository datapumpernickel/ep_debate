<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Camisón Asensio (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is well known that, despite successive reforms, Article 73 of the Treaties remains in force, which means that coordination between the various modes of transport is still a Community obligation. It should not be otherwise, since if this were not the case what would probably happen, given the current trends that we face every day, is that the roads would fill to bursting point with lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">Such coordination between the various transport modes was taking place under a Regulation that had been in force for thirty years and was beginning to seize up. This gave the Commission an excellent opportunity to put forward this proposal, which will replace the old regulation just in time. This is its intention and we applaud it.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, however, that the Commission has displayed a certain degree of prudence in its proposal. It has moved ahead, but rather too tentatively. What is more, everything indicates that most of the political groups in this House are of the same opinion, since this is revealed by the content and the large number of amendments – 116 – tabled and debated in this Parliament’s Committee on Transport, almost all of them with the same message: to use this opportunity to encourage the necessary and appropriate transfer of traffic onto more environmentally friendly modes of transport. This is a desirable objective which, I believe, has to a great extent been achieved, in view of the results of the exhaustive voting that took place in the Committee. Therefore, as the rapporteur, I must congratulate the Members who tabled those amendments, since the results achieved – which today are put before this House as a joint effort by everybody – are the outcome of a broad consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to draw the Commission’s attention to this fact when it accepts or rejects our amendments. We would like there to be a reasonable degree of identification between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In our debates we bore in mind facts such as the following: a vital Kyoto commitment is to cut our polluting gas emissions by 8% by 2010, whereas, if there is no change in the relative shares of the various transport modes, it has been predicted that in the transport sector there will be a 40% increase in these emissions over this period. It has also been calculated that moving goods by rail needs four times less energy than by road. Something similar could be said for transport by inland waterway. Trains can use a greater proportion of renewable energy. If action is not taken in time, road traffic will double between now and 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Does all this mean that we have to gradually give up using roads? Not at all. There may be some conflict of opposing interests between the different transport modes – that is to be expected – but the strikingly obvious consequence of all this is that coordination between the various transport modes is still essential.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely the aim of the proposal we are debating today, and through it the respective shares of each transport mode may tend to be redistributed in more rational proportions. In view of this intermodal conflict it must be recognised that the Commission has acted in a reasonably balanced manner in its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, without ever losing sight of that coveted balance, we have moved ahead but only ever opening the throttle in what I would call emergencies, that is, in those objectives that should not wait any longer. For instance, accepting that in practice transhipment between land and maritime transport, and also coastal traffic, has a significant land component and therefore should not be ignored in this directive. Emphasising real, sustained progress, and also research and development. Enhancing combined transport, the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> concept for avoiding bureaucracy, and the contractual relationship for ensuring the transfer of traffic from one mode to another that is more beneficial.</p>
<p class="contents">To end with, what can be said about external costs? It is a fact that there are highly competent consultants who have argued, for instance, that external costs, including traffic congestion, are shooting up to account for 10% of the gross domestic product of Europe, a figure which may be debatable but which is astounding all the same.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this we believe that the Commission should tackle this problem now. We urge the Commission to prepare a proposal taking into account the value of such external costs so that they can then be internalised, and then we will have taken a giant step forwards in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has assessed the Commission proposal in terms of competitive aspects and competitive neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">The point of departure is that a shift towards more sustainable transport should, first of all, occur by providing an honest account of the cost per mode of transport. However, the external effects and specific infrastructural costs are not yet included in the price for the consumer. That is why the Member States must be able to offer compensation to the competing modes of transport. This opportunity, in the shape of compensation, is offered in the present proposal for a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In its recommendation, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has made a strong case for honest competition. For this purpose, it has asked for the definitions of specific infrastructural costs and external effects to be worded more accurately. Additionally, the description of the term “common interest” deserves attention. After all, the Commission will grant support insofar as it does not contravene the common interest. Clear definitions should prevent ambiguity in the interpretation and, consequently, should secure honest competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains the economically sensitive subject of support which goes beyond compensation for effects which have not yet been included. Competitive neutrality can therefore be jeopardised. In order to establish a level playing field for the different modes of transport, and for companies, in particular, transparency is crucial in this case. The draftsman of the opinion would have liked to have seen more weight accorded to this in the draft report, because this draft report calls for active support which goes beyond compensation. In this connection, simply granting terminals for combined transport exemption from notification is not a reasonable measure to take.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation may seem difficult to understand at first, but it applies honest competition as the appropriate tool for achieving sustainable transport. More precise definitions contribute to the clarity of the Commission’s position with regard to equal conditions and transparency. This adds the necessary predictability in the assessment of support schemes by the Commission. After all, indeterminate support and inequality among businesses should not form barriers to sustainable transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has drafted it very carefully. He did not succumb to the temptation to open the door to subsidies still wider; on the contrary, he kept it where the vice-president suggested. The vice-president and Mr Camisón Asensio were streets ahead of the European Council. We may, nonetheless, quote the European Council. The European Council stated in Stockholm that we need to reduce the scope of state aid in the European Union and to make the aid system more transparent. And that is precisely the objective here. I think that, in replacing the old Regulation No 1107/70 with the new regulation, we have indeed made the system more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the use to which it is put, I believe that aid only compensates so-called unpaid costs in connection with the development and use of transport infrastructures. This poses a problem, because it is not clear exactly what external costs are. Let me give you an example: the theory that it is always better, for the purpose of environmental protection, to shift freight from the road to the railway does not automatically apply. We are debating noise in the vicinity of airports, we are in the process of banning night flights. Just think about when you hear a good old freight train in the middle of the night; it is loud, it stinks and the brakes squeal.</p>
<p class="contents">What I mean is that, when it comes to questions such as "What are external costs? How can they be scientifically defined? And how can they be apportioned?", we still have our work cut out. I am delighted that the report says as much. It is work which the Commission has yet to do and I am keeping my fingers crossed that the Commissioner will be able to do it soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stockmann (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my Group. He was most cooperative while drafting his report. Basically, the rule of the internal market is that aid distorts competition and is therefore inadmissible. The previous speaker pointed this out. There must be special grounds for exceptions to this rule. In this regulation, the special grounds are: the coordination of inland transport. The prime purpose of aid in this sector is to allow fair competition between road, rail and inland waterway transport. This is the only way of optimising the overall European transport system in the long term, especially in the freight sector. This is the only way we shall ever bring about the much-vaunted intermodal transport chains. In order to make these transport chains as flexible as possible, we want to extend the scope of the regulation to short sea shipping. Government funding for building, maintaining and operating transport infrastructure does not come under the ban on aid, provided that it is available to all users on a non-discriminatory basis. This should apply irrespective of the legal form of the infrastructure operator. This is the only way of ensuring that railways and ports are treated on a equal footing with roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to aid for use of the infrastructure. Aid for using transport infrastructure should reflect the widely varied costs incurred by society from the choice of mode of transport. In other words, both the infrastructure and the external costs must be included when calculating aid. Equality of competition between the modes of transport is safeguarded by paying the difference between the unpaid costs of two carriers to the social and more environmentally-friendly carrier in the form of aid in order to make it cheaper and more attractive to use. Unfortunately – and this has also already been addressed – there is no politically legitimate model for calculating these costs at European level, which is why I have agreed, after a great deal of discussion and careful thought, to the supplementary model, which provides for contracts to shift transport from the roads to the railways and inland waterways. This is introduced in proposed Amendment No 48 and I call on the House to support it. However, this model should only be allowed for a transitional period because, the best intentions notwithstanding, it contradicts the basic approach of the regulation in targeting equality of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to notification: aid needs to be notified, but bureaucratic costs should be kept to a minimum. We therefore suggest exemptions for terminals which are provided for in a national or European development plan or which belong to the trans-European freight traffic network. We are also in favour of a <span class="italic">de minimis </span>rule of EUR 100 000 over three years.

It is precisely because we think we should push forward with and put pressure on the processes of the liberalisation of the markets and transport services that we feel that there is room for the States to retain, in a limited number of cases, their right and duty to intervene to ensure that urban development objectives are pursued and that social and environmental requirements are met.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst these matters, there is no doubt that the incentive for sustainable mobility is an historic objective that must be pursued now; from this standpoint, therefore, the aid for use of infrastructure by companies, which is intended to compensate for incremental unpaid infrastructure and external costs of competing modes of transport, must also be accepted. We are forced to this point because the forecast contained in Article 4 of the regulation is dictated solely by the absence of a general Community legislation on the definition, assessment and charging of the costs of using the infrastructure, whether they are internal or external. This is a subject upon which Parliament has already expressed its opinion in a report which I had the honour to present on its behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, just until the Commission produces its proposal – and I am less sceptical on this point than Mr Jarzembowski because I hope, or rather, I am sure, that the Commission will succeed in producing measures and technical forms that will resolve many of the theoretical problems which are still being raised – I feel that the possibility laid down in Amendments Nos 26, 40 and 48 of an explicit link between State aid and objectives of the effective transfer of freight volumes towards more sustainable modes of transport must be supported. In conclusion, I feel that the "contract" which we envisage establishing temporarily with those who genuinely undertake to uphold sustainable mobility is something which can be employed until more general rules are introduced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Exceptions to aid rules are important, in fact they are absolutely indispensable because, first, additional assistance is needed in order to develop, operate, maintain and/or complete transport infrastructures and, secondly, freight sent by rail, internal waterway or combined transport should receive compensation for the unpaid costs of competing road transport, so that specific requirements, such as environmental friendliness and regional potential, can be incorporated into transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">An approach which only aims to prevent potential distortions of competition and fails to include environmental, social or regional aspects is unacceptable. The rapporteur, who deserves our thanks for his excellent work, and the Committee have set more far-reaching, important premises, which my group supports, such as including aid for short sea shipping, including combined transport operations at sea ports, granting aid irrespective of whether the company is a public or private company, minimising administrative costs by introducing thresholds below which no checking by or notification to the Commission is required, extending the period of aid and providing the possibility of extending the aid regulation. Once this regulation has been implemented, there will be further opportunity to shift more traffic to more environmentally-friendly carriers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The numerous proposed amendments are proof of the interest which this report has generated. An aid regulation for transport infrastructure and use is important, because it will increase transparency. And apart from this, we may expect this directive to improve efficiency and bring about environmentally-friendly and safe transport, even if only one small step at a time. Although no one particular type of transport is given special attention in this directive, we expect traffic on the roads to be relieved. But this will not happen if there is false competition between the various modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, this regulation shifts the emphasis, with the Committee making provision for various amendments which go in two directions. First – as Mr Jarzembowski has already explained – we think it is important to provide a more accurate definition of the concept of external costs. They cannot be interpreted differently from one country to another or from one region to another, because that really will cause distortion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also assume that distortions of competition will be avoided by treating carriers identically. If a state invests in transport infrastructure which is to be equally accessible to all users, then no distinction should be made between these carriers. Irrespective of whether this aid is intended for the railways, the roads or an inland port, the aid must be measured against the criterion of accessibility of the infrastructure to users, so as to guarantee fair competition. Then we also fail to see – and some proposed amendments also relate to this – why, according to this philosophy, multimodal platforms or inland ports should be burdened with a <span class="italic">de facto</span> notification requirement. We expect simpler administrative procedures and, hence, equal treatment of all carriers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is one point with which I, like other members of the Dutch People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, am struggling, namely the following.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital No 14 and Article 4 provide for the possibility of government aid being granted for the purpose of the use of infrastructure. This is possible pursuant to the amendments. In our opinion, this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable. First of all because the starting premise is wrong, for transport by road already pays the lion’s share of external costs. Secondly, it is not judicious to grant extra support for the use of the railways, because costs do not constitute the most important reason why transporters do not opt for rail. We need an increase in quality and reliability, and market discipline is in that case the best incentive. I fear that this incentive for a modal shift, of which we are, of course, in favour, is counterproductive, brings about distortion of competition and undermines the work that has been done in the framework of the rail infrastructure package. We will therefore be voting against Recital No 14 and Article 4. They do not belong here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a result, rail companies, which pocket the receipts from the lines conceded to them without bothering to lay out the minimum expenditure to maintain and renew tracks and other rail equipment, have not only been given absolution but will be entitled to additional subsidies to meet investment obligations which should be their responsibility.</p>

And the detailed work produced by our rapporteur on this proposal is also good, including what the Committee has added in a whole series of proposed amendments, including short sea shipping, including combined transport procedures, disregarding whether the carrier is a public or private company, not to mention a <span class="italic">de minimis </span>rule intended to keep excessive administrative costs within prescribed limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Regretfully, we must also point out what this regulation cannot achieve. Mr Camisón Asensio himself has addressed this. We still have to live with transport policy specifications from the last century, admittedly from the middle and the second half of the 20th century, but hardly forward-looking models for the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to stem the tide of traffic on the roads in the future, we must do more than change a few aid rules for the benefit of the railways and shipping. And if we do more, then we should do it consistently. The Commission has just submitted a proposal to abolish – without replacing – the quantitative ceiling of 108% in the agreement on transit traffic through Austria. Whether this is in keeping with the spirit of the Camisón Asensio report I somehow doubt. The forthcoming discussion on this new proposal will give us an opportunity to clarify this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal for a Regulation concerning state aid for the inland transport sector implements Article 73 of the Treaty, according to which aids for the coordination of transport are compatible with Community law. Our intention, therefore, is to create a transparent, coherent and clear framework so that there will not be distortions in the market. It is also important that the same standards should be applied to different inland transport modes that compete with one another. The Commission proposal, therefore, establishes common criteria for the granting of exemptions which apply equally to all types of inland transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Roughly half of the amendments agree with the Commission’s position and can therefore be accepted. Some of them, however, run in a very different direction and hence we cannot accept them. I shall refer to some of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the concept of state aid is the cornerstone of the Union’s competition policy. According to this concept, any public aid to a company performing an economic activity, whatever its legal status, is an example of state aid to which the rules of the Treaty apply. Neither Amendment Nos 21 or 37 can change this fundamental principle of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of several amendments is to encourage rail and combined transport through the granting of public subsidies in detriment to other transport modes. We cannot share the approaches proposed, although we agree with the concern and need to boost the railways. But, ladies and gentlemen, we shall achieve this if the railways are able to give good quality service and are thus competitive, and to this end I believe the measures we are setting in motion are the best.</p>
<p class="contents">A key element of the proposal is to create conditions of equality, so that there can be fair competition between companies based on the user-pays principal, which takes into account external and infrastructure costs. As a consequence, state aid should confine itself to compensating for certain external costs, all within a framework of fair competition. Uncontrolled aid in excess of these costs does not give these companies adequate incentive to improve efficiency and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments propose that aid to transhipment installations, with combined transport terminals, should be exempt from any notification procedure, but since the terminals are often operated by private companies and compete with other terminals to attract traffic flows, there is an obvious risk that there may be a distortion of competition. We therefore cannot accept that they should not be communicated.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been proposed that companies that provide passenger transport services may opt for aid to compensate for external and infrastructure costs. Aid for passenger services, however, under Article 73, is regulated in the Commission regulation on public services, which proposes a complete and appropriate framework on the manner in which the public authorities can support the provision of internal passenger transport services. Therefore the aim of these amendments is ultimately to change this regulation, and the Commission cannot therefore accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">One amendment also asks for criteria to be established regarding systems for compensating for external effects and infrastructure costs. The assessment of external effects is a subject under constant debate, as Mr Jarzembowski has indicated. Today there are methods applicable to that kind of assessment, but despite the Commission’s efforts the Member States have proved very resistant to agreeing on common formulae.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is by no means giving up the idea of submitting a proposal of this kind in the future, and I should again like to thank Mr Costa for the work he put into his own report on this. But what we can never do is subordinate the need to assess concrete plans for public aid to an agreement by the European institutions on common standards. On the basis of a pragmatic approach and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, and until we have these standards accepted jointly by everyone, the Commission leaves the choice of the method for assessing these costs in each specific case to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all these arguments, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 18 (second part), 19, 20, 24, 27, 33, 36, 40, 44, 45 and 51.
