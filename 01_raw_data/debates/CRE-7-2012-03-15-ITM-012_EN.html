Nevertheless it is worth noting that in recent times the European Union has displayed a tendency to impose highly restrictive ecological solutions on itself even though the world’s greatest polluters, such economies as India and China, do not share EU objectives. One can also not ignore the fact that within the European Union itself, the highest price imposed by these – I emphasise – lofty ideals, which are being adopted by our organisation, the highest price is to be paid by the relatively poorly developed economies. For this reason, while agreeing with everything that underlies our document, I was unable to vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all it is essential to have a clear idea of the costs of raising reduction targets. Secondly, the proposal to reduce the number of permits introduces uncertainty into the business sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The document states that industry needs clear signals in order to make investments, but the same document proposes a change to agreements made just two to three years ago concerning the number of CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emission permits. It was on the basis of those agreements that companies planned their investments for the period to 2020. Can such a measure be called regulatory certainty and does it provide a clear picture of the European low-emissions strategy? Not all Union agreements from 2008 have come into force and we do not yet know the effects of the package agreed, so I think that it is premature to be setting new targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. For this reason I voted against this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The second step might be to label the shops and the third to visibly label the clothing of all citizens from Central and Eastern Europe. We should not be satisfied just with today’s motion for a resolution. We must keep up our pressure until Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has condemned these shameful sites and taken legal steps to close them down. In my opinion, they are discriminatory and contrary to the freedoms of the Union. They also incite hatred and divide European society. It is wrong of the Dutch Government and media not to confront xenophobic tendencies with clear arguments. For 20 years, the Dutch have profited from post-communist Eastern Europe, investing EUR 23 billion in Poland alone. Hundreds of Dutch people have built second homes in the Czech Republic. Now, thanks to the EU, hundreds of thousands of labourers and other workers are helping the further development of the Dutch economy directly in the Netherlands. We expect that the majority of Dutch society is unequivocally opposed to the xenophobic tendencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not true to say that the elections were illegal and it is greatly misleading for those MEPs who were not there. Secondly, I am convinced that the European Parliament does not have the moral right to teach others when it has even worse human rights violations and even crimes in its own Union, when people are handcuffed, thrown into a cell, held under house arrest during elections, prevented from meeting voters, and when illegal searches are carried out, funds seized, parties’ activities blocked and people are slandered on state television. The worst thing is that the European Parliament is failing to draw attention to and is even concealing crimes perpetrated by European Union Member States against opponents. Cases are falsified and the opposition is being drawn into legal trials; year after year people are being hauled before the courts. A mechanism has been created that only allows you to prove your case after 10-15 years, once your political career is already over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The basic problem of Russia today is an ever more obvious lack of political pluralism together with restrictions on media freedom. The results of the current presidential elections cannot be considered to be representative, if one takes just the example of the exclusion of candidates that wished to stand for election. The irregularities in the election process, particularly the reports of breaches of electoral law, also require thorough investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">The increased involvement of Russian society was however a considerable achievement of the last election campaign; its involvement and clear ambition to decide on the nation’s future must translate into a change in the way Vladimir Putin’s regime governs the country. I would therefore support the appeal by the Russian authorities to start a substantive dialogue with pro-democracy demonstrators and the opposition and to reduce restrictions and tone down rhetoric. A simplification in the rules for registering political parties, freedom for them to act as well as guarantees of civil liberties, these are all measures that Brussels should make a pre-condition for continued cooperation with Russia. For this reason I support this motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Putin should realise that Russia in this decade is no longer the same country in which he came to power 12 years ago.

Logically some colleagues have suggested that this resolution should also include a proposal that Russia should not only amend certain laws, but also hold early elections to the State Duma soon.

That is not the case at present, of course, and if we examine the situation closely, with reference to European values and our concepts of justice, neither the Russian Parliament nor the President have been legally elected, and this, of course, poses a problem.

So far, Kazakhstan has been a country that has been able to escape the national and regional conflicts that are common in that part of the world. We should certainly give appreciation for the religious and racial tolerance that exists in Kazakhstan. It is with all the more concern therefore that we observed the events that took place in that country in December of last year – demonstrators being killed, events that aroused concern in Kazakhstan and throughout the world. It is therefore all the more satisfying to hear that the Kazakh authorities, according to reports that have reached us, have taken a hard line as regards dealing with those responsible for these events. From our side, that of the European Parliament, an organisation that is supportive of Kazakh nationalities, there should come a clear message: democracy should apply everywhere, no one is above the law and therefore those responsible for these events should be brought to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday there was a very thorough and serious debate in this chamber over what we have seen taking place in Kazakhstan. The events of last December are naturally the type of events that cannot in any circumstances be approved of, and all those who were responsible for those events and those who are guilty of the killings must be brought to justice. If Kazakhstan has taken steps to that end, then that it is truly commendable. On the other hand, Kazakhstan is definitely a very important state, large and powerful due to its resources. It is certainly also in the interest of the European Union to cooperate with Kazakhstan, but the precondition for that cooperation is that Kazakhstan should move towards democracy and democratic values.</p>

We need to recognise that there have been widespread attacks against Christians and Christian communities in Muslim countries, for example against the Copts in Egypt. The problem has been exacerbated since the so-called Arab Spring. The same is true in Syria, where the rebels also lead attacks on Christians, and in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Since Iraq’s so-called liberation, Iraqi Christians have shrunk to a very small minority. I myself know a number of Iraqi refugees in Austria. When the Danish Minister spoke yesterday on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, saying that this should not be allowed to become a religious conflict, he displayed a great deal of naivety. This is already a religious conflict and, as a religious conflict, it threatens our Christian brothers in these countries, which is why we need to do much more for these Christian communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it was important that the Commissioner should have announced the Commission’s intention to impose sanctions on countries that dragged their heels in implementing the Water Framework Directive. This should also send a signal to countries outside the area of validity of the Water Framework Directive that the European Union itself is serious about the sparing and correct use of water. However, we should consider seriously whether it would be worthwhile establishing separate water cycles in future. We must draw a general distinction between drinking water and process water. This needs to become standard practice worldwide because we cannot stand by and watch as people in developing countries are forced to live with poor quality drinking water that was previously used as service water and process water in industry. We need to make sure that there are separate water cycles for the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue at stake here is a truly decisive matter for the future of the human race, which is why I welcome this motion for a resolution, even though I believe that we need to consider this issue far more intensively. Water is not just a source of life, but also a source of death, triggering wars or murderous conflicts if supplies run short. That is why it is urgently necessary for us to ensure, as Ms Băsescu has said, that appropriate water management is introduced. Above all, however much I favour a social market economy, I believe that limits must be imposed on the fantasies associated with the privatisation of water. This is truly a public asset that belongs to all of the human race. That is why I voted in favour of a corresponding amendment. We need to take care to ensure that water does not become an asset to be used for speculation or blackmail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a great undertaking that calls for ambitious objectives in all areas. The report by our colleague, Chris Davies, has the merit of covering a wide range of issues: from energy efficiency to reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), from the Emissions Trading System to intelligent energy networks and even rail corridors, the areas for action leave no stone unturned so that, by 2050, we should be well and truly committed to a low-carbon economy. We can discuss the objectives and percentages but I believe that this report lays the foundation for what needs to be done. However, I abstained, not because I disagree with the content, but because I think that we should not lead people to believe that nuclear energy is a green energy solution. By including it in the list of low-carbon energy sources in the same category as renewable energy, we are turning a blind eye to the danger and the many risks posed by nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is nothing more than a transitional energy source; it is by no means the energy of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document, in defining a European strategy for the environment, has a major impact on Member States’ industrial policies. The report under discussion proposes yet more stringent requirements than those set out by the Commission, with more ambitious climate targets for 2020 and binding European targets beyond 2030, quite apart from reaching a global climate agreement. I am opposed to any amendment of the commitments that have already been made to reduce emissions by 2020, principally because the commitments to reduce emissions made as part of the ‘Climate and Energy Package’ adopted in 2008 are the outcome of long and difficult political negotiations, which led to a compromise between the Member States on balanced effort-sharing and preserving the competitiveness of the respective sectors involved. Moreover, it is essential for the European Union, in pursuing its climate targets, not to alter the regulatory framework already in place, thereby incurring the risk of further penalising European businesses vis-à-vis their global partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament therefore invites the Commission to bring forward within the next two years the measures necessary to achieve the 2030 objectives taking into account particular national capacities and potential, as well as international progress on climate action. Such measures should be implemented in a coordinated, cost-efficient and effective way. The European Commission should also present a cost-benefit analysis of meeting the proposed pathway at Member State level, taking into account national circumstances stemming from different technological development, as well as the necessary investments (and the attendant social acceptability) and the existence of a wider range of possible global conditions.

At the moment, detailed plans are being drawn up separately for each sector, with the most recent being the document called ‘Energy Roadmap 2050’. Given that it is difficult to estimate the trend in supply and demand, the plan presents several scenarios, along with an analysis of the possible effects, challenges and opportunities produced by modernising the energy system. Other factors taken into account include the possible changes in terms of infrastructure, technology and the price of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is estimated that the price of electricity will rise by 2030. This is why we must invest in ‘smart’ electricity grids and in enhanced technologies for energy production, transport and storage. These measures, combined with the completion of the single energy market, should ensure that prices fall in the long term. The costs will be offset by the long-term nature of the investments, the jobs created and the reduction in the level of dependence on imports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not agree, for example, with the stated notion that 30% of the environmental element of direct payments from the common agricultural policy should be used for an EU-wide regime of incentives aimed at the development of carbon sequestration in the soil. If European agriculture is to be successful on a global scale and as self-sufficient as possible, agricultural land must be used for production, and we must place high demands on it in terms of safety and quality, of course. In relation to the idea of a low-carbon economy, I do not consider the call for an EU commitment to total elimination of CO<span class="sub">2</span> from the energy sector by 2050 to be realistic. Along with reducing emissions of CO<span class="sub">2</span>, it is necessary to bear in mind other targets, such as preserving and increasing EU industrial competitiveness and energy security by being as independent as possible in terms of third country energy supplies. I would like to point out in this context that the existing 20% target for renewables is based on the contribution of nuclear power to the energy mix in many Member States, while the world energy outlook from 2011 drawn up by the International Energy Agency includes a scenario based on a smaller contribution from nuclear energy. The EU should therefore take a critical attitude to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given all that, the obstinacy with which the forces of the right have wanted to put forward the nuclear option again seems simply incomprehensible, and in many ways also outside time and history. It is outside time and history, as are all recommendations on the safety of nuclear power stations, which have several times been served up to us and promptly been refuted by the facts. It is still more unthinkable in a country such as Italy, where almost 30 years after power stations were decommissioned, we still have waste heaps that have not been disposed of and where, not long ago, a new referendum firmly rejected the reintroduction of nuclear power. We therefore demand that a correct objective, the reduction of emissions and the transition to an economy based on renewable sources, should not become the pretext for allowing a means that has proved to be unsafe and dangerous, and one which Europeans have for this reason chosen to replace, creep in again by the back door. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given energy consumption and the flows and patterns thereof, issues such as the production and trading models currently in force, as well as free trade and its impact on the relocation of production, are insufficiently addressed. In the area of transport, for example, the advocating a modern and efficient public transport system with wide coverage and low prices for the public – all of which contrasts with what is currently being done at present in Portugal, for example, under the IMF/EU programme – equates to paving the way for the market, liberalisation and charging on various forms of transport.

CO<span class="sub">2</span> is accumulating in the atmosphere at an accelerating rate. The EU is currently responsible for just 11% of global CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, and our actions alone will not curb the warming process. It can be expected that investing in the development of a low-carbon economy will not weaken Europe’s competitive position, but strengthen it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Europe must develop a sense of urgency, or risk losing the race to maintain a competitive economy. Decisive action is essential if the EU is not to get left behind. Adoption of the Roadmap, and the setting of ambitious goals for the development of a low-carbon economy, provide an opportunity to stimulate progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s Climate and Energy Package was adopted on the assurance that the other large-emitter countries would also be making similar commitments, but this has not happened, and some large economies have already announced that it will not happen in the near future. Moreover, bearing in mind that from the time the package entered into force the Union’s GDP growth has been practically static, in contrast to the situation in other countries that do not apply such measures, I consider that our current climate strategy is putting a brake on economic recovery and that, consequently, adopting new and more stringent limits far into the future, such as those proposed in this report, would put Europe at risk of losing the competitiveness contest in the global market.

With this text, the European Union is defining its long-term vision and continuing to reflect on what will be the outline for a green economy. I am pleased with the adoption of this report which will give greater visibility to the economic and institutional actors over the coming decades with a step-by-step approach for 2030, 2040 and 2050. It is true that deep divides have emerged on the subject of the functioning of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) as the price of carbon is currently very low. The proposal from the parliamentary left to artificially inflate the price of carbon per tonne was unacceptable as it did not take into account the particularly difficult economic and social context of these last few years. In truth, the left has completely failed to take into account the reality of the situation and the difficulties facing our entrepreneurs. Rather than imposing restrictions and ending up out of our depth because we are ignoring the consequences of our actions, we have instead chosen an approach based on prudence and discernment by calling on the European Commission to evaluate the situation and make proposals where appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the provision that we urgently need to back the technologies that will win and invest in the processes that use energy and resources much more efficiently. However, we must not forget that China is still 70% dependent upon coal as a source of electricity and there are no guarantees that the objectives of its current five-year plan, which gives priority to low-carbon ‘green’ investments, will be achieved, even though these investments are on a scale that dwarfs those of Europe. I am convinced that there are genuine grounds to believe that there is a threat of ‘carbon leakage’, of business moving out of Europe to avoid higher costs resulting from the measures being taken to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.

We must therefore find alternative energy sources that are more environmentally friendly yet equally reliable. Through the Europe 2020 strategy, Europe must find innovative ways of promoting economic growth without continuing to affect the environment. However, the 2010 data show that there was a 6% increase in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, as mentioned in this report, Europe is responsible for only 11% of global CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, and our actions alone will not be enough to halt the process of increasing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. This must be a joint effort by all powers, particularly Brazil, Russia, India and China, which are becoming increasingly responsible for CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. What is required of everyone is to ensure the development of a low-carbon economy that is still competitive and does not harm the European economy, which is already very fragile as a result of the global crisis.

EU trading in carbon dioxide emissions was introduced in the European Union through legislation in 2005. Emissions trading links the emission of greenhouse gases to the possession of licences: anyone producing greenhouse gases is only permitted to release the volume of pollutants for which they have emission rights. If a lower level of pollutants is released than permitted, then the surplus rights can be sold on to others. On the other hand, those who produce too many greenhouse gases can purchase additional emissions rights. In addition, there are also generous free limits allowed by the state. All of this opens up opportunities for speculation and bypasses the actual purpose of the scheme, namely the reduction of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. Busy trading in emissions certificates thus does nothing to encourage investment in the establishment of a low-carbon economy.

Indeed, our businesses must already comply with far stricter regulations in a whole multitude of sectors than their direct competitors in other countries.

The new emerging countries, which have staggering growth levels compared to the stagnant European economy, pay absolutely no regard to these problems, just like the United States itself among the rest, which has also never agreed to meet the obligations that all other developed countries have already undertaken for some time. The European Union can set an example by overcoming the challenge of climate change, but definitely not in this self-mutilating manner.

Countries whose emissions are below the upper limit can sell on their surplus rights. On the other hand, countries that produce greenhouse gases in excess of the upper limit can purchase these emissions rights. Because the certificates can be traded in the open market, the price is determined by supply and demand. Trade in emissions certificates presents a number of problems: the market is not transparent and speculators manipulate prices on the trading platforms.

The draft report by Mr Davies proposes to put forward requirements more stringent than those outlined by the Commission; in particular a 25% climate target for 2020 and binding European targets for 2030 and beyond, quite apart from a global climate agreement. Moreover, the report maintains that the Commission must intervene in the current regulatory arrangements of the Emissions Trading System from now until 2020, by withdrawing emissions allowances from the market or increasing the annual linear reduction requirement for emissions at the European level. Both measures, if introduced, would in fact involve an amendment of the decisions taken by Member States regarding Europe’s commitments in the battle against climate change from now to 2020. With this explanation of vote, I wish to express my opposition to amendments that are more stringent than the commitments already entered into as regards reducing emissions by 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In terms of decarbonising the economy, Europe is setting a good example but it cannot act alone. The emissions generated by one country have an impact on all mankind. There are no barriers to stop pollution and action must urgently be taken on a global scale. This concerns various fields: energy, transport, industry, housing, agriculture. An integrated approach is therefore needed in order to create the conditions for true green growth. The fight against global warming is dependent on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy transition with a view to progressively eliminating the use of fossil fuels and more responsible behaviour. We will not achieve all of this in a matter of years, but I believe that, in the long term, sustained efforts are required, as we will pay a greater price if we wait, and we cannot compromise when it comes to protecting our planet and our environment.

At the beginning of February, the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) launched an Internet site calling on people to report complaints arising from the ‘massive labour migration’ of ‘Central or Eastern European citizens’, in particular Poles, Romanians and Bulgarians and asking people whether they have experienced any problems in terms of anti-social behaviour and whether they have lost their jobs to one of those citizens. This attitude is not acceptable; it represents clear discrimination against European citizens and goes against fundamental freedoms, European values of human dignity, freedom, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights and risks destroying the very basis of the Union, which is pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and freedom of movement.

The European Parliament cannot just appoint itself to the bench. I am no fan of this website. It is good for nuisance problems to be tackled, but that is a matter for the police and the justice system. Making a distinction by nationality or ethnic background when dealing with such matters is not good. People are equal before the law. This can also give the impression that Eastern Europeans are predominantly responsible for nuisance. That is a one-sided impression, and it is one that is unjust on these, our fellow European Union citizens, who more often than not work very hard on conditions less favourable than those of Dutch workers. However, I do not endorse the European Parliament’s resolution because it is neither balanced nor nuanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, according to the second paragraph of Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union, Member States must take any general or particular measure to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union (such as the Framework Directive concerning racism and xenophobia). I think that we are faced with blatant discrimination which institutions in the Netherlands are doing nothing about. In addition, the discrimination has the tacit approval of the Dutch Government. This is why the situation is unacceptable. In fact, the European Commission should adopt a very clear stance on initiating infringement proceedings and send a strong message indicating that such acts are not tolerated and that the Treaties must be respected, regardless of the colour of the national flag or the political hue of the government. Otherwise, we will only encourage this kind of behaviour, and governments will be able to hide behind someone else.

Its highly negative and discriminatory nature stems from the possibility to post anonymous complaints against citizens of Central and Eastern European states who are working in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This initiative is the work of a political party with an aggressively populist programme, but the present minority government is dependent on its support in parliament and has concluded an agreement regarding support for the cabinet. The PVV initiative itself precludes any constructive dialogue about the migration of workers from Central and Eastern Europe and fails to resolve any underlying problems such as widespread bad practice in short-term employment agencies. There are already, within the Dutch administrative system, appropriate institutions that are examining all reports and complaints in an impartial manner, without focusing on any ethnic group. In this light, there is no justification for the PVV to usurp these rights and to duplicate the activities of existing state structures. The Netherlands is a beneficiary of the free movement of people, goods and services throughout the European Union. The PVV initiative is strengthening stereotypes of Polish workers in the Netherlands, which are contradicted by the facts – the Dutch economy gains real benefit from their work. For this reason I am counting on EU institutions to come forward with specific measures and on a public and critical response by the Dutch Government to the PVV action, which would demonstrate its constructive approach to developing bilateral relations with Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an exceptionally disturbing development. The creators of the portal claim that this is just a tool against negative behaviour such as crime, alcoholism, drug addiction or littering which have allegedly increased since May 2007, when the Netherlands opened its labour market to the new EU Member States, including Poland. The portal strikes at one of the pillars of the EU, which is the free movement of people, and it is discriminatory, since it is directed exclusively against specific nations. It is also potentially dangerous as it encourages hostile behaviour and provokes fear among the Dutch population. Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, has refused to comment on this matter, stating that the portal arose as the expression of the views of a single political party and that the minority government has not entered into a coalition with that party as regards European issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a region of freedom where every citizen should feel safe and equal irrespective of their place of residence. Openly encouraging intolerance and mutual hatred on the basis of subjective views posted on a website is unacceptable in a free Europe.

Has he forgotten Article 1 of the Dutch constitution which bans discrimination and declares equality for all citizens living on Dutch soil? Has he forgotten the European values of tolerance? Or is he so afraid of losing the support of Geert Wilders’ party that he would turn a blind eye and a deaf ear? Has he forgotten that as a politician his role is precisely to promote living together? Has he forgotten that it is his duty to guarantee European citizens their right to live and work peacefully in the Netherlands?

In this Parliament we are united by the idea that all people are equal. We do not agree with expressions of hatred, intolerance, discrimination and exclusion spoken under populist banners. The facts show that at present the principal place where discrimination is disseminated is the media, particularly the Internet, which provides anonymity. The Internet has become a very important channel of communication which makes it possible to plan and carry out actions in the real world. We must turn this situation to our advantage. For this reason our governments must take practical steps: to ensure that national laws make it possible to prosecute when crimes are committed on-line; to create or extend educational programmes in schools, so that they cover these issues, including a European community/education campaign aimed at encouraging social openness to immigrants as well as assurances that actions aimed at combating crime do not threaten freedom of speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The head of the VVD delegation, Hans van Baalen, has announced a double ‘no’. We are saying ‘no’ to the stigmatising and polarising PVV website, which sends a negative signal to willing workers from Central and Eastern Europe that harms the Netherlands and relations within the EU. The VVD groups in both this House and in the Lower Chamber of the Dutch parliament have therefore spoken out specifically against this website. Furthermore, the heads of the delegations of the VVD and Democrats 66 (D66), together with the chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, issued a statement as far back as 13 February this year. Problems need to be recognised and tackled, but this is not the way to do so. There thus cannot be any misunderstanding about the VVD’s position. We are also saying ‘no’ to this Parliament’s resolution RC7-0152/2012, which is completely disproportionate and also unfairly takes the Dutch Government to task. It is not up to the European Parliament to call the Dutch Government to order about a website for which it has no responsibility. That is a fundamental difference with the Hungarian legislation, which represents a violation of EU Treaties. That is not the issue here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Free movement of people and workers is one of the pillars of the EU Treaty, and in addition studies clearly show that the arrival of labour from the new EU Member States has had a positive influence on the economies of the ‘old’ Member States. I fully agree with the call in the resolution upon the Government of the Netherlands to condemn and distance itself from the actions of its partner party in setting up and maintaining an Internet site directed against the citizens of other EU Member States. In this context I was particularly concerned about the ever-increasing intolerance and lack of solidarity between EU Member States. The EU’s inability to subscribe to common values as a united bloc is reducing its influence in the world, and particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia is trying to exploit the EU’s weakness in order to retain and increase its economic and political influence. Unfortunately, the response of the EU and its Member States to the real economic problems is, essentially, aimed in two fundamentally opposing directions: on the one hand, rapid federalisation of the EU is being promoted, all too often without taking into account the interests of the Member States, and on the other hand an anti-EU attitude, motivated by a narrow nationalism, is gathering strength in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot permit such behaviour in the European Union. The debate on this reprehensible idea is also a debate on the boundaries of free speech. Boundaries that, in this instance, have been brutally transgressed by prejudices stemming from fear. Unfortunately, the Dutch authorities too are unable to rid themselves of this fear. There is no clear condemnation of this website and its creators. This is even more serious since this is a breach of the statements adopted as part of EQUINET. This was created in order to strengthen measures supporting equal treatment on a European level. Today the Netherlands, a member of EQUINET, has quickly forgotten its obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe there is a certain dangerous tendency to restrict access to the common market by citizens of the new Member States. Truly awful ideas to suspend the Schengen area, to introduce limits on economic migrants from Central Europe or racist Internet websites; all of these are symptoms of the rotten mentality of their creators. Our reaction is therefore key. Commissioners Viviane Reding and Cecilia Malmström should have intervened in this matter long ago and should have considered the compliance of the translations and entries on the website with European Union law. It is my hope that the European Parliament will adopt the resolution condemning the website’s creators and will ask for it to be closed down.

This vote, which was once again marred by fraud in spite of the installation of webcams that were supposed to ensure its smooth running, was a mockery of an election. The massive protest movement that has spread across Russia since the controversial legislative elections in December means that Vladimir Putin can no longer act as if the opposition did not exist. Twenty years after the fall of the Soviet regime, Vladimir Putin must listen to the opposition and implement the reforms needed for the transition to democracy and respect for human rights. It is for all of these reasons that I supported Parliament’s motion for a resolution on this subject, in which the European Union is calling on Russia to implement deep reforms to its political system and put in place a true rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like those that preceded them, these elections were marked by the international community’s doubts about the whole process and, while it is not likely that they have cast the winner into doubt, they may at least cast doubt on the scale of Mr Putin’s victory. Unequivocal compliance with better international standards is therefore required. Russia is facing a significant strategic challenge, and it is to be expected that it will have to choose between its recent alignment with China and closeness to Europe. Despite the recent partnership between Russia and China in support of the Syrian regime, I believe that, in the medium and long term, Russia is bound to recognise that its interests will be better served if it opts for increased closeness with the West.

The criticism being levelled today, including that which underlies this resolution, demonstrates the EU’s famous policy of double standards. The EU, like the US in fact, has already realised that the Russian Government is not prepared to submit entirely to its interests. Since it is impossible to conceal its role of serving the national plutocracy, the Russian Government has blocked the interests of these two regions, while preserving its national resources from foreign interests, particularly in terms of energy. More recently, Russia’s veto in the UN Security Council on military intervention in Syria meant that the US and the EU saw their expansionist aims blocked. In short, what is worrying the EU and the US is not the defence of democracy, but their desire for Russia to have a government that is more open to satisfying their undisguisable interests and ambitions for imperial domination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU and Russia are mutually dependent but the EU’s strategic partner is not afraid of exploiting the disadvantages EU Member States face in energy for instance.

I would agree with the experts that many Russians were scared of noisy opposition rallies, and demands to change the government and organise repeat elections to the Duma.

It is the opposite of the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras of street politics when reforms had a severe impact on ordinary people. I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which highlights that the significant activity by citizens recently should continue and turn into a social movement forcing the government to completely reform the political system and also simplify the rules governing the procedures for the registration of political parties and candidates in Presidential elections and their participation in elections.

The text of this motion for a resolution strongly criticises the shortcomings and irregularities in the preparation and conduct of these elections, highlighting in particular the unequal treatment of the Russian broadcast media towards candidates during the electoral campaign and condemning the arrest of dozens of protestors during the demonstrations. Furthermore, it stresses, in full support of the political modernisation agenda, the necessity of a critical engagement with Russia on the part of the EU.

In spite of the numerous infringements in the electoral process, we must acknowledge that Russians would have elected Putin as president according to the country’s current legislation, regardless of whether it was in the first or second round. The next six years mean the need for cooperation with Russia under this president, the continuation of negotiations on a new partnership, the expansion of mutually beneficial economic relations and for progress to be achieved in reaching consensus on values and the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">One matter of particular concern is the difficult and extremely restrictive process for smaller parties, especially opposition parties, to register to participate in elections. This is an area where the EU must be very insistent on using all its leverage to ensure that the procedures are eased and more parties are allowed to take part in public and political life. The strong, unprecedented wave of protests in the wake of the Russian parliamentary elections in December and the presidential elections in March are evidence of an awakening and change in Russian society.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are currently witnessing hostile rhetoric from the newly-elected president towards the opposition movements and protests, the strong central authorities will not be able not to take account of this new reality in Russia. Let us contribute in a considerate, uncompromising manner to getting rid of the policies promoting restriction and repression in public and political life in Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When an attempted monetary reform by the Central Bank ended disastrously, Chernomyrdin said: ‘we hoped for the best but it turned out as usual’. Nowadays, Russians laconically use Chernomyrdin’s fatalistic phrase to describe their everyday situation. When it comes to democracy in Russia we are still hoping for the best and yet tragically things turn out as usual. In December, this house passed a resolution on the Duma elections urging Moscow to hold ‘free and democratic presidential elections’ and yet the March vote too turned out as usual. The OSCE stated that the presidential elections were ‘clearly skewed’ in favour of Putin and that overly-prescriptive rules on registration limited competition. Russia is an important partner for the EU and it is vital for our mutual prosperity that we boost trade ties. However it is difficult to build commercial links when Russia is crying out for democratic reform. European companies are also put off by the level of corruption and the lack of respect for the rule of law. We must see real and lasting change in Russia if it is to become a meaningful partner for the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The general election rules in Russia remain overly complex and unclear and are applied inconsistently. The resolution also calls for a transparent analysis of the electoral irregularities, so that in the future the election system may be improved. The retention of the existing system in Russia is unfortunately a precondition for it to continue to also maintain its existing conception of foreign policy, which is based on empire-building ambitions and dreams of keeping hold of and increasing power and influence in Russia’s neighbouring states. It makes me anxious that the not altogether legitimate results of the Russian presidential elections will now serve for many years as the basis for the policy implemented towards Latvia by our neighbour state in attempts both to destabilise the domestic political situation and to gain economic influence, particularly in the transport and energy sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fact that when there were suspicions of electoral fraud in the presidential elections of 1996, neither the EU nor the US refrained from praising Russian democracy and the election of the candidate who suited them at the time: namely Boris Yeltsin. The US and the EU have already realised that the Russian Government is not prepared to submit entirely to their imperialist interests. The Russian Government has been demonstrating this through a certain economic and political independence, as well as defending its national resources, particularly in terms of energy, and advocating the role of the state in certain strategic sectors. More recently, Russia’s veto in the United Nations Security Council on military intervention in Syria meant that the US and the EU saw their expansionist aims blocked. The issue worrying the EU and the US, therefore, is not the defence of democracy, but their desire for Russia to have a government that better serves their interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is becoming increasingly evident that the regime of President Nursultan Nazarbayev is moving increasingly further away from any democratic standard. This is highlighted by the Head of State’s re-election with 95% of the votes in April last year, having been in office since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Not to mention his party winning the parliamentary elections in January with 81% of the vote, along with the brutal suppression of the strikes by oil workers and of the pro-democratic demonstrations expressing solidarity with the victims of the bloody repression of the workers’ protests.</p>

This repression is taking place in a context in which Kazakhstan is the subject of geostrategic interests aimed at controlling and appropriating its natural resources, in particular hydrocarbons. The interests of multinationals also come together here, and they see this country’s joining the World Trade Organisation as a unique opportunity to satisfy their insatiable desire for domination.

The human rights situation in Kazakhstan has long been deteriorating, and has recently become particularly serious. Here I refer not only to the tragic events that took place in the Zhanaozen district, but also to the arrest and imprisonment of opposition leaders and journalists. Therefore it is important that the European Union should from now on very attentively monitor developments in these areas, and the next steps in partnership and cooperation negotiations with Kazakhstan should be dependent on the progress of political reforms. Since the European Parliament report strongly emphasises these principles, I also supported this report in the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is important to clarify the way in which the government acted towards the protesters in Zhanaozen, and to wait for the investigation by the national commission that has been established, with UN monitoring. Moreover, along with the negotiations for a stronger EU-Kazakhstan agreement, the EU must show its concern about the watering down of fundamental and democratic rights, and must warn the authorities of the need for reforms.

We reject this drift towards constant attempts at foreign interference which, curiously enough, does not apply to countries whose governments sing from the same hymn sheet. We strongly condemn the brutal repression of workers’ rights and their struggle, in particular through the changes to the labour code enabling workers who go on strike to be dismissed; abolishing restrictions on dismissing trade union representatives in negotiations during strikes; legalising lock-outs; and enabling courts to declare any strike illegal. However, we would distance ourselves from those who seek to demonise Kazakhstan through interference that creates the preconditions for the appropriation of its natural resources, in particular hydrocarbons, by multinationals, which will be facilitated by the country’s membership of the World Trade Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A contribution to put a definitive end to this awful situation is a wider examination of the root causes of the conflict. It is essential to avoid simplistic explanations based only on the label ‘terrorism’ or ‘religion’. Although Nigeria is the world’s eighth largest oil producer, the majority of its 148 million inhabitants live below the poverty line. A peaceful resolution of conflicts implies fair access to resources and a redistribution of revenues from the oil market. In addition to that, we must reaffirm the importance of an independent, impartial and accessible judiciary system to stop the impunity and to enhance respect for the rule of law and the fundamental rights of the population. For all these reasons, with this text we called upon the Federal Government of Nigeria to fight corruption, poverty and inequality and to push for reforms aimed at creating a democratic, stable, free state which takes into account human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the country is the world’s eighth-largest oil producer, the majority of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. The events of these last few months with the increased violence against the religious communities, in particular the persecution of Christians in the north of the country by the Boko Haram sect and the execution of European hostages on 8 March, called for greater public awareness. That is why Parliament, echoing the High Representative’s statements, has strongly condemned this violence and reiterated that religious freedom is a fundamental and unquestionable right. However, the causes of these attacks cannot be put down to mere inter-religious or inter-ethnic tensions. They are very often the result of exploiting poverty and manipulating fears. The Nigerian authorities are already taking various measures to combat insecurity and I welcome this. Nonetheless, the efforts in terms of governance and development with the help of EU support must be accentuated so as to stabilise the north of the country. For security is inextricably linked to development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This escalation of violence and conflict between different religious and ethnic groups has led to economic, social and political stagnation in the country. Although Nigeria is a country that is extremely rich in natural resources, and the eighth-largest oil producer in the world, it is facing a social scourge whereby the majority of its 148 million inhabitants live below the poverty line.

The language used in this motion for a resolution is intentionally soft in the face of an extremely serious situation, as it seeks to focus attention on what is essentially a consequence – the strengthening of terrorist organisations – in order to ignore the roots of the whole problem: namely, the unbridled exploitation of the country’s natural resources; corruption and violence fuelled by the major multinational oil companies; and massive poverty. It is not enough to ask the oil companies to contribute and take more responsibility when we are talking about companies that have committed the greatest crimes against the Nigerian people and caused irreparable environmental damage, as in the Niger delta. It is certainly telling that the government of one of Africa’s biggest oil producers has suspended fuel subsidies.

Firstly, in spite of the progress made, we must achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals and continue in our fight, particularly to improve access to sanitation. Secondly, we must ensure water management through drainage basins and deal with the problems of pollution at source. Finally, I would like to mention the idea of ‘1% solidarity for water’, a principle that has been applied in France and that allows for the collection of funds to improve access to water and sanitation in developing countries. Following the adoption of this text by my colleagues in the European Parliament, I presented a broad overview of it on Friday morning to the 35 000 participants at the World Water Forum. The European Union, developed countries and humanitarian aid organisations must now step up their efforts both in terms of financial assistance and technical support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, in my view, water is too precious and essential to the survival of both mankind and ecosystems to be left to private interests. Although, for some uses, water may at times be considered as a commodity, it is most certainly not a commodity like any other.

Water is a shared resource of humankind and, therefore, should not be a source of profit. Access to water should constitute a fundamental and universal right. The United Nations recognises the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, as derived from the right to an adequate standard of living, and it is therefore essential for all necessary efforts to be made to guarantee access to water for the most deprived populations by 2015. We need to balance water uses to satisfy water demand and ensure availability as well as quality, in particular in developing countries. Water is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which could lead to a decline in the quantity and quality of water available, particularly drinking water, as well as to a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. Risk prevention, mitigation and response strategies to prevent water-related extreme phenomena are thus crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Access to drinking water is restricted around the world. According to the data provided by the UN Environment Programme, 884 million people do not have access to clean water, while approximately 2.3 billion people do not have the opportunity to use even the most basic sanitation facilities. The problems of dwindling drinking water resources and expanding deserts, which were more likely in the past to be issues affecting Africa and Asia, are knocking at Europe’s door. In southern Spain the desert is extending by one kilometre every year. Oltenia in Romania is exposed to a similar process, but it is progressing at a slower rate, while drinking water resources in other regions of the world have become grounds for conflict between states. Last but not least, there is the well-known official statement from Yemen that by 2017 it will become the first state in the world not to have its own natural water source. In view of the above-mentioned problems, I think that the sustainable use of water is as much an economic as an environmental necessity, which would require more transparent water pricing schemes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore calling for access to drinking water to be better taken into consideration in regional development policies. In Europe too, access to water for all users must be ensured and decentralised action must be taken quickly at regional and local level. Parliament was keen to remind Member States of their obligations under the Water Framework Directive to achieve good water status by 2015. The dialogue and debates in Marseille during the 6th World Water Forum should encourage the implementation of ‘water governance’ and thereby allow for commitments to be made at global level during the Rio+20 conference in June in Brazil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hand in hand with this should be the drafting of the main global indicators of quality, quantity, achievability and affordability of water and indicators for the effective use of water resources at river basin level. In this context, I support the development of unified river basin plans at a global level, and I would like to emphasise the primary role of river basin plans in applying EU policy in the area of water management in line with the Water Framework Directive. Regional and local bodies must also play an important role in economic solutions to global water problems, and in preventing bribery. The Commission should accede to the UN Convention on International Water Courses on behalf of the EU, and encourage the entry into force of amendments to the Helsinki Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Water Courses and International Lakes of 1992 with the aim of extending the scope of this instrument to countries that are not members of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The EU should also encourage broader ratification of the Protocol on Water and Health to the Helsinki Convention of 1992, in the interests of coordinated and equitable management of water in national and international river basins. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resulting longer storage periods mean that chlorine needs to be used to prevent bacterial contamination and sulphur tends to build up in waste water pipes. Thus anyone seeking to encourage people to save water by increasing water costs is not thinking with sufficient foresight. If groundwater consumption has increased threefold within 50 years, this is mainly because surface water has been rendered unsuitable or too expensive for producing drinking water due to fertilisers or pollutants. EU development aid will therefore not only have to deal with reducing population growth, but also increasingly with the disposal of waste water. As well as exploiting potential savings in agriculture in southern Member States, it is also necessary to reduce the volume of fertilisers and pollutants.

<p class="contents">I am pleased about the following aspects: one of the eight Millennium Development Goals has been achieved (ensuring a sustainable environment). Eighty-nine per cent of the global population now has access to water, meaning that over six billion human beings are connected to a drinking water network or have access to clean wells.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do have some concerns. Almost 800 million people are still unable to drink clean water. Where is Europe in all this? In view of the scarcity of water resources and the repeated droughts, Europe must obviously secure its supply of water through efficient use in agriculture and the urban environment. There are also other paths to explore: on the one hand, developing woodland areas with a view to protecting soils and water, on the other, turning to good agricultural practices in order to fight against abusive use of water contaminants (nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides) which have harmful effects on human health and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to climate change, there are fears of a decline in the quantity and quality of water available, particularly drinking water, as well as a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. It is therefore necessary to rationalise water use and the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution calls for more efficient water usage especially in the sectors where most water is used, such as the agriculture sector. Also, the resolution underlines the need to make concrete commitments towards the promotion and protection of water resources, especially in light of the upcoming Rio+20 conference.

<p class="contents">In addition, as my colleague Ms Rivasi said earlier, access to drinking water has been recognised as a fundamental right since 2010, but we must do more. We must constitutionalise this right and promote comprehensive management of water as a global shared resource. In order to do so, we cannot allow private companies to hold the reins of the water market. In France, the delegation of public services has again been called into question and we are seeing an increase in local authorities taking back control of water management, which ecologists are delighted about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
