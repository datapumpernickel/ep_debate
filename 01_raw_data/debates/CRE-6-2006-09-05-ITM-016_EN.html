<p class="contents">With respect to illegal immigration, the Commission outlined the areas it considers to be future priorities in a communication which, as you know, was adopted on 19 July. The communication in particular explores how to further secure external borders, for instance by introducing intelligence-led ‘e-borders’ management and addresses the possible creation of an automated entry-exit system, the issue of regularisations and the need to tackle employment of illegally resident third country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to underline that in July the Commission adopted a proposal on establishing a mechanism for the creation of rapid border intervention teams. This mechanism, that will strengthen the solidarity between Member States and the Community, will allow Member States which face extraordinary obstacles in controlling their external borders to make use of the expertise and manpower of border guards of other Member States on a temporary basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The answers are reassuring in that both these candidate countries, which are close to joining, realise what impact dual citizenship may have on the other European Union Member States. They have, however, posed us a problem that the European Union should be concerned about. It is the problem of countries like Ukraine and Moldova, which are demanding a new facilitation scheme for temporary EU entry visas. If we do not give serious consideration to these demands for a visa scheme for Ukraine and Moldova, the citizens of those countries will obviously try to resort to dangerous stratagems.</p>

However, growing reserves of crude oil or petroleum products in any consumer country should normally not put upward pressure on the world oil price.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a well-documented statistical belief among experts that prices of oil and oil products increasingly relax with growing levels of reserves in major consumer countries. That is because risk premium is an important element in the price of oil in the world markets and is priced in by market operators on the basis of evaluations of various risk factors. Besides due political considerations, the probability of supply disruptions caused by insufficient spare capacities and reserve levels is a primary risk factor. Hence comfortable or even record levels of crude oil or petroleum product reserves in important consumer countries such as the United States tend to reduce the perception of risk by a vast majority of operators in global oil markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, there was no need to discuss the question of levels of US crude oil and petroleum product reserves at the annual EU-US Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the crude oil imports from the US to the European Union, in the past three years the United States has supplied negligible quantities to the EU – less than one million tonnes per annum. That is less than 0.2% of EU’s total crude oil imports. In fact, the US itself is highly and increasingly dependent on crude oil imports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that it is estimated that 25% of all cancers in the European Union could be attributed to smoking. The World Health Organisation, the Finnish and German Governments and US agencies have already classified environmental tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen. As I have said to Parliament on many occasions in the past, action towards a smoke-free Europe is one of my main priorities. Before the end of 2006, the Commission intends to put forward a document on smoke-free environments, which will discuss the way forward to tackle passive smoking in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that DG Sanco’s informal consultation did not mention the classification of ETS as a carcinogen, firstly because it had a preliminary and informal character and it tried to get the opinion of selected players. However, we place great importance on Parliament’s view that classifying tobacco smoke as a carcinogen would be advisable.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is legal and not political, because we agree. There is a gap in the European legislation, so I would cover two aspects. Firstly, we have the problem that the existing legislation in the European Union that deals with dangerous products and substances does not cover smoke as such, but only products placed on the market. Therefore there is a gap there in the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the approach was similar to the legislation that deals with protection from carcinogens in the workplace. These two pieces of legislation unfortunately apply only to substances and preparations placed on the market. Under the purposes and intentions of these pieces of legislation, tobacco smoke as such is not considered a product.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two approaches. On the one hand, in the consultation document we are to bring forward on the smoke-free environment, we shall ensure that we refer to the classification of ETS as a carcinogen – the one made by WHO, the US, Germany and Finland, so that we give the right information. At the same time, as components and ingredients of the smoke are already classified under European legislation as carcinogens – such as arsenic, butadiene, benzene, nitrogen oxides and other oxides – we shall ensure that we make reference to that as well. Therefore, legally we cannot say at this point that ETS is a carcinogen, but we can say that ETS contains components and substances which are carcinogens. I think the message is quite strong. This is what we can do in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the mean time and in the long run, we hope to find ways and explore the possibilities of how we can use or amend in that respect European legislation so that we have the possibility of classifying ETS as such as a carcinogen. This can be done both by exploring amendments to our legislation. There is also an ongoing debate now on the review of the legislation on carcinogens in the workplace, and perhaps we should consider including that as well. That would apply to the workplace, but it would be a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we will present every possible aspect in the paper which will be published soon – before the end of the year. However, in the meantime we will look at how to improve our existing legislation to ensure that we also have the legal competence to classify ETS as such as a carcinogen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Would you consider enacting a Europe-wide regulation according to which certain areas would have to be smoke-free, and with this actually being monitored, since controls on this are, to a great degree, more or less effective from one Member State to another? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very much encouraged that one Member State after another is introducing smoking bans in public places. Lithuania and Slovenia recently took similar decisions, and Germany will also do so in the near future. However, for the European Community as a whole, the Commission will await the outcome of the consultation process before deciding what steps to take. As I said in my hearing before the committees in Parliament, my target would be to have a smoke-free Europe and to protect all citizens from passive smoking, not just in some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal view is that just separating smokers from non-smokers is not enough and does not offer sufficient protection. If we really want to achieve benefits for all we have to go for full smoking bans.

Since, however, this area is one of particular importance to smaller and medium-sized businesses, the Commission is endeavouring to act as an intermediary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have ensured that tried and tested procedures have been publicised, and have encouraged Member States to adopt them. In the Commission’s view, its work is focused on preventing insolvencies and promoting restructuring rather than on the winding up of businesses. We are working towards more business-friendly provisions for non-fraudulent insolvencies, and we are, finally, giving consideration to how to support new starts and give businesses a second chance.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference is made in the European Charter for Small Enterprises to the fact that some insolvencies can occur despite the exercise of responsible initiative and entrepreneurial risk-taking, and a review of national insolvency laws in the light of proven best practice is accordingly called for. Various steps have been taken to this end. Early in 2001, a seminar on the failure of enterprises was held in Noordwijk, at which the most important issues discussed were the improvement of bankruptcy legislation and the prevention of insolvencies. In mid-2002, the study ‘Bankruptcy and a Fresh Start’ was published, including a collection of data on the legal and social consequences of business insolvencies.</p>
<p class="contents">This survey formed the basis for the Commission’s Best Procedure project 'Restructuring, bankruptcy and a fresh start’ in 2003, which focused on the two issues of to what extent national insolvency law was an obstacle to an enterprise’s continued existence and to its making a new start, and what effect the blemish of failure has on the prospects for success of a business making a new start after failure and on the culture of entrepreneurship in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcomes of this project were presented in a report intended to support the trend in European policymaking towards changes in the legal framework of insolvency legislation. The principal recommendations and benchmarks ranged from an emphasis on the usefulness of external advice in preventing insolvencies via the role of up-to-date and reliable insolvency legislation in promoting settlements and restructuring measures through to the importance of drawing a clear distinction between fraudulent and non-fraudulent bankruptcy, while the report also set out the various relevant legal consequences. It did indeed help to step up efforts across Europe towards the reform of insolvency law.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to a number of positions adopted in the ‘Entrepreneurship in Europe’ Green Paper, the Commission, in 2004, expanded the Entrepreneurship Action Plan by including in it a priority measure on business insolvencies with three specific objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these was that the Member States should be encouraged to implement the recommendations of the group of experts on ‘restructuring, bankruptcy and a fresh start’. The second was that business failure should be better understood, and the third was the promotion of preventive measures for businesses at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the second and third objectives, the Commission is currently developing, as part of the multiannual ‘Stigma of Failure and Early Warning Instruments’ project, an information kit and self-assessment tests enabling entrepreneurs to recognise at an early stage, when the prospects of getting help are still good, the risk factors by which their business is affected.</p>
<p class="contents">On 28 March 2006, the Commission staged a conference in Brussels on the subject of ‘Insolvency and a fresh start’, which looked at the methods for preventing insolvencies, the ways whereby the stigma of business failure might be counteracted, and the encouragement of fresh starts following non-fraudulent business insolvencies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are positive signs of these priorities being acted on at national level, with the national reform programmes for 2005 in connection with the Lisbon Strategy presented by approximately one-third of the Member States – and I might add that Greece is among them – including plans for the reform of the Member States' bankruptcy laws. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposals put forward by the Commission for a modern industrial policy are specifically intended not only to make the fullest possible use of European industry’s potential for employment, but also to extend it still further.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, then, a quite direct connection between employment policy and industrial policy. I am obliged to you for your question, since it gives me the opportunity to clarify that the industry policy to which I am committed – as also is the Commission – is not one that defends the interests of ‘shareholder value’; on the contrary, the object of this industry policy is to secure in the long term high-quality jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The main goal of the policy I defend is to provide people with good-quality jobs, and enough of them. Contrary to one point of view that was formerly to be heard in Europe, we are, today, more than ever convinced that this goal will not be achieved without a strong industrial base in Europe, that is to say, industry that is strong, high-performing and competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to bring to your attention certain aspects of our policy that have to do quite specifically with the connection between industrial policy and employment policy. One I would mention in particular is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has now – at the Commission’s suggestion – been set up, the funds allocated to which are primarily intended to help workers affected by rapid structural changes to gain further qualifications or find new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out to you that the Commission is currently working on a policy intended to remedy the skills shortages in Europe, improving the content of jobs and improving employment opportunities in numerous sectors, specifically in information and communications technology, machine-building, the textile and leather industry and various areas of raw materials production and manufacturing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also helping to improve the functioning of working relationships and is strongly supportive of corporate social responsibility. Your question also provides me with an opportunity to say to European businesses that the achievement of high profits can never be a business’ sole objective, for a European business always has a social function to fulfil; it has a responsibility to society, and that responsibility primarily has to do with the jobs it provides.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, considering our industrial policy in complete isolation from employment policy would be a quite artificial distinction to draw. It can, perhaps, be summed up in a single sentence. Modern industrial policy in Europe is a quite essential and indispensable contribution to the improvement of employment opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I likewise do not see any incompatibility between competition policy and employment policy. I just think that perhaps we should put more emphasis on employment policy in future. It is important for us to have a strong industrial policy in Europe if we are to be able to retain employment opportunities. In the light of demographic development, it is also important, however, for the employment opportunities in this sector to be of high quality and for us to focus on areas like skills development so that young people are attracted to going into the industrial sector. With competition in mind, it must not become difficult to recruit new workers. It is a very important task to solve this problem, given the way the demographics are heading.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, the services sector cannot be developed at all without strong industry – a strong manufacturing industry – to purchase its services.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the economic reality in Member States with a particularly high proportion of service industries, we see that many of the activities of the services sector have been contracted out by industry, but are exactly the same in substance as before.

I shall give a summary, therefore, which will also help the President save time.</p>
<p class="contents">Cutting red tape and reducing administrative costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, including by improving the quality of our legislation, is one of this Commission’s major political projects. That is what this Commission stands for.</p>
<p class="contents">We have brought about a real paradigm shift. We are currently undertaking a systematic screening of the whole body of European legislation – and by this I mean really law by law, provision by provision – to see whether it can be simplified, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, and whether it contains requirements that put obstacles in their way.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House knows, the Commission has put SME policy in its rightful place at the heart of our economic thinking, as it is they, rather than large enterprises, that are the decisive force in Europe, and what they need is to be given more freedom and more responsibility for their own affairs. They need an environment in which they can develop.</p>
<p class="contents">We firmly believe that the ‘Bureaucracy reduction and better lawmaking’ project is a cross-cutting task for the whole of the Commission, a task that involves all the Directorates-General, and will make a vital contribution to strengthening the role of SMEs and encouraging more people in Europe to start up their own business, to take a risk themselves, and thereby provide jobs for others.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in the interests of time, I would perhaps suggest I provide the honourable Member with the full version of my answer, which details all these initiatives, and I am also willing to provide any further information required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without wanting to anticipate the report the Commission is due to present at the end of this year, I believe I can say one thing, which is that positive effects are indeed starting to emerge. They can be seen in the policies of Member States, and even in the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if the honourable Members had the same feeling as I did when reading the newspaper today, but for the first time in a long time we read that production growth in Europe and economic growth in general has overtaken that of Japan and the USA. We are now, once more, growing faster than our American and Japanese competitors. That means that the gap is beginning to close, and I hope that this trend will continue.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Figures for spring hunt in Malta</span></p>
<p class="contents">Since Malta’s accession to the EU in 2004, thousands of European citizens have been outraged by the decision of the Maltese Government to allow hunting in spring. MEPs have since been pushing the Commission to ban spring hunting in Malta, the derogation being incompatible with the EU Birds Directive (79/409/CEE<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). In its answer to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2006-1318_EN.html">E-1318/06</a> in June 2006 the Commission stated that it had severe doubts about the Maltese claim that the hunting opportunities in autumn were minimal and that therefore spring derogation was justifiable. However, the Commission urged the Maltese authorities to present additional statistics to justify their claim.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission tell us if it has received any (satisfying) additional figures so far and, if not, when finally the Commission is expecting to make a decision on the compatibility of the spring hunting derogation in Malta in order to open and shut the case file? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It only allows it when certain preconditions apply, the main one of which is that there are no satisfactory alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, certain Member States which requested this sort of derogation were unable to prove that there were no satisfactory alternatives to hunting, for example in the autumn period.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why hunting is banned in the spring period is because wild birds are migrating to their reproduction sites. They are birds that have survived the winter and numerous other hardships and are going to the sites where they reproduce. Consequently, there is a basic reason not to allow hunting of wild birds during this period.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, as far as Malta is concerned, we asked for information on birds hunted during the 2004 period from the Maltese Government as far back as the autumn of 2004. The Maltese authorities have sent us the relevant data for the 2004 spring hunting period.</p>
<p class="contents">We concluded from these data, which the Commission evaluated carefully in order to investigate if the grounds for a derogation really stood up, in other words that there was no satisfactory alternative hunting during other periods, that such preconditions applied. As a result, given that during the autumn period there is a significant number of quail and turtle doves which is not very different from the number of birds hunted during the spring period and taking account of the judgments of the European Court of Justice, we concluded that there is a satisfactory alternative and that the derogation is not therefore permissible.</p>
<p class="contents">Having established this, the Commission started legal proceedings against Malta in July 2006 for infringement of the Birds Directive on the grounds that it had permitted spring hunting of these two species.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that similar infringement proceedings have also been set in motion against other Member States on the basis of the desired derogation for which the necessary preconditions are not met and that judgments have been returned, for example against Spain and Finland recently, on precisely these grounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 47 by Caroline Lucas (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0604_EN.html">H-0604/06</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Study into conservation basis of EU ban on import of wild birds</span></p>
<p class="contents">In October last year, the Commission initiated an EU ban on the import of wild caught birds. This decision was made on human health grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">This trade should also be banned on the grounds that it is largely unsustainable, causing crashes in the populations of many birds in the wild. The EU imports an estimated two million birds each year. The Commission should therefore be congratulated for helping to save over one million birds since October.</p>
<p class="contents">When questioned about the conservation impact of this trade, Commissioner Dimas assured environment ministers in December 2005 that the Commission would review the impact of this trade on conservation grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appears not to have initiated such a study. Can the Commission explain why this has not been started, and when the Commission intends to honour its pledge?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 48 by John Bowis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0674_EN.html">H-0674/06</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Ban on wild bird imports</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission conduct a thorough study on the effect of the temporary ban on wild bird imports, with data from all Member States? Illegal trade is difficult to measure, but it has been estimated that huge numbers of protected wild-caught birds are involved, and the argument that a total ban on the import of wild birds would drive the trade underground and cause an increase in illegally imported birds has been widely used by those who oppose a trade ban. However, preliminary analysis of data collected since October 2005 (when the temporary ban was established) published in a new RSPCA/Eurogroup for Animal Welfare report, shows that in fact the illegal trade has reduced, and that the fears are not justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as veterinary and hygiene rules are concerned, the Commission took swift and effective preventive measures in October 2005 based on the existing framework of veterinary legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We had granted an extension to the import ban for all birds up to 31 May 2006; we granted a new extension up to 31 December 2006 and, due to developments in the issue of the spread of bird 'flu, there will most probably be a new extension.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also asked the European Food Safety Authority for an expert opinion on questions of the health and survival conditions of the animals which concern the importation of birds other than poultry. This expert opinion is expected in October 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the protection of biodiversity and wild birds, the Commission, following the Council last December, commissioned a study in January 2006 to examine the efficacy of Community regulations on the trade in wild species of flora and fauna.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic framework for taking protective and trade measures is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species or CITES, which has been transposed into the law of the European Union in the regulations on trading in species of wild flora and fauna. For the time being, these regulations permit imports, provided that they do not endanger the regime for protecting species.</p>
<p class="contents">The competent scientific committee of the European Union with which all the scientific authorities of the Member States of the European Union cooperate is responsible for examining imports of wild species of flora and fauna. That is where the necessary measures are taken relating to imports of species when a problem is identified; this does not only cover birds but relates to all species.</p>
<p class="contents">The study we have commissioned will cover from a broad perspective the issue of the efficacy of these regulations for the protection of species of wild flora and fauna, with the emphasis on wild birds. The results of the study in question are expected to be available by the middle of 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Account will, of course, be taken during the preparation of this study of the conclusions of the report published by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the European Group for the Animal Survival Conventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that the study has at least started, despite the fact that we are having to wait until mid-2007, when it was first requested in December 2005. That seems to be quite a long way away, but let us hope it is worth the wait.</p>
<p class="contents">Could you explain why the EU continues to import birds when countries such as the United States, for example, consider that those same birds are not sustainably harvested? Since 1992 the US has imposed a moratorium on all CITES-listed birds unless it can be scientifically proven that they are harvested in a sustainable way. Since 1992 not a single one has been proved to be sustainably harvested. Many developing countries also have bans on the export of those birds. So how is it that the United States has such a different assessment from the EU as to whether or not they are being sustainably harvested? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has different rules; it has a general ban but it also has exemptions. We have more or less the same result by having species considered separately. However, the results are more or less the same because the United States has a lot of illegal trade and we also have illegal trade. The Commission will look at what the United States is doing and what the results are. While the United States bans all imports, we have to look at it and see whether, firstly, this general ban will increase the illegal trade. We do not know. The study shows that perhaps we have less illegal trade, but we do not know what will happen in the future. If we introduce a permanent ban for birds we will have to consider how and why they are treated differently from all other species, like corals and reptiles, because we have a comprehensive policy. The United States has a different approach to this.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to consider whether an unlimited trade ban by the United States could be challenged by exporting countries, for example within the framework of the World Trade Organization. This might also challenge and undermine our existing sophisticated restrictive measures which make it possible for the European Union to take temporary measures on a consultation basis with the exporting countries. But still, we will look at a ban with derogations in our study. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The amount of seized and confiscated birds in the European Union may have recently decreased because of the current temporary ban on all imports. No birds are offered for any import procedures since they would automatically and immediately be refused. Of particular concern is that birds are still being traded illegally and seized in Member States. They are imported and introduced without any veterinary controls. Again, we shall see what the study tells us and whether a ban with derogations would be a better solution than the current system, which is a case-by-case examination of species.

My question is that our current system for regulating the wild bird trade requires proof that it is harmful to wild populations before it can be suspended. Why can we not establish the sustainability of a wild bird or a species before trade begins? In fact, that should apply to all species, not just birds. Also, the EU prohibits trade in its own wild birds under the Birds and Habitats directives. At the same time, we continue to adopt a cavalier approach towards the biodiversity of less developed countries through this trade, even though there is a ban for the moment. Is that an acceptable way to continue? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We came to the conclusion that the M-30 ring road project was not subject to a proper impact assessment pursuant to Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, in particular with regard to some of the subprojects into which the M-30 ring road project is divided. There has also been a failure to produce an assessment of the cumulative effects of those projects. That is the main problem. The project was split into 19 subprojects. For some subprojects there are impact assessments, but not for all, and there is no overall impact assessment for the whole project.

The Commission had hoped that the opening of accession negotiations would give a more tangible impetus to the reform process. As regards the difficulties faced by non-Muslim and Muslim religious minorities, there is clearly a lack of progress so far.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, non-Muslim religious communities continue to encounter significant problems: they lack a legal personality, face restricted property rights and interference in the management of their foundations, and are not allowed to train clergy. The Commission would also mention that the Alevi community experiences difficulties in terms of recognition of places of worship, representation in relevant state bodies as well as in compulsory religious education.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the draft law on Foundations, currently pending in the Turkish Parliament – and for too long – would only address some of these difficulties, namely the property regime for some of the communities, although not all of them. The Commission has repeatedly urged the Turkish authorities and the Turkish Grand National Assembly to amend the draft law on Foundations to bring it into line with relevant European standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Isolation of northern Cyprus</span></p>
<p class="contents">In 2004 the EU pledged its obligation to sustain economic development and European integration in the north of Cyprus. Reducing the economic divide between the two sides would also reduce the costs of reunification for Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriot dependence on Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that Turkey's accession and the UN settlement process are complementary rather than competing, would the Commission explain what the EU is doing to: commit to proceeding on trade regulation under a specified time frame and unblock funds in aid regulation for northern Cyprus to disburse on: aquis harmonisation, the civil service reform, refurbishment of Famagusta port and financing of a census in the north; implement a new funding instrument for northern Cyprus and establish a branch office of the Commission delegation in the north to oversee the delivery of funds for technical assistance and acquis harmonisation; revise current proposals for direct trade to include incorporation of northern Cyprus into the EU Customs Union with Turkey, amend the Green Line regulation, and jointly manage the Famagusta port with the Turkish Cypriots and ensure that Turkish Cypriots are fairly represented within the EU institutions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, the Commission has started to implement the Council regulation that establishes an instrument of financial assistance for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community. That was adopted during the Austrian Presidency, on 27 February 2006. Our programme team responsible for the implementation of the regulation should be operational as of this month. It will use an EU programme support office in the northern part of Nicosia. The first projects envisaged for implementation encompass, inter alia, actions in the field of solid waste, energy, local infrastructure, business support and other very concrete measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, the Commission is also implementing an institution-building programme through the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange Instrument (TAIEX), in order to help prepare the Turkish Cypriot community for the future application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in that part of the island.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed Direct Trade Regulation submitted by the Commission to the Council in July 2004 – over two years ago – is still before the Council. The Commission supports efforts of the Finnish Presidency to secure a speedy adoption of this trade regulation in order to fulfil the EU’s commitment of April 2004. We have no intention of withdrawing the proposal and submitting a revised version. We have been and remain ready to accept and facilitate any accompanying measures that would support reunification and economic development and that are acceptable to both communities and all parties, in order to overcome the very unfortunate current stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a badly-kept secret that the accompanying measures have largely centred on the question of the Port of Famagusta. In reply to the question by Mr Matsis, the return of Varosha has been linked in the past to the UN-led talks on a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. Therefore it is up to the parties involved to decide whether to keep this issue within the framework of the comprehensive settlement or to discuss it separately or to find a way to include it in both concepts. Where there is a will there is a way. We now expect both communities to approach the matter by focusing less on past injustice and more on future solutions. We expect a constructive spirit from all parties. It is high time to end the division and reunify Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
