In order to prevent any repetition of these disasters, or at least to ensure that if they do occur the consequences are not so tragic, at the beginning of the year the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive seeking to establish minimum safety requirements for tunnels. The Commission also received encouragement for its approach through several resolutions adopted by your Parliament, specifically following the fire in the Gothard tunnel in October 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal targets all road tunnels over 500 metres long that form part of the trans-European network, totalling around 500 tunnels. Tunnels in the trans-European network are actually used by drivers of all nationalities and it appears that the consequences of fires can be considerably diminished if persons finding themselves in such situations have access to standard safety equipment and to homogenous information on the best attitude to adopt in order to protect themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal contains both technical and organisational requirements. Without listing all the measures, the most important ones can be summarised as follows: extremely long tunnels must have fully working equipment, in particular emergency exits and improved ventilation systems. Automatic fire detectors must be capable of informing tunnel users of any potential danger. The Commission also proposes that emergency signals with a uniform safety standard should be installed and should be easy to understand for all users. We believe that all the proposed technical measures are necessary. Some people have been surprised at the highly technical nature of the proposal but if you compare the measures envisaged for the technical regulations set by international courts, or at national level, you will realise that these are necessary in order to cover the essential aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">At the organisational level, roles and responsibilities will from now on be clearly divided between the main actors involved, who are: the administrative authority, the tunnel user and the person or body responsible for safety. These measures will apply to new tunnels, and also to existing tunnels, which will have to be brought up to standard in line with a timetable spread over ten to fifteen years. Member States that have more than the Community average number of tunnels in their territory will have a longer deadline for bringing their older tunnels into line with the directive. The task facing the engineers responsible for the safety of these tunnels in the Member States is a long one and the directive must be adopted as soon as possible. As a result of the meetings that we have already held with some of you, I know that we can count on you to reach rapid agreement with the Council on this dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although tunnels are among the safest parts of the European road network, accidents in tunnels often result in grave consequences, among which the psychological effects are not to be ignored. In tunnels, people feel shut in. The three major accidents in the Tauern, Mont Blanc and St Gotthard tunnels – to which the Commissioner has already referred – made the peculiar characteristics of accidents in tunnels tragically apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">When these accidents occurred, Parliament pressed the Commission to initiate action on tunnel safety. Some time elapsed before the Commission, at the beginning of this year, submitted its proposal for a directive on minimum requirements for the safety of tunnels in the trans-European road network. Let it be emphasised from the outset that this proposal by the Commission is a good one. Our amendments were an attempt at making it even better, and I believe that we succeeded in doing so by dint of cooperation with the Commission and good dialogue with the Council, which, working in parallel with us, agreed a few days ago on the content of its Common Position, which it is – or so I hear – keen to complete tomorrow. We can expect, at second reading, to come to very quick agreement on a common directive, aiming to make European road transport safer, and in the hope that we will do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, though, we cannot be satisfied with this outcome. Our joint proposal – as I would like to call it – still has an array of cosmetic blemishes and real defects. Let me start by pointing them out. Our text focuses on one partial aspect of the issue of tunnel safety. In essence, we are demanding high standards in building work and elsewhere, but it is equally important to make improvements to the way in which people use tunnels. There needs to be better general training of drivers, and there is a particular need for better-trained drivers of passenger and freight vehicles. Nor can we be content with improving the safety of tunnels that are part of the TENs, while taking no account of the other road tunnels. We must act as quickly as possible to incorporate into our system the candidate countries and the others that intend to join us, and, as there is more to Europe than the EU, countries such as Switzerland, Norway and others as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has held out to us the prospect of certain things being done in response to these points. To some extent, though, it is the jurisdiction situation that prevents us from using legislation to work towards what we need, so, together, we have a certain amount of persuading to do. The candidate countries and those Europeans who are not yet in the EU have already, this time round, participated very actively in our work, and we hope they will continue to do so. I will take it as read that our proposal’s good points largely speak for themselves, but there are a number of details to which I would nevertheless like to give special mention. We tried very hard to lay down clear lines of responsibility. We worked hard to achieve flexibility, so that the users of tunnels can enjoy a properly high level of safety without delay, particularly where tunnels are old and in need of repair. We also attached particular importance to the practicability of what we were proposing in very many individual cases, of which the particular problems of tunnels in cities may be taken as representative.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue whose importance has been particularly stressed to me back home has to do with the safety of disabled people. I hope that we have come to the right conclusion as to what they need, and we have made constructive efforts to ensure that they too, in the event of a calamity, can expect a minimum standard of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">My final task as rapporteur is a thankful one. I would like to thank the many people who have helped to achieve this outcome in which we all share: the Commission and its staff; the various partners in dialogue from the Member States, but also – even though I am repeating myself – from Switzerland and Norway, and the Members of all the groups in this House and their assistants. Last but not least, I would like to express my personal gratitude to the member of the Committee secretariat, Mr Haug, for his many hours of dedicated work. I hope that, at second reading, he will support us as efficiently as he has done to date, and that things will work together so that we have, as soon as possible, better laws on safety in European tunnels.</p>

Most of the amendments tabled by Mr Rack are intended on the one hand, to prescribe realistic safety standards for tunnels, and, on the other, to avoid the system for responsibility for implementation of common safety standards becoming too complicated and bureaucratic. I believe that he deserves particular credit for this.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rules on the safety of tunnels tend very much to have been drafted with the tunnels in the Alps and similar areas in mind, but would make for major problems with traffic flow in those tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network that run through towns and cities, we endorse the rapporteur’s proposal that the administrative authorities be empowered to grant derogations from the general regulations for special tunnels in urban areas, as the minimum intervals – of 100 metres between HGVs, for example – would result in substantial tailbacks and hence in greater damage to the environment in tunnels in cities, the tunnel under the Elbe in Hamburg being one example. Similar considerations apply in the case of the obligatory examination of HGVs equipped with additional tanks before they enter a tunnel, which, thank God, is to be dropped as a result of the rapporteur’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the demand that building work to improve the safety of tunnels should receive general financial support from the TENs budget, as such measures could well overstretch the financial resources of individual Member States, and as improved safety in tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network is in the interest of all citizens of the EU. If I may put that in more specific terms, Commissioner, most tunnels are situated in that lovely country, Italy, and if Italy were to bear alone the cost of making transport safe, it would make for a problem for us all. That being so, I believe it to be important that the Community should – Mr Swoboda is catching my eye at this point – use TENs funds to cover a share of the work on improving tunnels in those countries that have long ones, as the reason why we want to improve the tunnels that these countries provide – whether we are talking here about Austria, Italy or even Switzerland and France – is the safety of those who travel through them, who are not only Italians and Austrians, but also many Danes, Germans and people from the Netherlands. This means that this aspect of finance is one that we should particularly take into account. Again, though, many thanks, Mr Rack, for your outstanding report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by thanking Mr Jarzembowski for the way in which he acknowledges the great value of transit areas for Europe’s road users as a whole, in view of which I do not doubt that he will play a very active part in the Conciliation Committee when it considers the transit issue. Thank you for that! I wanted, of course, also to extend warm thanks to Mr Rack for his report and for the work he has done. It has indeed not been an easy task, but it has been a technical one, having much to do with the safety of our fellow citizens and with the protection of their lives and limbs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out how difficult it is to weigh in the balance maximum safety on the one hand and costs – which have to be affordable – on the other. If one were to look at this solely from the point of view of the safety of human beings, one would have to demand immediate rebuilding, with bi-directional tunnels and so on. If, though, one considers these things in relation to costs – which one also has to do – then a new middle way has to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">I agreed with the rapporteur that the rather stringent regulation that the Commission proposed was a good foundation. It became apparent, though, in the course of debates in the committee, as well as in discussions with the Council and, eventually, with the Commission, that some points might well call for a gentler approach, and so we came to a compromise, but one that takes account of the essential safety aspects. Mr Jarzembowski has already made reference to the special conditions that apply in cities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always attached great importance to the clear demarcation of responsibilities, so that there should be no lack of clarity about who is responsible for what in matters affecting the safety of tunnels. That is why the establishment of supervisory bodies and the appointment of a safety coordinator for each tunnel is so very important, for we can see that the principal problem with safety measures of this kind is that nobody really feels responsible. It is also important that rules for this should be laid down by the European Union and that we in the committee accepted the Commission’s proposals with only minor modifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view that we should, of course, not limit ourselves to building work, but that measures should also be taken to organise traffic. On that, I would have liked to see better account taken of several amendments, but it has to be clear to us from the outset that diversions, speed restrictions and rules on the intervals between vehicles are necessary in those places where they make sense and will not lead to serious traffic jams, as is professional training for drivers of heavy goods vehicles – for it is particularly in connection with the transport of hazardous loads that we have seen particularly serious accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as is stated in the motion, I take the view that the Member States will of course have to comply by doing this not only with reference to the trans-European networks, but also, and to an adequate degree, in the other tunnels and in the other parts of the road network. So let me reiterate my belief that this is a good report with a realistic approach, and say that I agree with the Commissioner that we and the Council need to come to a shared solution without delay. Once again, then, many thanks to the rapporteur for the work he has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markov (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having seen a wide variety of serious accidents in tunnels in the European Union’s road network, discussion of how to guarantee a high standard of safety throws up, yet again, the crucial question as to the extent to which the European Union should lay down detailed and specific technical rules, or, to put it another way, how much leeway there has to be for various ways of adapting to change. Mr Rack’s compromise is the right one, and for finding it he deserves our gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, nevertheless, have five comments to make. Firstly, and quite apart from all the flexibility involved in allocating tunnels to safety categories, it would have been desirable to lay down standardised indicators for assessing the safety of tunnels, which it might then have been sensible to use to analyse all the tunnels in the European Union, rather than only those forming part of the trans-European networks; this would have brought with it even greater added value in terms of improving safety. Such indicators would also make it possible to carry out a risk analysis or an evaluation of dangerous situations and accidents on the basis of common benchmarks. I therefore find it regrettable that the text no longer contains the Commission’s proposal on the standardised application of harmonised norms to working methods in conformity assessment bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the closely-connected question of whether it is right that the tunnel management should, as an organisation with its own functions, also be able to be the body that investigates accidents. I do not think it should, as one cannot exclude the possibility of conflicts of interest, which would be detrimental to the maintenance of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I fully support the new ruling that, where tunnels impinge upon the territory of two Member States, joint investigating bodies are to be set up to exercise the necessary functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it appears to me that, quite apart from the measures for which this report provides to impose minimum requirements for the safety of tunnels, there is a whole range of other actions that could help improve safety, and do so more simply and probably at less cost. In this I include what Mr Swoboda has already said about additional rules for tunnel users’ speed, the distance between their vehicles, the giving of particular signals, markings, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that all the technical measures that have been proposed can have little effect when a driver is over-tired. Modern technology notwithstanding, what is ultimately crucial in road transport, as in so many other areas of society, is the human factor. I would therefore like to call upon the Council – even though it is not represented here – to deliver a final position on the Regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport.</p>

And this time I am not referring to the French<span class="italic"> péage </span>or the German<span class="italic"> Maut</span>, but to the death and mutilation of people with a value as human beings that cannot be expressed in money terms. Every year, some 40 000 men and women die on our roads, the equivalent of two full jumbo jets crashing every week in the fifteen EU Member States. Annually, more than 200 000 people are scarred for life through injury and/or a handicap. Never do we in any way take note of these statistics. Last week, a delegation of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which I had the pleasure of chairing, visited two long tunnels with two-way traffic in the Alps. One of those was the Mont Blanc tunnel – 11.6 km long – where, in March 1999, a burning lorry caused an inferno, thereby claiming the lives of 39 people. Our visit started with a brief moment at the monument that was erected in memory of those victims. During the three years that this tunnel was subsequently closed, considerable investments have been made in a large number of facilities, which have been discussed in this report. Nevertheless, the sight of lorries passing each other in both directions on a total width of no more than seven metres is still a frightening one.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rack has rendered the proposal more effective without underestimating the seriousness of the risks. We therefore hope that the Commission is willing to recognise this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an expensive solution; construction of such tunnels initially claimed many lives, and it was until recently used only in exceptional circumstances. The nineteenth century saw the start of railway tunnels, to which were added, in the twentieth, tunnels for cars. Meanwhile, engineering is increasingly enabling us to build tunnels under cities, under protected areas of outstanding natural beauty and under sea straits. These days, tunnel piping is inserted even under flat land consisting of soft, waterlogged peaty soil, as is the case in the Netherlands. Not only are tunnels now used on a much broader scale than in the past, but they are also used much more often. As a result, there is a considerably greater risk of explosions, fires and of people being suffocated. Until the recent fires, starting with the one in the Mont Blanc tunnel, far too little attention was paid to these risks. Meanwhile, economic interests mean that two-way lorry traffic across busy roads in one tunnel pipe is still permitted. Where this traffic is halted temporarily, it meets with protests from those living in the vicinity when it is allowed to resume. On the basis of experience gathered to date, I have reached the conclusion that tunnels without separate lanes and without parallel escape tunnels are unsuitable for use by large numbers of cars and by heavy goods traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Roads offer individual drivers too much freedom for dangerous and deviant behaviour. Tunnels offer more options for rail traffic, but here too, escape routes are required. Moreover, it is likely that the two extremely long tunnels that will run under Switzerland, and the Brenner base tunnel, designed to run from Germany to Italy under Austria, will be suitable only for freight traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Markov, has already addressed the issues of supervision and cross-border tunnels. Whilst I unreservedly support proposals to improve emergency exits and to make them suitable for wheelchair users, or other measures to step up safety requirements, I do not consider them to be adequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Thuringia, the German province from which I come, the longest motorway tunnel in Germany was opened a few weeks ago. Even though it is also – as predicted beforehand, the safest – many drivers still find using it highly stressful.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission launched its draft directive on the improvement of safety in tunnels, I was, on the one hand, glad that it is fundamentally in accordance with the third action programme to improve road safety, which we had welcomed, but I was also concerned and disturbed by the prospect of an enormous increase in bureaucracy and of the high costs resulting from it, which, it appeared, would devolve upon the Member States. After all, tunnel routes were not and are not among the most dangerous or accident-prone stretches of road in our Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, my fears have been allayed, as the rapporteur – to whom let me now express my particular gratitude and appreciation – has managed after all to tighten up the draft directive, to further develop and restructure it, to make it less bureaucratic and its technical provisions more flexible. In this process, vitally significant safety aspects have not been disregarded; on the contrary, it has been possible to extend them, for example, by taking into account the safety needs of people with disabilities, which makes sense and is – and, I think, in view of this being the European Year of People with Disabilities – positively necessary. It remains to me to urge that this be speedily transposed into national law and to express the hope that it will have a tangible and positive effect on our road users, both in psychological and in real terms.</p>

<p class="contents">I am pleased to note, first of all, that there is a broad degree of consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the measures to be adopted. Differences of opinion, where they occur, only relate to aspects that are relatively minor in comparison with the aims that are being pursued here and which are: to achieve, within a decade, a substantial improvement in the level of protection provided for users of major trans-European road network tunnels.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Rack’s report, I should like, Mr President and Mr Rack, not to go through the 78 amendments one by one, but to divide them into groups. Parliament has been given a set of highly technical amendments which are intended, if I am not mistaken, to bring the Commission’s proposal more into line with the text that has resulted from the work of the Council, which has itself held many meetings with experts on this issue. In principle, the Commission has no major objection to these amendments because we feel we have endeavoured to prevent the Council from deviating from the proposal’s original intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also wishes to highlight several amendments that pay specific attention to persons with disabilities, to ensure that they are able to escape in the event of a fire. We are, in principle, in favour of the directive making specific reference to disabled people. The experts tell us that, in the event of major fires that cannot be put out, users have only a very short time <span class="bold">–</span> around ten minutes <span class="bold">–</span> in which to reach shelter. Unfortunately, therefore, persons in wheelchairs, who move more slowly, are at greater risk than able-bodied people. We believe that all of the directive’s provisions will lead to considerable improvements to the protection of the disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments are intended to modify the terminology used in order to designate the various levels for which clarification of responsibilities is sought. The Commission does not wish to accept these amendments, because moving away from terminology which now appears to be almost universally accepted would not help us to achieve our goal of clarification. Some amendments relate to aspects not covered by the directive but which are important for tunnel safety or for implementing measures. I am thinking in particular of the amendments relating to driver training or to the financing of tunnel repairs. Although these are only simple recitals, they fall outside the scope of the directive and we do not feel able to accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, when you add them up, the Commission can accept totally or in principle 52 amendments; it can accept one other in part and there are 25 amendments that it cannot accept. These somewhat stark figures are not an accurate reflection of the real situation, which is that between the Commission and Parliament, and I think I can say between Parliament and the Council, there is greater agreement than the figures suggest on the essential aspects of the dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to express the hope that the three institutions manage to take a decision so that the directive can be adopted rapidly. As I said, the engineers face a long haul in order to bring the tunnels into line with the provisions of the directive and this work must be begun as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
