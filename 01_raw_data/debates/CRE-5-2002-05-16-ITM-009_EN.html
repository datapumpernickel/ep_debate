<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tannock (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we are here to express our concern at the recent outbreak of inter-communal violence that has erupted in the Indian State of Gujarat – violence which has claimed hundreds of lives and left thousands homeless and destitute. I am sure that Parliament will join me in expressing condolences and profound sympathy to the members of both communities who have suffered loss and bereavement, including relatives of my own London constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some history to the inter-communal violence in Gujarat including, it must be said, persecution of Christians by Hindu extremists. The latest outbreak began after Muslim extremists killed 58 Hindu pilgrims on a train near Godhra – a deeply callous act which unleashed a round of reprisals and counter-reprisals. This chain of events has generated considerable soul-searching in India itself, a country founded on the rule of law and secular democracy, with accusations that the State authorities did not react quickly enough to the scale of events.</p>
<p class="contents">No system of government is perfect, but since the army was called in, 30 thousand arrests have been made, with 80% of those arrested being Hindus. In addition, it is significant that the violence did not spread to other parts of India and large areas of Gujerat itself remained calm. In the Indian Parliament, the government accepted the Congress Party opposition's motion as the basis for discussion with cross-party support, reaffirming its belief in democratic pluralism and respect for minorities in a giant country of over a billion people of diverse backgrounds and race, and the independent Justice Verma commission is now reporting back to the government.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly lessons have to be learned, but we should not forget that India is currently reeling from a series of atrocious terrorist attacks by Islamic Jihadi extremists – most recently the killing of 30 people, including women and children, and scores of wounded on the outskirts of Jammu. This attack makes the dangerous threat of war more likely between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, a country which regrettably and, until recently, actively supported Islamic terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must urgently do everything possible to prevent any further escalation of violence which might threaten global peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The influence of events in building tension in that atmosphere is also very concerning, as it shows that this is not an entirely spontaneous phenomenon or simply the result of clashes, but that in many cases it is being orchestrated to hide the real social problems affecting people. We have to take account of the atmosphere of high tension and violence that we are experiencing and which I believe has increased since 11 September, and the supposed clash of civilisations, with the war in Afghanistan and everything that goes with it, because that shows that we are seeing the consequences of the process that we call ‘globalisation’, which is gradually increasing inequalities and tension, and as a result, confrontations arise between communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the European Union should, as the Commissioner said, pay attention to these phenomena and increase its efforts, not only looking to the places concerned but also to the United Nations in order to deal with all aspects of the problem. These types of acts are going to increase and we, the European Union, as an international body, have a great responsibility and the capacity to act, not only with financial aid, but, as I said earlier, by changing the effects and the process of globalisation, which is affecting so many peoples across the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Needless to say, this is a very important matter that has to be considered in the light of the significance that India represents, not only in Asia, but also in the rest of the world. After all, we should not forget that India is not only a superpower that has great economic potential, it is also a country that has nuclear capacity. All credit to the common resolution for not having succumbed to radical opinions. After all, it should be clear to everyone that India is certainly not experiencing a clash of civilisations. It should be emphasised that Muslims have largely been integrated in Indian society. A concrete example of this so-called multicultural society is the fact that Muslims occupy high government offices. This, however, does not detract from the fact that I deeply regret what happened in Gujarat. I would, however, note that the incidents in Gujarat did not spread to the rest of India. This is, in my view, proof that the Hindu-Muslim coalition is still respecting democratic values. On the other hand, we need to be concerned about the increase in Muslim fundamentalism that is a daily occurrence in Kashmir. The day before yesterday, an attack on an Indian army camp claimed 9 victims. Extremist militia of Muslim activists who demand union with Pakistan are very active here. Last Tuesday, there were already 32 casualties in an Indian army camp too. This time, Indian women and children went into hiding. These incidents must, further to this resolution, also be brought to the attention of the international community. This tragic incident underlines once again the enormous threat which growing terrorism poses. I take the view that the European Union and the European Parliament have every interest in continuing the support India as a constitutional state, where Hindus and Muslims are treated equally, in their endeavours to respect the democratic principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, although I appear on the list as an author, my group is not a signatory to this joint resolution, although we are likely to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">As previous speakers have said, probably none of us in this Chamber would deny the devastating effects of religious extremism. In the case of Gujarat, as Mr Tannock mentioned, it is actually Hindu extremism. It was the action of those so-called "pilgrims" which resulted in an appalling massacre of 58 people. We have seen the fallout from that in what is euphemistically called "inter-communal violence".</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution states that whereas numerous independent inquiries by human rights organisations confirm that state officials and the police of Gujarat were involved in the clashes, this involvement runs deep. It is not just a question of a casual street brawl but orchestrated violence and intimidation over a sustained period.</p>
<p class="contents">The Human Rights Watch report states that the Gujarat Government chose to characterise the violence as a spontaneous reaction to the incidents at Godhra. Human Rights Watch findings and those of numerous Indian human rights and civil liberties organisations and most of the Indian press indicate that the attacks on Muslims throughout the state were planned well in advance of the Godhra incident and organised with extensive police participation and in close cooperation with officials of the BJP State Government.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 April India's national Human Rights Commission released the preliminary findings of its report on the violence, a strong indictment of the failure of the Gujarat Government to contain the violence. The very authorities to whom people should have been able to look for protection were, in many cases, complicit in devastating attacks and increasing the level and ferocity of violence which makes every citizen feel threatened, whatever their religion or background.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now about 100 refugee camps organised by NGOs in the area. A mere handful see support from the government of Gujarat State. That authority has a responsibility for the wellbeing and care of these people now and in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Indian Government has an overall responsibility to see that justice is done and that the instigators, organisers and perpetrators of this violence are brought to justice. They will also need to ensure that the police force in Gujarat is made to recognise that it owes a duty to all people who may be under threat or attack, not just their own.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear signals are needed from the government – indeed we have had some – that religious intolerance and incitement to religious hatred have no place in secular, democratic India. My group welcomes the ruling of the Indian Supreme Court in March this year banning any religious ceremonies at Ayodhya until the definite legal settlement of the case which we hope will be in the interests of a peaceful, long-term solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carrilho (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, first of all, I do not think this emergency resolution is the best way to help solve the still worrying situation in Gujarat, mainly because the violence seen in this state during recent months is a manifestation of an extremely complex phenomenon affecting the whole region and not just India. It involves social factors such as poverty, urban ‘ghettoisation’, some interference by organised crime with unknown links abroad, a certain inability of the political elite to mobilise people’s energies around political ideals and the drift towards the religious sphere, especially through fundamentalist extremism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, quite right that the European Parliament should feel concern for a case that has already cost the lives of a about thousand people – or even more, as estimates vary according to the source. This is not the time to analyse the episodes that gave rise to this violence, but it is worth pointing out that everything began with the fire in two train carriages on 27 February last, in which 58 people died, half of them women and children. Nothing can justify this kind of action, and the retaliations and revenge that followed cannot be justified at all, either. Godhra, it should be remembered, is a peripheral urban area with a high population density and a level of latent social conflict, where the forces of law and order generally find it difficult to act, apart from the possible involvement of members of the local police in one or other religious faction, according to the results of inquiries so far.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certain is that at first the forces of law and order did not succeed in putting an end to the violence. The matter was, however, taken up immediately by the democratic institutions of the Indian Union, namely the government, the opposition parties and parliament. I did in fact visit the Indian Parliament on the very days when this subject was discussed. Urgent measures were adopted not only on the government’s own initiative but also because of strong pressure from the opposition and the Indian media. I must point out that stands adopted outside the Indian democratic system itself, however well intentioned they may be, sometimes end up being counterproductive in that they bolster nationalist and fundamentalist positions of various origins, Islamic or Hindu. In any case, on behalf of my group, I recommend adoption of this resolution without any changes, as we consider it well balanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now violence has erupted in Gujarat, where murders, massacres and burnings alive by both sides have claimed around 1500 victims since February this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hindu nationalist parties justify their radicalism by referring to the spread of Islam in neighbour states and its influence on India. The Indian Supreme Court's ruling of 13 March gives cause to hope that the violence will end. The Court ruled that the land on which Hindu fanatics tore down a mosque to build a temple in 1992 may not be handed over to the radical Hindu organisation WHP. Constitutional guarantees, such as the Muslim marriage law which upholds the traditions of Indian Muslims, are an expression of India's religious freedom and freedom of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secularism is enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution of India. Article 25, which guarantees the freedom to practise and propagate a religion, also imposes an obligation on the Indian State to protect all its citizens. The ideal of peaceful co-existence between different ethnic communities and cultures is upheld as a principle. The Indian Government has deployed a number of units of the army in an attempt to send out a clear signal to the world community that it is willing to end the violence. It has also offered the relatives of the victims the prospect of an aid package amounting to around EUR 35 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The international criticism of many of the completely inadequate measures taken to deal with the radical movements has been acknowledged by the Indian Justice Minister in recent days, especially since India signed international human rights agreements a long time ago. The PPE-DE Group believes that such insights should set a precedent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mahatma Gandhi led the Indians with a message of non violence, tolerance, and overcoming religious differences, in an epic campaign that has remained among the most symbolic victories of peaceful methods in politics, as it established the most populated democracy in the world and a society considered to be a model of co-existence of races, languages and, in short, of civilisations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, conflicts based on religious fanaticism have never stopped occurring in India. Although one of the most significant victims of those conflicts was Gandhi himself, the list continued with other assassinations, such as that of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, her son, also Prime Minister, and others. And as well as those people whom we know as important figures, thousands of innocent people have fallen victim to intransigence and fanaticism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a paradox that it is precisely where the material and social needs are greatest that religious extremism and intolerance arises and builds up. We are talking about a country where the inequalities are devastating and where the physical environment and natural disasters often make life even more difficult for the people, and it is there that conflicts between the followers of majority beliefs and other smaller communities have permanently marked and tarnished the history of the greatest democracy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must ask the Government of India to guarantee the safety of its people with the same amount of effort that it is making with other challenges of development in which it is achieving significant success. The Indian Government must maintain its efforts by dedicating sufficient resources to enable people who have been displaced to return to their place of origin and to re-establish harmony in Gujarat and other areas affected by the recent clashes that led to our debate, and they must also purge the cases of collusion by the security forces in episodes of religious and political violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must support these efforts and urgently send as much aid as possible to the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is hardly surprising then that we are now reaping a hurricane.</p>
<p class="contents">These unbelievable and, as Mrs Lambert has just demonstrated, logical reversals are the same as those which we – or rather you – applied to Palestine: the fact that Mr Sharon visited the esplanade of the mosques or Temple Mount was justification enough for attacks by suicide bombers who are in fact nothing less than suicide murderers. Today, the fact that 60 pilgrims were burnt is justification and excuse enough for the violence unleashed on them by the Muslims.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that all this is the result of this inability, this democratic relativism spreading throughout Europe which prevents us from getting to the root of problems, which prevents us from remembering that, with 1 billion inhabitants, India is the largest democracy in the world, which prevents us from realising that, by going to Beijing rather than to Delhi, we are encouraging dictatorship, that by supplying arms to Pakistan for 40, maybe 50 years, we are strengthening the dictatorship, that by doing what we have done to the Taliban regime or by not doing what we should have done, we generated a tragedy in Afghanistan, especially for its women.</p>
<p class="contents">This has slowly been building up to the events we are witnessing today and I think that, even if we can reproach the Indian authorities on a number of counts, we need to get beyond these reproaches. I think we also need to look at the exemplary manner in which this huge country has reacted; federal armed forces have been sent to Gujarat, a committee of inquiry has been set up and recourse has been taken to the Supreme Court, all fundamental reactions on the part of India despite its development problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that if there is a problem, Mr Marset Campos, it is not globalisation but the lack of globalisation. There is still a special unit within the Commission – I do not know if Commissioner Nielson can confirm this – which ensures that Indian textiles do not enter the territory of the European Union. Now, as everyone knows, textiles are one of the sectors around which India can develop and create a stronger economy. Over the last ten years, since globalisation began, India has had a rate of growth of 6 to 7%. That was certainly not the case before globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">So long live globalisation, but long live globalisation in both directions! We cannot expect to keep on exporting our products to India while stopping imports of Indian products into our countries. This is how to achieve development, this is how to strengthen democracy in India and perhaps also closer to home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like the diplomatic missions of several Member States, the Commission Delegation in New Delhi sent a fact-finding mission to Gujarat to assess the situation on the ground. The Commission has a significant cooperation programme in Gujarat of more than EUR 100 million. I was there in January meeting the state government, inspecting the devastation after the earthquake a year before and trying to accelerate our reconstruction activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The mission I am talking about was different and more problematical because of its background, but it was necessary to send a mission to Gujarat to assess whether the riots had implications for the principles on which our cooperation is based, including respect for human rights and democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings were deeply worrying. Violence was not only widespread, but in many cases extreme brutality was used. Unofficial figures set the death toll at 2000, most of them Muslims. The mission also heard accusations from the Indian media and the Indian Human Rights Commission that the Gujarat state authorities had been complacent in their handling of the Hindu rioters.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with India's healthy and vigorous democratic tradition, a lively debate has been going on in the country about the consequences of the events in Gujarat and the responsibilities of the government at state and national level. I am confident that India's commitment to democracy and the rule of law will ensure that those who were responsible for these atrocities will be held to account, and that the victims will be provided with relief. The central government and the state government have already taken steps in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Both in Delhi and in Madrid, the EU troika has raised our concerns about the crisis with the Government of India, and the Commission has participated in these démarches. From a humanitarian point of view, the Commission is currently examining the possibility of giving humanitarian assistance to the victims of the riots through ECHO. A decision on this is expected within the next two weeks. The honourable Members will, of course, be informed immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
