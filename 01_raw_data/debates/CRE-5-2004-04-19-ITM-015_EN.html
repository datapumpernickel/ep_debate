<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I regret the late hour for the debate on this topic which is actually going to affect the lives of many of our citizens, but the core group of the 'friends of Regulation 1408' are still here and recognise its importance.</p>
<p class="contents">This piece of work on the coordination – not harmonisation, as some of my colleagues would like us to believe – of social security systems has been lengthy. It started life in the previous Parliament and then changed to codecision and unanimity in Council in 1999. I trust that this simplification and modernisation of the much-amended regulation in the past will provide a useful and very constructive framework in a further enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank sincerely all the shadow rapporteurs and other Members for their serious work and ultimately constructive approach to this regulation. I also want to record my thanks to the Commission for its willingness to support our work with time, information and explanation. In Council, too, we have seen an increasing willingness to approach this reform with some spirit, which I know was not shared by all Members back in 1999 when I first met with representatives and Member States in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind Members that Council informed the chairman and members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – in writing in a letter dated 31 March and indeed verbally after that – of its agreement to the amendments here proposed to the common position and to the Council statement on taxation to be entered in the Council minutes should agreement be reached on the adoption of the regulation. I trust that tomorrow we will confirm the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at its last meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the restrictions concerning this regulation have caused us some problems: the fact that tax cannot be tackled within it raises particular problems for some cross-border workers, especially as we see tax and social protection systems increasingly interlocking in some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we cannot build bridges between systems means that some people will still feel that free movement is not sufficiently supported and that will mean at least more work for the Committee on Petitions. However, mutual recognition, whether for family status or status as a person with disabilities, for example, will also continue to be an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recognise in Parliament that we have not achieved the full flexibility we had hoped for with regard to access to benefits in kind for frontier workers and their families. While we realise that the fact that Member States must now explicitly register in Annex 3 if they do not wish to provide such a service demonstrates that this is a deviation from the norm, we view such refusals with concern. I am sure that this is an issue which will be taken up in the next Parliament when we see the Commission's proposals for the currently empty Annexes 2, 10 and 11, and for the implementing regulation. We trust that work will progress as speedily as possible so that the full revised proposal may come into force within the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we believe that the common position as amended in committee is a positive step forward. There has been no regression on the status quo: all persons covered by social security schemes are now included – not just paid workers. The positive steps taken for third country nationals – Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report – are also there and were in the original Commission proposal. There is greater clarity concerning cross-border healthcare, and the European Court of Justice decisions on the criteria concerning medical necessity are there. The adoption of the assimilation of facts and events will be of benefit to frontier workers in particular and the number of derogations and exceptions has been reduced, despite our concern about the future development of the Annexes. There are clear criteria now concerning special non-contributory cash benefits. The principle of good administration has also been introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a complex but necessary piece of work and it helps to answer the question of what the European Parliament does to benefit people. Despite certain reservations, which many of us in the House feel, I commend the common position, as amended, to the House and wish future rapporteurs on the subject the same degree of support and interest that has been offered to me as your rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in a strange sort of way, I found this challenging and interesting experience quite fun at times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Achieving the objective of official approval by the Council and by Parliament before the 1 May is of the greatest importance, for numerous reasons. The most important is that it will send out a clear message to the citizens in both the present and in the new Member States, demonstrating that the European Union is both willing and able to set appropriate conditions for the real free movement of persons, the cornerstone of which is the coordination of social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, on her truly excellent report on such a technically difficult issue as the coordination of social security systems. I should also like to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its work.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European Commission, in the amended proposal which it submitted last October, took account in full or in part of most of the amendments approved by Parliament at first reading. As regards the two amendments within the framework of the second reading, they clearly improve the quality of the text and the Commission can therefore accept them in full.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I can assure you that the Commission is also in a position to accept some of the remaining concerns and considerations expressed by certain members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at second reading, within the framework of the proposal for a new executive regulation which the Commission will submit by the end of this year. I hope, as Mrs Lambert also said, that both the regulation and the three annexes will be approved by 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position of the Council responds to the main objectives of the Commission proposal, which entail simplifying and improving the coordination of social security systems, for the benefit of European citizens moving around within the Union. The simplification and modernisation of the present regulation are the basic <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to the promotion of the mobility of labour in the Union. They are therefore closely connected with the general objective of competitiveness, of more and better jobs and of social cohesion. It is a fact that the present regulation provides protection in the social security sector for persons moving for any reason – personal or professional – from one Member State to another. It is therefore important to the overwhelming majority of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to enumerate all the improvements which the new rules will bring about compared with the present regulation, but we can focus our attention very briefly on three issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules will apply to all citizens in the European Union covered by a Member State's social security system. The application of the coordination rules to all insured persons will satisfy the need for Regulation No 1408 to be brought into line with developments in the freedom of movement within the European Union, which is not just a right for workers, but is also a reality for all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules will strengthen the principle of equal treatment of nationals of the European Union by introducing a provision governing the cross-border recognition of facts and incidents. This provision is particularly important for cross-border workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The current regulation does not contain clear provisions on good administration. The new rules remedy this shortcoming. These rules in fact require increased cooperation and mutual assistance between the agencies in the Member States for the benefit of citizens. In addition, agencies will be required to reply within a reasonable period of time to all questions and to provide citizens with any information requested in order to exercise their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that this was indeed a long and difficult procedure which is coming to a successful end and I must thank you once again for bringing such a laborious task to a speedy conclusion in your capacity as joint legislator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wanted more and better proposals on a number of scores. Nevertheless, I have noticed that a number of important achievements have been made, and I would thank Commissioner Dimas for his responses.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation that is before us applies to all EU citizens. That is progress. I have noticed that it has not only been expanded in terms of scope, it has also been simplified. That too is progress. I gather that on paper, a clear distinction has been drawn between the exportability and non-exportability of cash benefits. Furthermore, I think that problems could well occur when the annexes are further detailed. I still regret the way in which, last time, Mrs Gillig and her Socialist colleagues refused even to bring this point to a vote in a democratic manner. I therefore fear that we will have problems when the annexes are fleshed out.</p>
<p class="contents">There are major improvements in this regulation for frontier workers. I can see the legal implications of what has now been established. For example, certain events in a Member State must be treated in the same way by the country of residence as similar events that have taken place on their own territory. That is progress. I have also noticed that the position of the family members of frontier workers has, in fact, been turned round and that they now have rights too. In an annex, however, those self-same rights are being nullified, so the progress made in the regulation is invalidated in the annex.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the feeling that we could have achieved more had we consulted all protocols, for example, in the field of tax levies and social premium levies. I know that the Council is against it, but we could have kept this all together. I can see that, in a number of respects, the Court of Justice’s judgments have been much more clearly incorporated into this regulation. I also gather that the Court’s health-care decrees have been assimilated effectively. I do have a problem, though, with the way in which outpatient care has been treated, in contrast with what the Court states. In addition, unemployment has been better highlighted, although to a lesser extent than I had expected. Third-country citizens are now included, but my report had already proposed that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have recommended that my group should vote in favour, on the condition that I am given every opportunity of introducing improvements where possible when the introductory regulation is fleshed out and also in the annexes. I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate all those involved, particularly Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Cornelissen and his team, the Irish Presidency and a number of previous presidencies on this achievement. My group considers this to be a sound basis, and also sets great store by the fact that it is ensured that the first step will be ready, as a matter of priority, by 1 May.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we are not completely ready, nor are we 100% satisfied. During the new legislative period too, with 25 Member States, it will still be of the utmost importance that we should cast a critical eye on the way in which the annexes are fleshed out, as well as the development of the implementing regulation. In this respect, we should not only examine the system, for which the basis has now been laid, but also the consequences of the changes which ensue from it, because some people can be seriously let down by this. We need to seek out solutions to these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are problems that cannot be solved in the regulation itself, some of which have already been mentioned, including the linking of taxes to social security systems or systems with which social security systems are complemented through collective labour agreements in private-sector industry. These are points mainly affecting frontier workers.</p>
<p class="contents">On various occasions, we in this House have called for a frontier work test, for changes in national rules and for a much better, structured cooperation between Member States where frontier work is a frequent occurrence. Accordingly, I should like to urge the Dutch Presidency at this stage to set to work in this respect in the next half year, as soon as the review is complete. The Netherlands, along with its neighbouring countries Germany and Belgium, should set an example for the other Member States in areas in which a great deal of bilateral negotiation is yet to take place, and the Netherlands should, if possible, also produce more ambitious cooperation agreements for the 25 Member States, because it is to be expected that labour migration will intensify.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressure of time prevents me from repeating all the points, but I should in any case like to suggest that cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission should continue, on the same footing and in a constructive manner. This could quite possibly be in the context of a special working party, the name of which Mrs Lambert has already suggested: The Friends of 1408. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that he shares our view that mobility in the Member States is more than necessary if we want to implement the Lisbon agenda. The Lambert report and Regulation 1408/71, on which the report is based, are, of course, important instruments in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely anxious about the wariness displayed by Member States with regard to the implications in terms of their own tax and social security systems. Here, I think, it is worth giving them a push in the right direction in future. That does not necessarily mean that you need to get Parliament’s backing, but mainly that you do need it from the Member States. I should nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved. Tomorrow, my group will be voting in favour of the Lambert report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I have a great deal of admiration for Mrs Lambert. This regulation contains some valid points. The definition of frontier workers has been adopted; there are improvements in the field of pensions and also the families of frontier workers have not been overlooked. However, that is not all. For example, my country, the Netherlands, has yet again asked for an opt-out in certain sections, one being the medical treatment of frontier workers’ families. We have provided for this in the regulation, but the Netherlands has still asked for an opt-out. I see that as being unacceptable. I think that you should always be the first one to tell your country that it is acting unwisely. That, of course, also applies to other countries that are extremely anxious that, upon the EU’s imminent enlargement, a heavy burden will be placed on their social security.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, I hope that we can, together, realise the ideal of mobility among Member States being promoted, and that first-generation frontier workers will be compensated accordingly and do not always have to fight for their rights. I gather that the President considers I have exceeded my speaking time, but I should very much like to have a good long talk with the new Commissioner about how we could bring this subject into the open more effectively. In my view, this needs a permanent monitoring committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One thing this highlights is that great results can be achieved when the EU institutions pool their collective intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has shown great tenacity in steering a very difficult course between many different viewpoints, and has arrived the best possible solution. I hope all Members will support this report tomorrow, along with the two amendments in it, as we need a majority vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In presenting this regulation to the public we should also highlight that this is probably the single most important piece of social legislation to come out of this Parliament and one that makes a real difference to people's lives in that it reflects the realities in which the modern-day European Union citizen is working. People are moving across borders to take up jobs, some people are retiring to other areas and an increasing number of people are working for periods in other Member States. We need to ensure that the rights of such people can be carried across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Great credit is due to the Council for taking on board so many of the amendments Parliament sought to bring forward after first reading. To be parochial, I wish to thank the Irish Permanent Representation for their tremendous work. A number of those colleagues, who are sitting on the far side of this House, are a credit to Ireland and their to department for all the work they have done on this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are one or two points of concern. Some of them have been dealt with, but I would like to re-emphasise them. The issue of taxation is an issue for Member States alone. It is not an issue that we should link with other matters because that merely diverts attention away from where the real work can be done. I agree with the rapporteur that this report is not about harmonisation; it is about better coordination of the social security systems in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation represents a huge change. Where previous regulations applied only to those who were economically active, this one applies to all benefit holders. It also constitutes an improvement as regards strengthening the equal treatment of all EU nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">There remains the issue of the 'empty Annexes'. We insist that the Commission and Council come forward in the near future with a proposal concerning the implemented regulation to ensure that the legitimate and genuine concerns raised by my colleagues – and in particular by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten – are taken on board and dealt with. Mrs Oomen-Ruijten brought forward issues that relate not to abstract numbers or abstract individuals, but to real people who encounter this kind of discrimination every day. It is now up to the Commission and Council, on the basis of the good faith we will show tomorrow, to keep their part of the bargain and bring forward a proposal in this regard. They must be as good as their word and ensure that those empty Annexes are filled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something that we can be pleased about, even though I do share the reservations which other Members have expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a technical and complex issue. Dealing with it has required a great deal of time, and the task is not finished even now. We have just been reminded that the annexes are empty, and we still have some work ahead of us. However, I should like to thank, also on behalf of my colleague, first of all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for her perseverance and determination. I should also like to pay tribute to all those who have assisted with this work, whether in the Commission or in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, overall, we can feel satisfied, we ought nonetheless to admit that margins for improvement are both possible and necessary on this subject. I should like to concentrate on the issue of the tools at our disposal for dealing with this matter. We need to go beyond the reservations and attitudes of those Member States who seek to preserve prerogatives which, in this context, look very much like protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the coordination principle, which basically restricts and constrains us, and does not allow us to respond to the questions put by Members, will soon give way to real harmonisation on social protection, which is one of the essential components of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced, Madam President, that the demand expressed by European citizens for a real social Europe, which we shall all be hearing a lot about in the near future, requires significant institutional change. The progress which has been made is to be welcomed. It is considerable, but it is still modest in comparison with what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and above all, it must not be allowed to mask the existing disparity, which is to be condemned, between the very effective procedures which we have at our disposal with regard to economic matters, and the much weaker procedures which are used in the social sphere. Social convergence criteria are essential in order to deal correctly with the subject of social protection linked to mobility in Europe, a subject which, to the citizens of Europe, forms the basis of the credibility of European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
