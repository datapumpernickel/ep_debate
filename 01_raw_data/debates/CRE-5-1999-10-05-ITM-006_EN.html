<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ALTENER is part of a multiannual programme of measures in the field of energy policy for the period 1998-2002. It is concerned with the important aspect of alternative, renewable energy sources. The Commission’s proposal dates from November 1997. At the first reading in March 1999, the last Parliament adopted its position on the basis of the draft report by our former colleague, Carlos Robles Piquer.</p>
<p class="contents">With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the legal basis has changed. The multiannual energy programme now falls under the codecision procedure. On 21 May 1999 – on the basis of the new legal position and directly after the Treaty of Amsterdam had come into force – the European Commission fundamentally altered and revised its proposal on the basis of Parliament’s decisions of 11 March 1999. On 28 June, the Council adopted its common position. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we can see that both the Commission and the Council have, to a large extent, accepted our proposals, and speaking here as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, I should therefore like to say a sincere thank you for the constructive cooperation in this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">At this second reading, Parliament now has to examine whether the common position requires further amendment. On 22 September, the Committee on Industry and Energy unanimously adopted a recommendation on this. It is a shared goal of Parliament and the Commission to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources to 12% of gross energy consumption within the Community by the year 2010. That is approximately double the present figure. This is an ambitious goal requiring considerable efforts. The compromises which have now been reached are only a step along this road. Parliament is convinced that it is necessary for the Member States in particular to make increased efforts. The resources we have for the ALTENER programme are so modest that this ambitious goal cannot be achieved. </p>
<p class="contents">The amendments we have tabled – nine in all – call on the Member States to make a voluntary commitment to promote renewable sources of energy. A charter should be used to overcome the fact that the European Union Treaty does not contain a specific chapter on energy policy. What is more, Parliament wants to include in Article 1, paragraph 1 implementation of the campaign to promote renewable sources of energy already called for by the 1997 White Paper. It also wants to create new instruments and mechanisms to promote rapid and coordinated penetration of the market by all sustainable energy technologies. In addition, the Eastern and Central European States and, as the Liberal Group has rightly requested, the Mediterranean States should also play an important role in implementation. </p>
<p class="contents">In Article 5 of the ALTENER programme, Parliament would also like to insert a reference to the new procedures for exercising powers of implementation in order to improve the participation of the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that part IV of the programme of several years’ duration consisting of measures in the field of energy policy cannot fulfil everyone’s wishes. In this connection, I should remind you of the second report being discussed today: the report by Mrs Ahern on energy efficiency. I should, however, also remind you that, in implementing alternative sources of energy, we have two major examples, namely water and wind power, which are already proportionately so important that the others, such as solar energy and also utilisation of biomass, will have to be promoted extremely intensively. I am very grateful and happy that you, Commissioner, now have responsibility for this important subject for, as a former Spanish Minister for Agriculture, you know that it is possibly much more sensible to reduce the surpluses achieved in the context of European agricultural policy than to make areas available for cultivation which could be exploited for utilising energy from biomass. I am aware, however, that there is quite a lot of resistance in this area and that we are encountering opposition from industry and also from those who formulate agricultural policy. We should all be striving, however, to combine agricultural and energy policy in the sphere of renewable energy sources. With this in mind, I should like to say a warm thank you for your valuable cooperation and hope that the report will be accepted by a majority in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rothe (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I should first of all like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for presenting a really good report. We in the Committee have gone along to the greatest possible degree – in fact, unanimously – with the proposal to again take up important requests for changes which arose out of the first reading and which have not been taken into account by the Council although we were very happy – and I say this here too, Mr Langen – that extensive approaches to Parliament were made. </p>
<p class="contents">It is a declared goal of the European Union to double the proportion of renewable sources of energy consumed by the year 2010. Parliament and the Commission were already in agreement on this in the debate on the Green and White Papers. The Council too has supported their stance in the common position we have before us. Although it is clear that the technical potential available from wind power and solar energy, from biomass, from water power and from geothermal energy could cover considerably more than 12% of energy consumption by 2010, we know that achieving just this 12% will require great efforts, judging by growth rates in the past. </p>
<p class="contents">This means that the Member States must do their homework. It also means that the European Union must make greater headway than in the past. For this to happen, it is necessary, on the one hand, to facilitate fair access to the grid for electricity from renewable energy sources. I would point out to the Commissioner that Parliament awaits the relevant proposals which must be such as to contribute to real market penetration. The close connection between conditions of access to the grid and growth rates in the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources is something we can see from the above-average rates of increase in Denmark, Germany and also Spain. </p>
<p class="contents">But what we are concerned with today is the ALTENER programme. It is the only EU programme which alone has the promotion of renewable energy sources as its goal. This programme is also the main instrument for implementing the Community strategy for renewable energy sources and it is therefore also the main instrument of the breakthrough campaign for renewable sources of energy. By means of this campaign, we want to introduce photovoltaic systems with a maximum output of one million kilowatts within the European Union and in developing countries. Among other things, 15 million square metres of solar collectors are to be erected. 10,000 megawatts are to be obtained from wind power and a further 10,000 megawatts from biomass. This campaign has to be financed from resources of the Member States, privately and with European funds. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had earmarked the amount of EUR 81.1 million for the four-year period from 1998 to 2002 in the ALTENER programme. According to the Commission’s estimates, the breakthrough campaign alone requires public financing to the tune of approximately EUR 7 billion by the year 2003. That is to say, EUR 7 billion which has to come from the Member States and from the European Union. We know that this 81.1 million would only be a drop in the ocean, but we cannot, under any circumstances, accept that this sum should again be reduced to EUR 74 million, as specified in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to endorse this position of the Committee, which has been unanimously adopted, in tomorrow’s vote and to also ensure that corresponding decisions are taken in the budget votes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union cannot meet its environmental targets unless the use of renewable energy sources is actively increased.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALTENER programme is an important part of the strategy to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. Renewable energy sources reduce the dependence on imported energy and an increase in their use will also improve competitiveness. Europe must attain a leading position in the rapidly growing area of the economy which is based on new technology for renewable energy sources. We must also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive effect on regional development and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALTENER programme is a step in the right direction. Mr Langen’s amendments also received broad-based unanimous support in the committee, which is no everyday occurrence. This consensus is a good starting point for promoting the use of sources of renewable energy. As has been stated here, however, this programme alone is by no means sufficient. An increase in the long-term use of renewable energy sources still requires a lot of research, pilot studies, an exchange of results, the harmonisation of legislation, a change in attitudes, information campaigns and also private and public investment which will pay for itself, but only in the long term. The sums used to finance the ALTENER programme are paltry considering the scale of the undertaking. In future we will need to investigate how we can increase investment in the greater use of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, increasing the use of renewable energy sources is mainly the responsibility of the Member States. Hopefully, this programme will encourage the Member States to act decisively in increasing the use of renewable energy sources. In the list of renewable energy sources, peat has not yet been mentioned. It is, however, at least in Finland, an important, sustainable, and slowly renewable source of energy. I hope that it can be added to the list of renewable energy sources at some point.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we have a fairly broad consensus on this ALTENER programme. I also hope that, in the negotiations with the Council, he is able to get at least the EUR 81.1 million we have been talking about. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, that, one day before the debate here in Parliament on the Kyoto follow-up conference in Bonn, and also a few days after the second-worst nuclear accident in history (this time in a hi-tech country), we should also place this ALTENER programme in a wider context. It is against a particular background that we are framing energy policy: we want to protect the environment and we want to cut down on CO2 emissions, so we must examine in particular whether the liberalisation of the European electricity market, as is at present being implemented in a number of Member States, is not counter-productive. Wholesale liberalisation in Germany is now already putting both biomass and solar projects under pressure and, in the social sphere, it will also, of course, result in our soon finding ourselves with a lot of little Michelin-style incidents because jobs are being rationalised out of existence so that power companies’ share prices rise. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it is time to analyse this liberalisation – in both ecological and social terms – and then to consider what are the good approaches. Personally, I particularly like the Danish model, where there is transparent access to the grid; there is an energy tax which corrects prices; there are clear targets for renewable energy sources; and there is an almost protected market. We also need a protected market for renewable energy sources and for block-type thermal power stations. In my view, merely national corrective measures or national “protective barriers” of an ecological and social nature are insufficient. We must also consider, at a European level, how we might build in corrective features. We naturally want this “feed-in directive” adopted very quickly. I believe we need mechanisms in the field of renewable energy sources similar to those we have today for nuclear energy. We need an export guarantee because, all in all, renewable energy sources mean many more jobs and better environmental protection. Renewable energy sources should be worth that to us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be impossible to reach the target to double this figure with the current way of thinking, which would have us believe that oil and gas will last for ever, and if they do not, coal is cheap in any case. Far too little money has been devoted to the ALTENER programme. It is self-delusory to apply such small sums of money to good ends. We are deceiving ourselves by investing so little in a new approach. The security of the EU must also be considered. By 2020, 94% of the quantity of oil needed in the EU will be imported, as well as 80% of the coal and 75% of the gas. If we leave the future of our energy in such a precarious position, we will not be able to provide a secure future for our people.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Rothe said, 12% is not enough. Mr Langen said that the resources made available are not enough to ensure 12% of production and, yet again, in spite of these warnings, we are going to adopt this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to take a broader view of the question. It is not enough to see the amounts, which are quite inadequate, that we are going to spend on renewable energies; we should perhaps also take a little time to consider the financial energies which we are expending on other forms of energy, particularly nuclear energy. Our colleague from the Group of the Greens mentioned the tragic events in Japan, and yet Japan is not a problem country or an underdeveloped country. So today, in the same annual period, we will be allocating EUR 60 million to nuclear fission as against EUR 15 million to renewable energies, and EUR 200 million to nuclear fusion. That gives us an idea of the real policies which the European Union is pursuing. It is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Especially now that a number of Member States have decided to abandon their nuclear policy, including their fission policy, we cannot accept that the Union as such should continue to finance nuclear policy by up to four times as much. We must become aware of these disparities. We must demand sums that are at least greater than those allocated to an energy about which we know nothing – nuclear fusion. We must immediately abolish the appropriations which we allocate to nuclear fission and transfer them entirely and directly to renewable energies. This is the next challenge, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the great nuclear States of Europe such as Germany are questioning their nuclear programmes, when France is starting to talk about doing so, we cannot continue to spend such vast sums, four times, let me say again, what we are spending on renewable energies, on these energy policies. It is not acceptable. I therefore ask my fellow Members to vote against this draft agreement, especially as the Council has the audacity to cavil at a few million. But, of course, the problem does not lie here. The problem is one of resources. 12%, as Mrs Rothe said, is not enough. We should set ourselves far more ambitious objectives, and this Parliament must force the Council and the Commission to find the resources necessary for this policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to see our new Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio. We look forward to working with her and we hope she will soon share, if she does not already, our enthusiasm for renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the SAVE Programme, we have in ALTENER II a way of showing the public of Europe that there are rational ways to meet the challenge of climate change: energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. We are asking Member States to pledge their commitment to the encouragement of renewable energy – and they all say, individually, that they have this commitment – by signing a Charter on renewable energy – the EURENEW Charter. This would symbolise the added value of working together in the EU on society’s wishes and needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the environmental benefits of renewable energy are obvious. But Mr Langen wisely reminds us of the enormous potential for European industry. One needs only to look at Denmark. And I fully support his call for the European Renewable Energies Export Council to be strengthened. Sadly, we lost one of the driving forces with the sudden death, earlier this year, of John Bonda, but others will carry on his work in the Export Council. I must say I am very pleased at the vocational training element of ALTENER II. That is to be welcomed. The budget is clearly inadequate and has to be increased if this programme is to be properly effective. I hope that an indication can be given by the Council in time for the appropriate changes to be made in the first reading of the 2000 budget. The emphasis on information dissemination in ALTENER II is very important indeed, and I look forward, if it is available yet, to looking at the Agores Centre on the Worldwide Web which is clearly intended to bring together all sorts of information on renewable energy so that everyone can look it up and can be kept up-to-date.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside ALTENER, and the research into renewable energy in the 5th Framework Programme, which we hope will be very significant, we need urgent flanking measures such as the “feed-in directive” for the electricity market. I hope we will hear more about this shortly from the Commission. The White Paper raised expectations, and we look forward to the exciting campaign for take-off with its 1 million PV systems, its large windfarm, its biomass and most exciting of all its 100 communities where all the electricity will come from renewable energy. There is nowhere in the whole of European Union where renewable energy is not relevant, whether it is Lapland or the Islands of Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALTENER II Programme will work and can work in every Member State and of course, outside the European Union in applicant countries, for example, as well as in the Mediterranean countries where the potential is huge. Renewable energy should become the symbol of what is sensible and progressive about Europe. This programme will help us obtain that symbol.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Utilising renewable sources of energy is a model example for the development and use of the most modern technologies which, at the same time, contribute to caring for the environment. However, there is also a second aspect. If one looks at those firms in Europe which are particularly involved in this area, it can be seen that these are mainly small and medium-sized companies. And, of course, since these small and medium-sized companies have, with these new technologies, made a considerable contribution to the employment policy of securing jobs, it is also a question of continuing to support them. </p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the big energy concerns in which employees are being laid off, by launching this programme and by promoting alternative energy sources, we are also making a contribution as Europeans to increasing the status of employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it must, of course, be said that this programme also has a special significance from the point of view of the enlargement of the EU eastwards. Of course, we are also concerned with bringing regenerative, environmentally-friendly energy production to these particular countries in order both to promote the protection of the environment and also of course – this must be added in all honesty – to open up new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">To that extent, the resources made available for the ALTENER programme are in no way adequate. They must be increased, and the European Council must also be more heavily involved in the export of renewable energy sources. In that way, expertise can be combined and translated more quickly into effective action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must, as far as possible, move beyond the mere declarations of intent which have been heard so many times over the last decade, and find strong concrete applications if we want to achieve this target, a very modest one by the way, of 12%. It is only on this condition that the European Union will be able to provide itself with an energy policy which is durable, balanced and fully secure. It is of course the European Commission’s task to work towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, two strategies have been developed through two multiannual programmes: SAVE II and ALTENER II. What must be done today, at their second reading is, of course, to renew both of these programmes, but also to improve them, with the help of the opportunities given to us by the Treaty of Amsterdam and by codecision. As far as the Langen report is concerned, and this is really what my intervention is about, as well as sources of renewable energy, everyone knows how important these energies are in reducing pollution and in preserving natural resources. We are also aware of the difficulties preventing these sources of energy from entering a free market in which more traditional energy resources are often much cheaper, not to mention the absence of measures designed to promote the taking up of new energies on a voluntarist basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, why I approve of the amendments tabled by Mr Langen which demand that the Commission plays a more active role in encouraging a strategy of coordinated promotion within the Member States as well as developing Europe’s potential for exporting technologies connected with renewable energy. It is true that this will entail additional costs. We must bear these costs because they are actually quite modest compared to what is at stake: around EUR 7 million. I also approve, of course, of the call for a charter on renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I shall say that the vote for these two reports represents a pledge to the citizens of Europe, showing the European Union’s will to protect the environment whilst reducing our dependence on energy. This is also a statement and a measure against the dictatorship of the market and of out-and-out liberalism. More specifically, on the threshold of the next world conference on climate change which is to be held in Bonn, this sends out a positive sign of our Kyoto commitment to reduce CO2 emissions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Langen, the rapporteur, on his report on the adoption of the multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community, Altener II. A number of people have made critical comments about the nuclear programme in the Community. Fusion power is perhaps technically renewable energy, nevertheless this is not what we are talking about here. This is a report that originated with the Commission proposal in November 1997 which the last Parliament considered at first reading, in the Robles Piquer report, in February.</p>
<p class="contents">Now with the Treaty of Amsterdam we have moved over to codecision and we are having a second reading here today. The major thrust of the report is the demand for the doubling of the amount of renewable energy to 12% by 2010. This is something we clearly support in the Socialist Group, but I am not entirely sure that commitment is accompanied either by the political resources – which is one of the reasons we are asking for the campaign to encourage and foster renewable energy – or, more importantly, by the financial resources. The amount that is being allocated is far too small in my view and does not add up in terms of achieving a doubling. We have EUR 80 million allocated: EUR 30 million for 1998-99 and EUR 50 million for 2000-2002. It seems to me, firstly, that the amount available is far too little and secondly, if we are expecting a doubling of the amount of renewable energy, there should be a sharp increase in the amount of money being made available over a period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, even this may not be allocated given that Amendment No 5 to Article 1(3) (new), actually says that the amount of money might have to be reduced if it is inconsistent with the financial perspective for the period in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Amendment No 6 to Article 2(e)(a) (new) about the need to encourage the export of renewable energy technologies from the European Union and to encourage the European Renewable Energies Export Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, a number of short points: renewable energies cannot be shoe-horned into the current thinking of energy suppliers, who are trained to see energy production as always being large scale and costing hundreds or thousands of millions of euros in terms of each project. Many will be small, community-based schemes which will be site-specific, whether using wind, waves, solar power, combined heat and power or even biomass. That means, if we are to encourage lots of small schemes, that we need even more money.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we are serious about exports we should also pay some attention to renewable energy sources in which we in the European Union have a technological lead, which is not necessarily the case here. One of which I am aware of is ocean thermal energy conversion that uses the temperature difference between the cold bottom waters of the tropics and the warm surface waters. We have a lead in Europe but we are not encouraging that. If we want to export these technologies we need to make sure that the resources are available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To this end, I would like to thank Mr Langen who is continuing the work of his predecessor, Mr Robles Piquer, a great promoter of these forms of renewable energy. Furthermore, to an extent, both Mr Langen and Mr Robles Piquer have demonstrated that this is not an ideological issue, that we must not mix up questions of liberalism or non-liberalism with what must be our ultimate common objective, which is to promote the use of renewable energy in Europe. This is an effort which corresponds to and obeys two key objectives of European energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, an energy policy which respects the environment; an energy policy which takes into account the future of our planet. This must be a characteristic not only of our energy policy but also of any policy worthy of its name on this dawning of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must examine something which is of great concern in Europe: our dependence on third countries with regard to the supply of energy. As soon as we are able to achieve our objective of doubling our sources of renewable energy supply from the current 6% to 12%, we will be less dependent on third countries, some of which may be facing a difficult future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, Mr President, that the first ALTENER programme and later the White Paper on Renewable Energy Sources, which has developed Community strategy and the action plan for 2010, have been possible thanks, and I repeat, to the cooperation between our two institutions, Parliament and the Commission, and that the new European Union renewable energy policy has been put together precisely as a result of a good understanding between us.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the ALTENER programme, which is the second bearing this name, we are now confronted with its enlargement and incorporation into the multiannual framework programme for action in the field of energy. Please allow me, having congratulated Mr Langen on his magnificent work, to also express my gratitude to all the other speakers during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Langen and the proposed amendments, which have also been mentioned by some of the other speakers, it is my pleasure to announce that the Commission can accept practically all of them, although I will make some particular points with regard to the last three. Some will be accepted in their entirety. In the case of some others, I will request a different wording which will render them acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendment No 1, the Commission has always believed that renewable energy policy and energy efficiency policy are closely linked, as some speakers have pointed out, and that the coordination of these two policies is essential. Reference is made to a EURONEW charter<span class="italic">,</span> and we must ask ourselves whether it may be premature given that we have little perspective on the strategies and action plans which have already been approved. Perhaps we need a little more time.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3, especially once the working document of the Commission services on the renewal campaign, which has been communicated to Parliament and the Council, has been adopted, is not only acceptable to the Commission but we embrace it with great satisfaction and gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 is acceptable in principle, although the Commission considers that it does not so much constitute a third objective of the programme but rather an expansion of the first objective.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to Amendment No 6, I would like to remind you of the favourable acceptance by the Commission of the Parliament’s report on the European Union’s new perspectives in the field of the export of technology and services for the use of renewable energy when it was presented in the plenary meeting on 15 January. However, it is a question of, rather than requiring a new action, considering whether point 25 does not already reflect this need to prioritise exports in order to improve the position of the European industry, which is world leader in certain renewable energy sources, which some speakers have referred to, because in this field we have clear advantages over other producers. This is perhaps where most progress has been made, in Europe and in this field, in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos. 2 and 7, as well as Nos. 8 and 9, which have reached us in the course of today, have the support of the Commission in principle, although their wording will have to be revised and adapted to a form which is acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 is in accordance with the initial proposal of the Commission. It is therefore totally acceptable. With regard to Amendment No 10, when it mentions associated Mediterranean countries and Cyprus, I would like to know exactly what we are talking about and therefore tomorrow, when the vote is taken, Mr Patten will raise this question. But alternatively, during our future discussions, we could talk about this issue so that we can specify who and what we are referring to, which would be the most appropriate way, from our point of view, to deal with the concern that this amendment clearly raises.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like once again to congratulate Mr Langen on his contribution to the continuation and consolidation of the ALTENER programme, since we must remember that this programme is our main instrument, although not from a financial point of view, in the carrying out of the European Union’s strategy on renewable energy. It is undoubtedly the main instrument of coordination, control and monitoring of that strategy. There is no doubt that a key question in all of this will be the Directive on access to the electricity network for renewable energy sources. This will clearly be the key instrument in order to see whether we are capable of promoting the use of this type of energy within our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the sources of renewable energy, in the support systems – apart from hydroelectricity, which does achieve very competitive results when compared to other energy sources – cannot compete with traditional sources of energy. Not even in the case of biomass, which is one of the alternative sources which clearly has its place within the framework of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">And it is clearly through the possibility of providing access to the network, through being flexible enough in the proposals that we put forward, which allow us to cover the different instruments which the different Member States have used and which are not homogenous and are different, that we will be able to guarantee that renewable energy is not only maintained but doubled in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my thanks once again and say that I hope that the final revision will contain the definitive formula and therefore provide an impetus for the ALTENER programme, which will clearly promote the use of renewable energy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
