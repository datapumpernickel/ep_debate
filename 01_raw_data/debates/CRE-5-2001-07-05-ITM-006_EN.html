Secondly, we must make it clear that it is time to move on to the next stage, which is to prepare for the General Assembly of the United Nations and the possibility of adopting a resolution on a moratorium on executions.

We have therefore made progress. Today the European Union is united against the death penalty, and this is reflected in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 2, where it mentions the right to life. I recall that, when we were discussing this Charter, many in the Convention used to say to us: ‘It is inconsistent to say that this Charter is directed to the institutions of the Union,’ and you, Mr President, will no doubt remember this, ‘and at the same time demand the abolition of the death penalty, when the European Union cannot condemn anybody to death.’</p>
<p class="contents">It is true: there was an inconsistency there. We accepted it, however, because we believed that the Charter had to embody the values and principles that underpin the construction of Europe. I must also tell you that recently, Mr President, when I was on a flight here, I was reading the news that the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that the Constitution of that country would have to be rewritten because, in order to join the European Union, it was necessary to abolish the death penalty, as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I remembered the title of that Oscar-winning film, ‘Life is Beautiful’, and realised that our work does occasionally bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I believe not only that we Europeans should proclaim our desire that the death penalty should be abolished, but that we have a right and a duty to interfere in the affairs of other countries so that they do the same. For that reason, complying with a resolution of a conference held two weeks ago in Strasbourg, we have asked in this resolution – which I am sure will gain the unanimous support of this House – for a special day against the death penalty to be set up: a European day, which I hope will soon be a world day, since I believe there is room for hope. My good friend, Mrs Ana Palacio, who reads everything that is published, has today given me the editorial from the <span class="italic">Herald Tribune</span>, in which a Supreme Court judge, Mrs O’Connor, who has always been in favour of the death penalty, is today saying the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that, if intelligent people change their minds, we shall be able to win this battle throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Too often, innocent people are given the death penalty. The penalty is irrevocable, and a subsequent appeal, even if fresh evidence is submitted, is no longer possible. The death penalty is downgrading and is in contravention of the universal principle of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Joaquín José Martínez was recently acquitted in the United States. He came to visit us here in Parliament after he had been in prison for quite a few years. It became apparent that in his case, everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. According to Amnesty International, at least 1 475 prisoners were executed and more than 3 000 death penalties given in 2000. China, Iran, Saudi-Arabia and the United States account for approximately 88% of those. The first world congress against the death penalty took place here in Strasbourg between 21 and 23 June: 87 countries in the world uphold the death penalty, to which the under-aged and also mentally handicapped people often fall victim.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much regret the fact that countries which often boast a very high standard in terms of human rights still elect to use this penalty, and execute – what often later appears – innocent people, while it is often clear from statistics – this is especially pronounced in the US – that social and racial aspects play a major role.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also extremely concerned about the fact that the organs of those involved are subsequently offered for sale. I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo that a European day against the death penalty would be extremely useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to draw your attention to point 4 of the resolution which states that we urge the Belgian Presidency now to try to organise another vote in the sitting of the General Assembly of the United Nations in September on a resolution to abolish the death penalty. We hope that the Presidency, on behalf of all EU countries, will be able to count on sufficient support so that this time the resolution can be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament is continuing its long and dedicated battle against this barbaric punishment, and we know that we have a good ally in Commissioner Patten. Commissioner, we <span class="italic">really</span> appreciate your work in this area. Our joint fight has resulted in one applicant country after another abolishing the death penalty. This requirement is irrevocable for membership of the European Community. It is high time that Turkey also abolished the death penalty – without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">It can sometimes feel hopeless fighting against the death penalty when the world is the way it is. Mr Van den Berg has just mentioned figures showing the worldwide situation. It is important to note that 90 per cent of all executions occur in only four countries. The worst by far is China with over <span class="italic">1 000 </span>executions this year alone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also deeply tragic to have to place the US on the same list as the dictatorships. Over and over again, we have appealed to the American leaders to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty and to stop sentencing teenagers and the mentally disabled to death. Just the suspicion that one single person has been falsely executed – and we know this has happened in the US – should be sufficient reason to abolish the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. It is encouraging that there is a certain, albeit slow, shift in opinion in the US. It is also the case that, during the 1990s, 30 countries abolished the death penalty. Here in Strasbourg, a successful conference was held two weeks ago. Both the EU and the European Council will continue to fight tirelessly.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to further strengthen the fight against the death penalty and to ensure that this issue is always on the agenda, a year ago in this House my colleague Mr Rutelli proposed a European day against the death penalty. We could hold this every year until the death penalty is abolished everywhere. It is encouraging that this is also the view of this House, and I hope that the Council and the Commission can work with the European Parliament to bring about such a day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last five years, I have had the impression that whenever we place this dramatic issue, this routine horror of the death penalty on the agenda, the House has been a kind of debating society. Everybody expresses their condemnation and their righteous indignation, but when the moment comes to decide what to do about the indifference, the apathy and the determination of some countries to insist on these barbaric institutions, the mood changes because obviously money talks. Mercantile relations are very important for everybody, and while it is good to denounce the sin, we need to identify the sinners.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why in this resolution that we are going to pass, I would like very much to add the names of the sinners. First of all, the People's Republic of China. We have read yesterday and today what happened with the so-called ‘suicide’ of 15 women in a concentration camp.</p>
<p class="contents">We passed resolutions in this House two years ago about the trade in human organs transplanted from executed people. Now we have to start thinking about, for instance, not voting enthusiastically for giving the Olympic Games to the People's Republic of China without reservation.

Our resolution mentions 87 countries which still have the death penalty. I do not think that figure – which is provided by Amnesty International – is accurate. There are actually 71 countries which continue to apply the death penalty, and I think the difference is important given that there are 180 countries in the international community and that means the majority of abolitionist countries is much bigger than Amnesty International’s figures suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I do not think we need to regard Amnesty International either as a bible for a whole series of issues, or indeed as a representative of civil society, which is not at all the case. It is an association which does a certain job and which, in my opinion, also deserves a critical look from us from time to time, if not more frequently.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – as Monica Frassoni said, along with Mr van den Berg and Mr Manisco – I think the problem is to come to the United Nations Assembly General with a resolution on the moratorium. The problem is not to abolish death. I think there are sometimes temptations in that direction. Our problem is to abolish the death penalty because we believe there is a way to render justice without recourse to it. The problem therefore consists of obtaining a moratorium, an entirely secular initiative, designed to lead other governments to consider the arguments against the death penalty and conclude, in a wise, secular way, that it is no longer necessary. Consequently I believe our work over the next few weeks will be important to enable the Belgian Presidency to present a resolution on a moratorium in New York. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The abolitionists, who have met in Strasbourg at the first world conference against the death penalty, can count – and know they can count – on our full and active support.</p>
<p class="contents">A European day against the death penalty – as Mr Méndez de Vigo was saying, and I agree with him – is a good idea, but it is not enough. We must also encourage the Community institutions and the European Union Member States to take our belief to its ultimate consequences – our belief, which without any doubt is reflected in all our legal systems, that the death penalty is against the law and is just as bad as other historical monstrosities, such as slavery. The European Union should, therefore, as we request in the resolution, consider the abolition of the death penalty to be an essential aspect of its relations with third countries, and consequently this should be reflected in the conclusions of international agreements, aid programmes and trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Mr Van den Berg has already done so, I do not wish to mention such aberrations as the execution of minors or the physically disabled, nor to talk about cases of innocent people condemned to death. I shall not go into the figures, either – because what Mr Dupuis has just said is true – and in any case I think they are irrelevant: a single case is itself a monstrosity. The abolition of the death penalty is an elementary principle in the state of civilisation in which we now find ourselves, and nobody should be deprived of their life by a court sentence. I therefore support both this resolution and the European day against the death penalty, but I believe we still have to go a little further in all our work to achieve the abolition of the death penalty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very important work was accomplished during those three days and I also salute the personal commitment of our President who, with her counterpart from the Council of Europe, called on the governments to establish a world moratorium on executions. That moratorium was signed by the 40 countries present, here, in this very Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Fighting for the abolition of the death penalty – as has been said here – means fighting to strengthen human dignity and extend human rights. I think the European Union is doing that and it must continue its efforts, but I also think it is sometimes important, in an assembly like the United Nations, to put one’s own house in order first. By that I mean that countries like Turkey, Russia and Armenia, members of the Council of Europe and applicants to join the European Union, must eliminate the death penalty from their respective criminal codes. That, in my opinion, is a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>of whether or not they become members and a guarantee that this fundamental principle of human rights is respected within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, as Robert Badinter has underlined, the debate has moved forward enormously. One hundred countries have already abolished the death penalty. Even in the United States, where 80% of people were in favour of the death penalty five or six years ago, that figure is down to 66% today. That means that the struggle is making progress, and so much the better.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that has not prevented the existence of another highly symbolic case in the battle against the death penalty: the case of Moumia Abou Jamal. From amongst the 3 700 people who are still on death row in the United States, Moumia Abou Jamal stands out as a symbol because he is in prison and on death row for being black, and in that respect his case reminds me a little of the struggle of Nelson Mandela. He is in prison for being an intellectual writer, and in that he reminds me a little of Solzhenitsyn, and because he dared to write at a time when no one was writing against the atrocities of the Philadelphia police. And finally he was a militant, an activist as they say in English.</p>
<p class="contents">He now finds himself on death row for these three reasons and I think it would be a marvellous signal if a country like the United States, which claims to be the greatest democracy in the world, were to abolish the death penalty and free Moumia Abou Jamal. Imagine the weight that would carry for countries like China and the other countries that continue this barbaric practice!</p>
<p class="contents">I am counting massively on the Belgian Presidency to move this idea forward with the full support of all of us here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The death penalty violates the right to life and is degrading. According to Amnesty International, 1457 people were executed in 2000, of which 85 were executed in the USA, 1000 in China, 75 in Iran and 123 in Saudi Arabia. In Iran last week, a woman was condemned to death by stoning for adultery. It puts one in mind of the Middle Ages. This cruelty outrages and horrifies me. No death sentences have been carried out in Turkey since 1984, it is true, but people are still condemned to death. This is unacceptable, especially in a country which aspires to become a member of the EU. Turkey must abolish the death penalty before it can be accepted in the European Union. Every time a death penalty is carried out, there is a possibility that an innocent person has been executed. Such cases have occurred in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly concerned about the current debate in Russia on the restoration of the death penalty. Five years after the last execution, more and more people are calling for the death penalty to be reintroduced for terrorists and drug dealers. I should like to remind Russia that it undertook to abolish the death penalty when it joined the Council of Europe five years ago. Armenia and Turkey must also honour this commitment as members of the Council of Europe. The first world congress against capital punishment was held in Strasbourg in June. I welcome events such as this, which endeavour to find ways of abolishing the death penalty. I consider the death penalty to be a barbaric institution. It is cruel and inhumane. I condemn all 87 countries which still have the death penalty and call on those responsible to abolish it.</p>

In the Spanish press we have read an article which, I believe, is a good reflection of the feelings of this Parliament against the death penalty. I do not know if it has appeared in the press in other countries in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to recall here, Mr President, that on the other two occasions on which I spoke against the death penalty I talked about a Spaniard who was on death row in the United States, Joaquín José Martínez. I had the chance to talk to him and his parents last week, and among other chilling details that they told me was the 100 million pesetas that they had to raise to have their son released. This is a common situation for minorities in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I confess that I never thought he could be released, and I am delighted to have seen him here alive. The death penalty in my view is barbaric, Mr President. Eighty-eight per cent of these death penalties are concentrated in four countries, and so Europe must talk to these countries to get them to stop murdering each other legally. Our presence in the United Nations should also be used, as it always has been, to come out against the death penalty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the House knows, both the Council and the Commission have made abolition a priority. The Council is pursuing implementation of the European Union guidelines where the death penalty still exists. The European Union calls for its use to be progressively restricted and insists that it be carried out according to minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also presses, where relevant, for moratoria to be introduced. It might just be helpful if I set out in detail the guidelines of our policy towards third countries on the death penalty. Those guidelines stipulate that the subject should be mentioned, if appropriate, during political dialogue with those countries. It was mentioned, for example, in our recent meetings with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines stipulate that démarches should be made when there is a threat that the death penalty will be restored or that an official or de facto moratorium will cease. The guidelines make it clear that supportive démarches or public statements should be made when a country takes steps towards abolition. We indicate, in the guidelines, that individual démarches should be made when it seems that minimum standards in this area are being violated. For example: when there is a lack of legal safeguards; when the death penalty is to be applied to those who were minors when the offence was committed; to pregnant women or to the mother of a young child or to the mentally ill and the application of the death penalty for non-violent crimes or offences such as crimes of opinion and conscience and financial crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the recently adopted communication on human rights and democratisation, the Commission identified the campaign for the abolition of the death penalty as one of the four priorities that we would pursue over coming years under the European initiative for democracy and human rights. We have already funded a number of projects in this area by mobilising public opinion worldwide against capital punishment. We hope to consign the death penalty to the history books as a form of punishment which has no place in the modern world. To take an example, and I follow what an honourable Member said a moment or two ago, I find it almost impossible to believe that I am reading a newspaper published in 2001 when I read reports that women in Iran are once again being sentenced to death by stoning.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with honourable Members that the first World Congress to abolish the death penalty in Strasbourg on 21 and 22 June 2001 was a very important gathering. While I was not able to attend in person, the Commission services represented me and delivered an address. I understand that the presence of those individuals who came to the Congress to testify about the years they had spent awaiting execution before being declared innocent was particularly moving and particularly valuable. Also, I believe that the Congress proved useful in highlighting both the difficult problems related to the abolition of the death penalty and in gathering suggestions of a number of innovative policy strategies, in particular, from the American participants. It was interesting to hear the honourable Member's remarks about recent converts on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take this opportunity to thank the President for her initiative to invite a number of presidents of parliaments as well as the Congress participants to attend the solemn appeal that took place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 June last. This was an important part of the Congress highlighting the important role of parliaments in eliminating the death penalty. The Strasbourg appeal that was adopted at this event will serve as an important reference document for our continued efforts to abolish the death penalty. I am sure that as long as it is required, this Parliament along with the other European institutions, will continue to give this issue the priority and the importance which it deserves.</p>
