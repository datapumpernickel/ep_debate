<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Terrón i Cusí </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES) </span> Mr President, as you have just stated, tonight we are going to debate an action plan on the influx of immigrants from Iraq and the neighbouring regions. This report was adopted on 26 June 1998, though Parliament was consulted only a few months ago, when the action plan had already been under way for almost a year. The Committee on Civil Liberties and I would have welcomed the opportunity to prepare a report on the measures proposed in this action plan at an appropriate time, and we felt that it was somewhat ridiculous to be called on to do so a year after the plan had been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as rapporteur, I therefore wished to take advantage of the opportunity provided by consultation and present a political report on this plan and its implementation. Parliament should not be criticised for failing to put forward its opinion at a more appropriate moment as it was consulted at an impossible time. As we prepared the report, we put certain questions to the Council which, in our view, were crucial. We asked the Council how many people were involved and about the extent of the immigration. We asked about the result of the proposed measures, which had already been in force on the ground for almost a year, and we also enquired about the impact of the action plan on illegal immigration and on the criminal activities of those who traffic in people. We also wanted to know how many people had sought asylum and been processed since the action plan had been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that such information can be hard to obtain. Nevertheless, I most earnestly hope that someone somewhere is in possession of it by now, though the Committee on Civil Liberties and Parliament most certainly are not. We have not managed to find out anything. No information has been made available to us, and we received no response to the questions we asked.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding this state of affairs, I attempted to analyse all the various aspects of the Council"s proposal. It should be said in the Council"s defence that this action plan represents an attempt to adopt a global approach to a problem which Parliament had already highlighted in a resolution on this issue dated 15 January 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain aspects of the action plan have given me particular cause for concern. Firstly, I am unhappy that very different situations are being jumbled up together and dealt with in the same way under the plan. When we refer euphemistically to ‘immigrants from Iraq and the neighbouring regions", we also include a Kurdish area torn apart by a political conflict which has resulted in strong repression. We are therefore dealing here with a displaced population seeking protection in more peaceful areas. The action plan refers to this in passing, along with actions aimed at other population groups which are indeed part of the same flow of migrants but for very different reasons. Mixed in with these we find actions directed against trafficking in people. We are in favour of measures against trafficking in people, but we believe that each of these specific issues should be tackled with the appropriate measures. A distinction should be made between asylum seekers, those who are fleeing a conflict, and the activities of those who traffic in people. Although the composition of this flow of migrants is undoubtedly varied, we do not believe that this is a valid excuse for failing to make the necessary distinctions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we are also rather concerned about Turkey"s part in the action plan. Given its geographical location, Turkey is bound to be the first country to receive these displaced people. It is essential, however, that their human dignity be respected. Turkey should allow the UNHCR to organise the initial reception process, particularly since, for refugees from northern Iraq and especially those from Kurdistan, Turkey is part of the problem and cannot therefore be considered a safe third country for these people. Respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities in Turkey must take precedence over cooperation and aid in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Members of the Council – I trust you are present in the House today, because if you are not, what we are engaged in is fairly pointless – could you please enlighten us as to what exactly an action plan is meant to be? We have no idea. We know all about joint actions within the framework of the CFSP, we know all about other procedures, but an action plan is something new, and we would like to be informed of the basis on which this decision was taken. It seems to us that the decision lacked a sound legal basis. We therefore call on the Commission to present a new proposal in three months" time, and for Parliament to be consulted before the Council takes a decision. We would also like information regarding the budget allocation for all this. We sincerely hope that such information does exist and that it will be made available to Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lambrias </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, once again the Council of Ministers is addressing itself to the European Parliament rather late in the day. It is requesting Parliament"s opinion on an action plan, as the rapporteur has said, after this was adopted by the Council in January 1998 without prior consultation, as required by Article K.6 of the Treaty. Is the content of the action plan so insignificant that this oversight can be forgiven?</p>
<p class="contents">Quite the opposite. The problem that has to be solved is an enormous, complex and extremely difficult one. It has arisen in the most sensitive and inflammable region bordering on our continent. It is a running sore that is getting worse and spreading to many countries where streams of refugees are taking shelter. It is putting our humanitarianism and our civilisation to the test. The swarms of refugees and dispossessed persons, be they Kurds from Iraq or, for all kinds of reasons, outcasts from neighbouring countries, are being caught in the nets of those who trade in illegal immigrants and falling into lawlessness and poverty. Every day we learn of appalling events, the victims of which include women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">In her comprehensive and very thorough report, the rapporteur rightly calls for a new proposal to be submitted within three months and for consultations with the European Parliament to take place. Only in this way can Member States participate in this action according to the letter of the law. The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs is unanimously agreed, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy has delivered a unanimous opinion. However, the rapporteur does not fail to point out the weaknesses, the naivety and the omissions that characterise this plan, which has been adopted in fits and starts. Nor does she deny that illegal immigration must be tackled with great severity, but this severe approach must not be indiscriminately merciless. It is hypocritical of us to ignore the fact that, in this way, the notion of asylum is discredited, when rejection or repatriation is often tantamount to a death sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that a central, governing role is being entrusted to Turkey, which has just such a past, with its violation of human rights, the state of its penal institutions and, in general terms, its inability to function in a proper judicial way, is simply a joke in very bad taste. The fact that it is being entrusted with such a role by the Council in respect of a problem which Turkey itself is trying to eliminate through military operations can only be seen as a very poor joke.</p>

Measures were of course needed to cope with the exodus from Kurdistan and so on, but all those measures ought to have been taken much earlier. One might say that the Council had been fast asleep for years, and by the time it woke up the Kurdish migrants were already in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question is this: what has actually come of all the measures taken under that action plan? We have no clear picture of them. We think that Parliament really ought to be properly briefed on this. On the subject of briefing, another sign of panic on the part of the Council last year was that Parliament as a whole was not properly involved in the decision‐making process. The rapporteur, Mrs Terrón, made this point and it is outrageous. That is tough talk, I know, and I mean it. We as Parliament should have given our opinion on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week saw the resignation of the Commission, but I think that the Council, in matters falling under the third pillar, has possibly treated Parliament even worse. So there is work to be done here. It means, as paragraph 1 of the resolution says, that there must within three months be a good overview and a proper new proposal on which Parliament is consulted. The European Commission has to provide that. I trust it will be able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also relevant to relations with Turkey. They continue to be difficult, of course. The ELDR Group believes that the dialogue with Turkey must continue on issues such as the acceptance of Kurdish migrants in the region and the improving of human rights generally. On these matters too, both the European Commission and the Council must keep Parliament properly informed.</p>

Her criticism of the action plan is warranted too. The European Union can use its policy as a means of ensuring that the people of that region are able to focus their lives on their homeland and to live on their native soil where they feel at home. As long as we in the European Union cannot eliminate the root causes of these refugee movements, as long as there is no peace in the region and as long as the political repression of minorities is common practice, we need an efficiently administered asylum procedure as proposed by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also supports your proposals on dealing with Turkey as the country of initial reception for refugees from Iraq. It is very important to us that the organisation and implementation of this initial reception in Turkey should be entrusted to the UNHCR alone. We also subscribe to Mrs Terrón i Cusí's view that the Commission must present a new proposal, on which the opinion of the European Parliament must be heard, before the Council takes its decision. That would be an exemplary procedure and would befit the serious nature of the matter under discussion.</p>

It is important to devise a policy for the long term. The plan designed for large numbers of refugees is largely rendered inappropriate by the decline in the number of refugees. This may mean that the policy has worked. But we do not have the information which would allow us to assess its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need for transparency and clarity in the assessment criteria. Consulting the European Parliament on the action plan was the first step. This policy must also be viewed in its foreign policy context. In this region where there is conflict, oppression and a flouting of human rights, we have to be very careful about sending back refugees. Sending Kurds back to Turkey at present is inappropriate, to say the least. Nor is Iraq"s record one which justifies sending refugees back. We must be careful not to close our borders before we have conducted thorough analyses. It is vital for us to look at the deeper causes and resolve the problems on the spot. Let us hope that we can do so.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Mr President, in her report, Mrs Terrón y Cusí criticises the EU's action plan on the influx of migrants from Iraq and the neighbouring region. The report is critical both of the contents of the action plan and of the fact that the European Parliament became involved in this plan only after it had been adopted. On the question of form, I can understand the reason for her criticism. Parliament should have been able to have its say before such an important document was approved. At the same time, the implementation of the action plan is now the subject of a review.</p>
<p class="contents">As you probably know, the Council has set up a special high‐level group to prepare action plans for Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Morocco and Albania and the surrounding area. In addition, the Council has asked the high‐level group to review the implementation of the action plan on Iraq. The document which the rapporteur has laid before us is therefore extremely valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of the high‐level group is to formulate proposals as to who should be eligible to take advantage of the possibilities offered by the EU under all three pillars. The reasons are obvious: the situation differs from one country to another, so our migration policy should be adapted to suit the actual situation in each case. Naturally, the more political instruments we have at our disposal, the more flexible we can be. It also means making use of the whole range of possibilities offered by the Union, and Parliament's views are therefore also very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the financing of the project in Turkey, the Commission still firmly believes that it is only feasible if we receive guarantees that human rights are being respected. Furthermore, it is also our confirmed opinion that the UNHCR should be involved in any attempt to start up an asylum project in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, the Commission is urged to introduce measures to speed up the asylum process. The House may be pleased to learn that on 3 March the Commission, at my suggestion, approved a working document which includes proposals relating to that very issue. The purpose of the document is to initiate a wide‐ranging discussion with Parliament, the Member States and voluntary organisations on the framing of future asylum procedures in Europe. It starts by advocating a speeding‐up of the asylum process, but without undermining the right of people to have their requests for asylum considered in a thorough and objective way. I passed this working document on to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on the day it was approved. The Commission intends to put forward a formal proposal after the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force. I assume that before then the Commission will be informed of Parliament's views.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, Mrs Terrón y Cusí also mentions the need to help asylum‐seekers and refugees to return to their countries of origin. I should therefore like to recall that, in December 1998, I put forward a proposal to establish a legal basis for a budget line covering asylum provision and repatriation. Naturally, I am very disappointed that the discussions relating to our proposals for temporary protection and burden‐sharing have not made more progress in the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am still convinced that vigorous efforts are required to deal with the widespread smuggling of human beings that is going on all over Europe. Two protocols to the United Nations Convention on international organised crime are currently under discussion. The first is intended to step up the campaign against the smuggling of different types of migrants; the second to prevent and punish, above all, the smuggling of women and children. We have a unique opportunity to reach a common position in the Council of Ministers when the negotiations are resumed. We should therefore decide quickly on a European set of principles, so that we can defend what we consider to be an effective strategy in that area. The issue is now under discussion in the Council of Ministers. For that reason, today's debate is of great interest as regards the further implementation of the action plan.</p>

I would ask you, Mr President, to inform the Council that, as rapporteur, I find its attitude unacceptable and humiliating. I am grateful to Mrs Gradin for the explanations she has provided, and I agree entirely with her. Mrs Gradin has always adopted a positive attitude towards Parliament and I truly appreciate it. Her attitude contrasts sharply with that of certain people who have not even deigned to be present today, as we discuss a plan of action that has been in force for a year and three months, and on which we have belatedly been invited to express an opinion. Mr President, I would ask you once again to convey my personal indignation to the Council and also my hope that answers to the questions put to it may eventually be forthcoming.</p>

As I pointed out a few moments ago, the President announced at the start of the sitting that the Council would not be present. In actual fact – and this also applies to the previous debate – Rule 40 clearly stipulates that the institution to which a question is addressed has to give a reply. This is an unusual situation, and we shall therefore ensure that Parliament makes a specific request to the Council.</p>
