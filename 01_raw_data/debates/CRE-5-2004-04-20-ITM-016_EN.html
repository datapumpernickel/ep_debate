<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am delighted to be here today with my friend and colleague Commissioner Verheugen to present the Commission's <span class="italic">avis</span> on the possibility of opening accession negotiations with Croatia. The Commission is also publishing today its first European partnership with Croatia, which sets out priorities for both the short term and the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">In politics we very often overuse the word 'historic', but this is indeed a historic day for Croatia and this is an occasion which I know gives both Commissioner Verheugen and myself considerable personal pleasure.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia is the first of the Western Balkan countries to get to this stage, although I know that – perfectly understandably – Croatia would prefer a rather different description. Geography, as I have often said in the past in Zagreb, is not destiny. It is not a surprise that Croatia has reached this stage well ahead of any of its neighbours. Had it not been for the legacy of war, it might well have got to this stage on the road to membership a great deal earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia applied for membership in February 2003 and the Council asked us to prepare our opinion in April of that year, so it has taken us a year of hard work. I do not apologise, however, for the time that we have needed. Assessing a country's readiness for candidate status is one of the most important institutional duties that the Commission undertakes. I do not want to keep honourable Members in suspense, so let me tell you straight away that the College has decided today to recommend to the Council that accession negotiations be started with Croatia in due course.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think the applause is deserved, and if the occasion was less salubrious we could have managed a standing, rather than a crouching ovation!</p>
<p class="contents">Commission Verheugen and I would like to set out a little of the thinking behind the Commission's decision, and I am sure you will agree that it is important for us to say rather more clearly why we have arrived at this extremely welcome conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very beginning, it became clear that the most important areas for consideration were the political criteria set out in Copenhagen in 1993. There are a number of considerations which we had to bear in mind and I will touch on the main ones. The Croatian judiciary is – unhappily – poorly trained and organised and a huge backlog of cases is waiting to be considered. However, the independence of the judiciary is not in question. Croatia has a lot of work to do in improving the quality of judicial decision-making but it has – and we are convinced of this – a strategy for doing so and it now needs to implement that strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, Croatia's relations with its neighbours have not been entirely smooth recently. There have been difficult border disputes with Slovenia, as well as disputes over fishing rights in the Adriatic which were not helped by unilateral action by Croatia last year. However, since the election last December, the Croatian Government has shown a willingness to resolve these disputes in a sensible way based on mutual understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, there is the question of minority rights. This is extremely important to the Parliament; it is extremely important to all of us as Europeans. It is important that Croatia implements properly its legislation on minority rights. The OSCE has also reported to us that more needs to be done to ensure that Serbian refugees currently living in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia are able to return to their homes. However, the present government has concluded an agreement with the Croatian Serb leader, Mr Pupovac, designed to achieve that effect. There is still much to be done, however, but progress is being made: we welcome that and we are assured that it will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the most difficult issue, as it is throughout the region, has been the question of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia – ICTY. Our position is straightforward and it is well known: in line with regular conclusions of the European Council, we require that all the countries of the Western Balkans cooperate fully with the tribunal as a non-negotiable condition for progress down the Stabilisation and Association Process. We rely for our assessment on the opinion of the tribunal itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Until recently, Croatia's record was far from perfect – though I recognise that efforts were being made. However, in recent months, cooperation has been greatly improved. It is particularly worthy of note that two groups of indictments involving eight people, both Croats and Bosnian Croats, were dealt with speedily and without fuss by the Croatian Government. All eight were transferred to The Hague within a week or so of their indictments.</p>
<p class="contents">There remains the question of former General Ante Gotovina. He has been indicted for very serious crimes and remains at large. Commissioner Verheugen and I consulted the chief prosecutor of the tribunal and she gave both of us very clear advice. She concluded that Croatia was fully complying with the tribunal, and saw no likelihood of that situation changing. As far as the Gotovina case was concerned, she indicated that the Croatian Government was doing all it could to help locate him and turn him over to The Hague. We asked the referee, the referee gave us her decision and I do not believe that it is for us to try to second-guess her.</p>
<p class="contents">So, both our criteria have been met in full and the way is now clear for a positive assessment on this crucial issue. I must just add one thing: as we say in the <span class="italic">avis</span>, it is extremely important that Croatia continues to cooperate fully with the tribunal and that, in particular, the Croatians demonstrate very clearly that they are doing everything they can to locate and apprehend the remaining indictee. It is a matter for the Irish presidency to choose the date for the Council's consideration of our <span class="italic">avis</span>; I know that Member States will be watching this question very closely between now and then.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that this moment gives me considerable pleasure. I would like to congratulate all those with whom we have worked over the past few years, and who have laid the foundations for this decision. I would like to congratulate the present government on what it has done, and I hope this moment will be one for celebration in Croatia. With that I will hand you over to my colleague Commissioner Verheugen, who will indicate to the Parliament some of the other parts of the <span class="italic">avis</span> and give you some indication of the next steps.</p>

Yet again, we see that it is the prospect of European integration and membership of the European Union that is the most powerful force driving forward the process of political and economic reform in a country which, until recently, was being torn apart by war, civil war and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">My friend and colleague Chris Patten has already spoken about the political criteria. I would like to add a few words about the other, equally important, accession criteria. First of all, there is the issue of Croatia's economic performance. The question is whether the country meets the requirements of a market economy as we expect it to do and whether it has the capacity to cope with competitive pressure within the internal market. The findings of our analyses are very clear and very gratifying: Croatia is already better placed than most of the countries joining on 1 May at the time when their accession negotiations opened. Croatia can already be regarded as a functioning market economy, and provided that the policies of economic reform are continued, it should be able to cope with competitive pressure within the internal market in the medium term. The Croatian economy is already very strongly intermeshed with the economy of the European Union and is clearly outperforming the economies of Bulgaria and Romania, for example, whose accession is envisaged for 2007. From the economic perspective, we therefore see no problems or risks arising if accession negotiations are opened with Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the extremely difficult criterion concerning progress in adoption and implementation of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>: by their very nature, my comments can only be a prospective assessment. After all, adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> is the subject of the negotiations, not the prerequisite for their commencement. Nonetheless, our prospective assessment for Croatia is very positive, and we believe that Croatia will be able to undertake the necessary legislative alignment in all chapters of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>within the medium term<span class="italic"> </span>while at the same time strengthening the structures that are necessary for its genuine and effective implementation. Here, Croatia will rely on our help, and it goes without saying that the Commission is prepared to grant Croatia the same support and advice that it has provided over the last few years to the countries which are due to accede on 1 May. Here too, then, our assessment is positive.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the next steps, as Mr Patten has already said, it is a matter for the Council to decide whether and when the accession negotiations will open. Before these negotiations can formally begin, a comprehensive screening exercise needs to be undertaken. This entails a full review of the entire <span class="italic">acquis</span> and the extent to which it has been adopted and implemented in Croatia, so that we know exactly what needs to be covered in the negotiations. In other words, this is a normal procedure which is likely to take some time. Only then can the negotiations on the various chapters begin. A tailor-made pre-accession strategy will also have to be developed for Croatia, and the Commission is already dealing with this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards timing, my advice would be that it is premature to talk about timetables at this stage: we should not take the second step before the first. The pace of the process will depend on Croatia's capacity and determination to achieve real progress, both during the preparation and in the negotiations themselves. The Commission will assess progress fairly and objectively and will measure the progress of the negotiations on this basis. I believe that the Commission's recommendation sends an important and powerful signal not only to Croatia but to the entire region. It shows the other countries in the region which, for a variety of reasons, still have a long way to go before they come close to fulfilling the criteria, that intensive efforts pay off and that the European Union responds appropriately to the efforts of a country wishing to join the EU, and recognises that country's achievements.</p>

<p class="contents">My question is a very simple one, Mr Patten: do you think that Great Britain will take steps to cooperate more effectively with the Hague tribunal by using its troops stationed in Bosnia? It is in fact now clear that its argument that Croatia was not ready to become a member of the European Union is no longer valid since Mrs Del Ponte has given you and Mr Verheugen assurances that Croatia is cooperating fully with the Hague tribunal.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has received assurances from Croatia that it will help other countries in the region qualify for EU membership. I note in Commissioner Patten's report on the assessment by Carla Del Ponte that Croatia is complying in full with ICTY and doing all it can to find General Gotovina. Until recently we could not be sure that such efforts were genuinely being made. Is it the understanding of the Commissioner that the UK and the Netherlands will now ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Minister for Europe has now declared himself convinced of the efforts to find General Gotovina. Previously this was not the case and he pointed out, for instance, that General Gotovina's lawyer knew how to find him, but nobody else did. This is very important, because if we do not carry on the search for General Gotovina, how can we push for the capture of Radavan Karadzic and General Mladic? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My question, Commissioner, is not difficult, but I understand the difficulty which you have in giving a specific reply. Will there, in your opinion, be some timetable up to the final stage of the accession of Croatia? I also have a question for Mr Verheugen: does he believe in the light of his experience that, by the time Romania and Bulgaria join in 2007, Croatia will be ready with these countries to become a member of the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In response to Mr Dupuis, I say with all modesty – and it perhaps reflects the failures of my political career – that is a good 12 years since I have been able to say 'speaking on behalf of the British Government'. So my ability to respond on behalf of Her Majesty's administration in London is somewhat limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the United Kingdom Government will, as ever, take close note of what the honourable Member has said and I am sure – this also relates to the point that Baroness Ludford made – that both the government in the United Kingdom and the government in the Netherlands will want to reflect on the issue of ratification in view of the comments of the chief prosecutor at The Hague. I had noticed what the British Minister of State, Denis McShane, my old school mate, said yesterday in the region. He felt himself able to announce that we were going to make this very positive decision today, so we welcome his support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to what the honourable Member said about regional cooperation. In the last year there have been one or two difficulties, for example the dispute with Slovenia, which we regret and which we hope can now be resolved. It has, however, been a consistent feature of the way that governments have behaved over the last few years. Both Mr Racan's government and the present government have played an extremely positive role in working to resolve the problems in the region. I would like to pay a personal tribute to the former Foreign Minister, Mr Picula, who did a great deal to work constructively with the region, and I know that his successor will not mind me doing this. I am sure Mr Zuzul will follow that lead and I know that he and the Prime Minister have already taken steps which have encouraged others in the region to regard Croatia as an extremely cooperative partner.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Commissioner Verheugen may wish to add to what I have to say on the question of the timetable, but in my experience from watching him deal with enlargement over the last few years, the timetable depends above all on the efforts made by the states concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may offer one word of advice to the Croatian government it is that it should concentrate its energies, as it has done in the last few years, on substance rather than process. It should concentrate on getting on with making changes which will still be required, rather than focusing its energies on asking about dates and speculating about dates.</p>

First, the reservation of the British and Dutch Governments up to now has already been referred to. I know how convincing Mr Patten and Mr Verheugen can be, so I assume that the people in The Hague and in London also listen to them. May I assume for the time being that negotiations with Croatia will not start as long as the Stabilisation and Association Agreement has not been ratified? To be certain, I would like to put this question to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I am pleased that the chief prosecutor, Mrs Del Ponte, is positive now, but it seems to me important that she also remains so in the future. Is the Commission willing to recommend that this very specific tribunal, the chief prosecutor herself, continues to be involved in the future with monitoring Croatia's cooperation with this tribunal? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South-East Europe, and on behalf of all those who have no opportunity to speak today, I would like to express my warm thanks to the two Commissioners. I think we should all be more than satisfied by Mr Patten's and Mr Verheugen's statements, including the factual information they have supplied. They have amply justified why Croatia can now be granted accession candidate status.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is this, and it has already been asked several times: what opportunities do the Commission and, indeed, this Parliament have to persuade the Council that it should grant this candidate status swiftly so that negotiations can be opened soon? I endorse the points made by Mr Lagendijk. Can we do anything to prevent the failure so far to sign the Stability Pact from being viewed as an impediment to the opening of negotiations? This is an important issue, and we would very much appreciate a response from one of the Commissioners.</p>

We are not in a position to make a judgment from our own knowledge and experience, and as Mr Patten has just said, we have agreed that the International Criminal Tribunal will be the referee on this issue and we do have a clear picture at present. Should this clear picture change in future as a result of statements by the Tribunal, this would impact on the process that we are initiating with Croatia today. That is understood, and that is why I reiterate that this cooperation with the Tribunal must be viewed as satisfactory not only on one occasion but of course on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mrs Pack's question, all I can say is that to my knowledge, the European Council plans to deal with this issue in June. However, that is a matter for the Irish Presidency. The Commission will not intervene in any way. We have timed the presentation of our report so that the Council has enough time to prepare itself before reaching a decision at the European Council meeting in June. In my experience, the European Council is always grateful for guidance and advice from the European Parliament. That is not meant at all ironically. Such guidance from the European Parliament would undoubtedly be helpful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have one specific question: are any efforts being made by the European Commission to assist the two countries of Slovenia and Croatia to resolve their border issue in the Piran Bay so that a solution can be reached here as swiftly as possible in a European spirit?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one further comment in conclusion, which refers back to Commissioner Verheugen's statements: we have duly noted that the Council is grateful for guidance.
