<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Richard Howitt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the job of the European Parliament is to scrutinise and hold to account the institutions of the European Union, yet every year since 1988 in this Parliament’s annual human rights report, we have scrutinised the record of governments across the world, but never asked the hard questions about what impact the EU itself has had in promoting compliance with international human rights law abroad. This year we are doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank colleagues from the Austrian Presidency who have agreed with us an enhanced role for Parliament, as the Council prepares its annual human rights report on behalf of the Union as a whole. This is not so much a question of institutional sensitivities: it is more that a unified and strengthened EU human rights report can provide a stronger voice for Europe and our commitment to human rights in the world. I hope our proposal for an annual EU list of countries of concern will be considered in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commissioner, too, for her support for this approach and for listening and responding to Parliament by agreeing to a separate legal instrument for human rights. This will allow us to continue funding human rights projects, despite opposition from governments responsible for oppression and abuse. It is the right choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course Parliament will, this year and every year, offer constructive criticism. Why does the Council support UN reform which puts human rights onto an equal footing, yet itself have a part-time working group, compared to other foreign policy working groups which are staffed by permanent Brussels-based officials? Human rights are not a part-time occupation. When UN troops in Liberia stand accused of rape and torture, how can Europe launch its own ESDP mission in Aceh, Indonesia, without any human rights monitoring? Why do the EU’s human rights consultations allow Russia to exclude human rights NGOs and why does our human rights dialogue with China not even benefit from simultaneous language interpretation? And does Europe really apply human rights consistently when it fails to support criticisms of the abuse in both China and Russia, but is prepared to do so for less strategically important countries like Nepal or North Korea?</p>
<p class="contents">Explain to the families of 99 trade unionists murdered last year in Colombia, which has the worst record in the world, why Europe actually offers trade preferences to that country for its supposed protection of internationally agreed workers’ rights. Why have nine Member States, including Germany, Ireland, and Portugal, failed to sign the UN optional protocol against torture? Eleven EU countries refuse to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, including Britain, France and Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have seven of our members considered signing so-called immunity agreements in opposition to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court? When human rights defenders face death threats for upholding their rights, how can evidence show that in Zimbabwe – scene of political imprisonment, mass evictions and the persecution of journalists – the European Commission delegation itself said that it was not aware of the EU’s guidelines for human rights defenders? We can do better.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stop the navel-gazing by EU representatives in international forums and, for the first time, genuinely link multilateral and bilateral negotiations in the EU so that abusive countries know they will face adverse consequences in the EU’s diplomatic trade and development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use a more sophisticated sliding scale of sanctions and make it easier to find political agreement in the EU to apply them. We should ensure that one staff member in every Commission delegation, in 118 countries worldwide, is responsible for reporting and promoting human rights obligations. We must make the UN and its international human rights conventions a contractual obligation of the stabilisation, association and accession process, starting with ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as we ourselves are concerned, let me refer to the debate raging this week in my own country, the United Kingdom, on how human rights can be reconciled, given the changed threats of terrorism, people trafficking and organised crime. It is time to say that the threats might change, but that human rights are inviolable.</p>
<p class="contents">When the last generation saw Nelson Mandela labelled a terrorist, when former East Germans smuggled themselves across the Berlin Wall, when the Holocaust represented one of the worst ethnic genocides in world history, the threats of terrorism, trafficking and racial hatred were a cue to agree human rights, not to tear them down. So if our generation is sincere in seeking the freedom of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi, tackling the despicable trade in women and children for sexual exploitation and bringing the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Darfur and in the Balkans to justice, we have to defend the concept of human rights at home as well as abroad. Europe must practice what it preaches.</p>

As far as the Austrian Presidency is concerned, this issue is very dear to our hearts and we want to deal with it in a way that corresponds to what the rapporteur has just said. We want the European Union as a whole to be perceived by our partners and by the outside world as speaking with one voice and conveying the values of the European Union. As Mr Howitt said, we have to practise what we preach. This is very much what the Presidency is trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by thanking the European Parliament for its cooperation and we should also like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission for their contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are grateful this year that, for the first time, Parliament has adopted a comprehensive approach. It has not just listed one human rights violation after another in a given country but has adopted a comprehensive approach and policy, which the Council very much appreciates. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> To those – be they women or men – who are threatened and tortured for standing up for human rights, it is irrelevant whether the European Union now speaks through Parliament, the Council or the Commission. The important thing is that we in the European Union should speak at all. People who rely on help from the European Union do so irrespective of the institution, and that is why cooperation between the institutions is so very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, at this point, to make reference to something that is very important to me personally, even though it may well not be directly connected with the report. The Austrian Presidency is endeavouring, if at all possible, to set up the Fundamental Rights Agency, and to bring about a final agreement on it, before our presidency comes to an end. We had, this morning, a highly constructive sitting with Parliament and the Commission, in the course of which we agreed on the basis outlines of what this Fundamental Rights Agency is going to be like. I would ask you all to play your parts in this, in order that this important institution, which is to represent the European Union as a whole to the outside world, may take concrete form as soon as possible. The Presidency will be working very hard to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">We have closely examined the report, and we are appreciative of the efforts of the rapporteur and of all the Members of your House who worked on it. I would just like to give particular attention to a few points. The first has to do with the human rights guidelines, which the report quite rightly emphasises, and which is of great significance in terms of the more effective implementation of EU policy. At the heart of all that we do is the worldwide abolition of the death penalty and of torture, along with the protection of human rights activists and of children caught up in armed conflict, and I would like to mention the fact that Austrian foreign policy over recent years, not least under the aegis of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner – who is now a Commissioner – focused particularly on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome your House’s work, in particular that of the Human Rights Sub-Committee, towards the better implementation of the anti-torture guidelines and also your time-honoured commitment to the prevention of human rights violations. The present Austrian President of the Foreign Affairs Council, Mrs Plassnik, takes these matters extremely seriously; in the run-up to the summit between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean, she received human rights campaigners from that region and assured them of the European Union’s support.</p>
<p class="contents">Passing on to the subject of the anti-torture guidelines, we repeatedly hear it said that the European Union does not do enough in individual cases. We are of course well aware of the fact that whether or not people detained in police custody are treated humanely is often something that is determined within hours, and, true though this is, we must also be honest with ourselves and admit the regrettable fact that our options are often limited. Within the scope afforded by those options, the European Union does speak out very strongly in cases where people face the threat of torture and inhumane treatment, but we regret our inability to prevent them in every case.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture, and cooperation with the UN’s human rights apparatus generally, was, during our presidency, an essential part of our human rights policy; in this respect we were doing no more than continuing the European Union’s traditional policy, and initiated démarches on the subject in over twenty-five countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of torture and inhumane treatment is of course an important one, and it is one that we keep on raising in our human rights dialogues with third countries. Having visited Kazakhstan, where we engaged in political dialogues with the countries of Central Asia, and more recently, the region of the Southern Caucasus, I myself can say that the European Union has always been very forthright in addressing the issue of torture and inhumane treatment, as well as human rights matters in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections to the UN Human Rights Council were held a matter of a few days ago, and I am sure that we can generally be satisfied with them, since it turned out that certain states who are notorious violators of human rights were not elected after all, and the European Union had in fact given an undertaking not to vote for countries known to have a poor record on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Human Rights Council will meet for the first time on 19 June, in other words, before the end of our presidency. Our desire is that this new United Nation body should, in future, make a constructive and essential contribution to working for human rights around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like once more to emphasise the great importance of exchange between the institutions in terms of our work for human rights. Only an even-handed and universal human rights policy on the part of the European Union will get a hearing and, eventually, bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">The presentation of the European Union’s annual report on human rights to your House in December, an occasion on which you traditionally highlight human rights priorities by presenting the Sakharov Prize, and your House’s response to that report, makes an important contribution towards that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Our common goal is an effective and visible human rights policy for the European Union, which will see us standing up for our values. The European Parliament is making a significant contribution in this respect, to which tribute was paid in the European Union’s annual report for 2005. The European Parliament’s achievements should and will receive due recognition in the forthcoming annual report, which will be prepared under the Finnish Presidency. I would like, once again to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this outstanding report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity for a human rights debate. I thank Mr Howitt for his excellent report. I also welcome the comprehensive analysis of action. As the President said, both the Commission and the Council have to work very closely together in order to have a comprehensive human rights policy. Let me make a few comments and raise a few issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I acknowledge the strong support of Parliament for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and its continued interest. I assure you that all the elements that contribute to the success of this initiative will be maintained for the period 2007 to 2013, for instance independence from government approval and support for civil society organisations. I share the concern to make our actions in the area more flexible and in tune with the needs of the grassroots organisations. This year we are already trying out concrete improvements in our procedures, notably in the calls for proposals. We also need to better adapt the programme to the sensitive situations and restrictions often faced by civil society organisations. I will certainly continue to rely on your support to carry through those changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am grateful for the recognition of the effectiveness of the EU election-monitoring activities. They clearly demonstrate the commitment of the European Union to the democratic process and the sustainable resolution of conflicts. That is clearly reflected in the significant increase in the number of observation missions over the last two years, particularly in post-conflict and transition situations. The professional and independent approach of EU electoral observers is highly regarded and enjoys credibility and leverage. I am sensitive to the need to ensure that any further increase in that area does not squeeze resources from other priorities and I can assure you that I will do my best in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I welcome your positive comments on the human rights work of the EU in multilateral fora. Great efforts go into consolidating EU positions in such fora, which are often instrumental in achieving progress. As the President has already said, that leadership role of the European Union was clearly visible in the negotiations establishing the Human Rights Council. I should like to pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency, which capably steered through somewhat difficult waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that elections to the Council have taken place, the real work of this new body at the helm of the international and human rights system begins. I am confident that it will prove more efficient than the old Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I should like to pay tribute to the work leading to the report on gender equality and women’s rights. The mainstreaming of women’s as well as children’s rights remains a priority for this Commission and for me personally. The ongoing work on a comprehensive communication on children’s rights encompassing the internal, as well as the external, affairs of EU action is testimony to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the recommendations made by the rapporteur on the format of this and future reports. I hope that it will be possible to make the 2006 EU Human Rights Report a truly interinstitutional report. In that respect, my services have already suggested to the Member States that, as suggested by Parliament, the 2006 report should include a section on human rights guidelines, more emphasis on the use and impact of human rights clauses, and it should also aim to cover the activities of all three institutions – the Council, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That should not in any way be interpreted as impinging on the prerogatives of Parliament to scrutinise the work of the Council and Commission. But there will be space and need for a separate report by Parliament on the European Union’s human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Howitt that a reinforced effort should be made by the European Union as a whole to address human rights concerns more systematically and to mainstream human rights considerations in EU policies. In that task, cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is crucial. You can be sure that we are a partner in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we pointed out in our opinion attached to the report, we believe that the international legislation supporting and protecting women's rights should systematically become the cornerstone of all bilateral relations, particularly in the case of third countries with which the European Union has signed association and cooperation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, since the Summit between the European Union and Latin America has just taken place, we wanted the report to condemn the dramatic phenomenon of feminicide, which consists of torturing and killing women merely because they are women, and to highlight the need to put an end to the impunity relating to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to point out that we have noted once again that women are the main victims of armed conflicts and, at the same time, from a positive point of view, we must stress the crucial role they play in terms of building peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to thank the chairmen of the various groups for that. It is recognition of the importance of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, we have a very different report, in style and in content. We are essentially undertaking an experiment. Parliament has agreed to change the format of its human rights report to have a much tighter focus on issues where the EU has a direct impact or influence and to focus on EU human rights policy, in particular on guidelines that have been set out and the performance of the three institutions in implementing those guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing this on the understanding that the Council will work closely with us to produce a common and unified human rights report for the EU. That report will provide the general assessment of human rights across the globe and of many of the broader questions and challenges, as well as the more local challenges. In the past, as you know, Parliament and the Council have both essentially duplicated each other’s work to a certain extent by producing similar reports. Certainly, as rapporteur last year, I saw a huge amount of duplication between the report produced by Parliament and the one the Council produced.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the Council does not significantly consult and include Parliament when putting its report together in the coming year, we will have to revert to our previous approach. I appeal to the Council, therefore, to make the new formula work so that we can have a common, strong, unified human rights report, representing a European view on human rights, that we can send to all corners of the world. Parliament can then focus on the job that it was elected to do: assessing the performance of the Council and the Commission on behalf of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to congratulate Mr Howitt on doing an excellent job this year under new and different circumstances. The fact that we only have 14 amendments to the report tomorrow is a reflection on the work he has done. I can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At a time when the great debate is security – and there is no question that security is a great issue – our fears must not lead us to question our basic principles in terms of human rights. There can be no European political project without making human rights a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Lowering our guard in terms of human rights – and that may be what we are doing – means surrendering democratic standards and the European Union’s greatest values. We cannot permit this kind of double standard for the sake of <span class="italic">realpolitik</span>. Such double standards are unsustainable since they greatly harm the credibility of our democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">People suffering from persecution, torture, discrimination fear and death expect us to take decisive and coherent action to defend their rights. Furthermore, speaking with one voice within international bodies – as the Commissioner and the representative of the Council have said – defending human rights with the voices of twenty-five countries behind us, with the energy that the Union must apply at this time, will strengthen all of us and will at last make it possible for us not to have to go back to thinking, as we are at the moment, about what we call torture, what we call murder, what we call security and what we call the crucial defence of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an appeal in favour of more coordination and more coherence in the human rights policy of the EU and of the Member States. We all know that the rapporteur dreams of a single human rights report reflecting the viewpoints of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and that dream can, and will, become reality one day, provided that, in the short term, the Council takes Parliament’s advice seriously and in the longer term, places economic and commercial considerations second to the principle that human rights are universal and indivisible.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the rapporteur’s point of view that the European initiative for democracy and human rights is an extremely important instrument in the EU’s human rights strategy. I also share Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s view that more funds need to be set aside for election observation missions, which, certainly in post-conflict situations, are crucial in strengthening democracy and human rights. I also have high expectations of the inclusion of human rights clauses in all EU agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting up sound instruments is one thing, but applying them consistently and courageously is quite another, and so it is baffling that the Commission should continue to dither about applying Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement in certain cases of blatant human rights violation in ACP countries, of the sort that are, for example, currently going on in Ethiopia. A policy of double standards threatens to make the EU’s human rights policy less credible and should be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">What is so good about the Howitt report is that, in moving away from situation ethics, it finally offers a prospect of a more systematic and integrated approach. That is something I can support with a great deal of enthusiasm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, we will no longer have an assessment of the situation in countries, but a report on the Commission's, the Council's and Parliament's implementation of the EU instruments regarding the promotion of human rights and democracy. We achieved this result despite the difficulties involved. We can congratulate the rapporteur and the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s role consists in guiding, monitoring and assessing the policy of the Council and of the Commission. That is why it is crucial that Parliament continues to draft its own report. If we had to draft a report with the input of three different parties for example, we could not criticise a Member State's action – which we can take the liberty of doing with the current report – because all that that Member State would have to do is to veto it. The amendment to Article 8 that we have tabled is along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Howitt’s report presents a number of interesting and innovative proposals concerning the mechanisms for promoting human rights. The report specifically calls for qualified majority voting within the Council and for possible restrictive measures against a third country. It logically follows on from the report adopted by Parliament: the Agnoletto report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also proposes to ensure that the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, which has recently been set up, is not chaired by a State that is responsible for human rights violations. Furthermore, it proposes to implement a system aimed at keeping MEPs regularly informed of the actions carried out by the Council and the Commission. The report also stresses the need for cross-cutting human rights policies to be drafted within Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that the subcommittee proposed to allow the delegations to put forward candidates for the Sakharov Prize. The report refers to the violations of rights, or forms of intolerance, that are practised in certain Member States, to the use of torture, to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or to the banishment of people to countries that use torture, to the use of diplomatic assurances and to extraordinary rendition. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must establish a close link between the European Union's internal and external policies and perhaps contemplate having just one European Parliament report on human rights, drafted together with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as the issues related to asylum and immigration require. </p>
<p class="contents">As such, I reject paragraph 97, which in some ways supports the implementation of the pilot Regional Protection Programmes. The Commission plans to implement one of these initial programmes in Belarus, a country responsible for numerous human rights violations, which maintains no diplomatic relationship with the Union and which offers no guarantee regarding the protection of migrants. These programmes do not seem appropriate to me.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first, significant difference of this report comes in the shape of a request for subsequent annual reports to include an assessment of whether the democracy clause, which was adopted on 14 February, is actually being complied with. I must point out, however, that neither the Council nor the Commission has given any precise indication of the way in which it intends to incorporate that human rights and democracy clause in the commercial dealings between Europe and third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the fledgling UN Commission for Human Rights, the document to be voted on calls on the European Union to support the activities of that body and, at the same time, promotes the universal ratification of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court, especially on the part of the United States, for which no legal exception can be made. The document in question also specifically condemns the bilateral agreements that a number of EU countries have drawn up with the United States for the purposes of guaranteeing impunity to US soldiers. Lastly, it calls on the European Union to take a consistent approach to human rights, in the specific cases of China, with regard to the Tibetan people, and of Guantánamo, on the subject of which it calls for the immediate closure of all of the detention centres.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I cannot fail to mention some shortcomings of the report too. It does not in fact make any reference to the European Union’s failure to commit itself to supporting human rights on the occasion of the sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong. On the subject of Iraq, moreover, Article 38 is too vague: it does not criticise the human rights violations carried out by the occupying forces, or the use of illegal weapons such as, for instance, the white phosphorous used in Falluja.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of Colombia, Article 41 is not as explicit as the situation of the Latin American country's citizens would, on the contrary, require, such as in the case of the residents of peace communities who have been affected by countless massacres where the perpetrators have gone unpunished. The report fails, in fact, to firmly condemn the climate of violence in the country and to acknowledge a correlation between this situation and the recent legislative measures, such as the ‘Peace and justice’ law, which actually allow paramilitary forces to become part of the Colombian army.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final observation to make: although I support the request for the European Union's annual report on human rights to provide for the involvement of the European Parliament, I do, however, think it just as necessary that Parliament continues to draft its own specific report, with the aim of ensuring that Parliament monitors the European Commission's practical commitment towards human rights and of assessing that monitoring effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who based their wealth on the natives in their colonies for centuries on end? Who is talking about human rights? Those who, with a beer in the evening, enjoy the charms of some beautiful, poor, weak girl from the former eastern bloc? Who is talking about human rights? Those who support and coexist with dictators who torture their people in order to invade another country? Or is that not what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq? Who is talking? Those who turn a blind eye to what has been happening for three years now in Iraq? Who is talking? Those who accept Turkey in Europe, when a month ago they murdered a Catholic priest there, burned the effigy of the ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Christians and set light to the synagogues?</p>

<p class="contents">For a successful human rights policy it is essential for the EU Member States to implement a joint, consistent and visible policy in bilateral relations with countries that do not respect human rights. Our relations with Russia, as a strategic partner, are very important. It is therefore essential that in the report the Commission and the Council are requested to discuss violations of human rights in Chechnya during talks with Russia. In the report, hopes are expressed concerning the newly-created UN Human Rights Council. The election of Cuba, Nigeria and other similar countries, however, prompts concerns regarding the election mechanism and whether the Council’s work will be more successful than that of the Commission on Human Rights. The European Union must therefore systematically object to the allocation of the presidency to such countries and the Council must express the common EU stance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The request for the Council to identify those countries that give particular cause for concern in terms of human rights violations would have counted for something if, at the same time, it had produced measures against those countries; above all, if it had the courage to implement those measures against large countries too, such as China and the United States. We must certainly make respect for human rights obligations a priority in the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, and the same goes for the stabilisation and association negotiations with countries from the former Republic of Yugoslavia. The Commission must therefore demonstrate that no grey areas exist in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge the fact that the fight against trafficking in human beings, which underpins illegal immigration, particularly from eastern Europe, Africa and China, is now regarded as a priority that is widely shared by the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the concerns expressed by Mr Howitt on Iran – with reference to the first few months of President Ahmadinejad’s term of office – I frankly regard such concerns as simplistic and demagogic, in the same way that I regard the EU's supportive stance towards US policy in Iraq and the violations in Guantánamo as servile and counter-productive.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that a progressive scale of measures and sanctions to be applied in the event of a human rights violation should be defined as a matter of priority. Arrests on political grounds, the persecution of minorities, acts of torture and the repression of a person’s freedom of religion, speech and expression are acts that, wherever they take place in the world, require practical action from the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Again, that is included in this report. I am sorry, however, that my amendment on CIA flights was not accepted by the committee, but I note Amendment 5, which seeks to rectify this situation. It is very important that we include CIA flights in this report.</p>

As many of you know, I was Parliament’s rapporteur on that issue.</p>

Apart from a single suspension in the case of relatively insignificant Uzbekistan, these clauses might as well not exist, especially with regard to major economic forces like China. There it seems to some of us that the value of trade persuades the EU to do less than it could about flagrant breaches of human rights and instances of religious persecution. Indeed, one is tempted to say that such is the EU’s apparent awe of China that it avoided an opportunity during the year to sponsor a critical motion in the United Nations. Likewise, when it came to an opportunity there to join in condemning Zimbabwe for its mass forced evictions, the EU countries also avoided that issue.</p>

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, for his cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union continues to be leading in the world in the area of human rights, and of all the European Union's institutions, the European Parliament is the fiercest defender of human rights. The bad news is however, that Europe is much better at making declarations than it is at adhering to them. The Union is able to take up some sterling work on human rights, but in some strange way is unable to integrate decisions on human rights into its policies and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">If we sincerely cherish our values and want to defend them, this situation must change. I believe it is high time to identify the countries raising the greatest concern in each annual report, and thus develop an initiative facilitating the establishment of priorities. In order to provide short and concise information about countries which are prone to crisis and to trigger joint actions by the Council of Ministers and foreign ministers of Member States, the Council already has drafted the monitoring lists which are revised every six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Such information could be used to draw up the lists of countries causing particular concern with the aim of drawing special attention to them. It is also clear that significant improvements are needed in respect of the visibility and dissemination of the reports, especially amongst journalists and the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to draw your attention, Mr President, to a provision in the report which I feel is very important. I quote, ‘the European Parliament welcomes the choice of freedom of expression as a major human rights theme during the UK Presidency; is concerned at the high number of journalists worldwide being convicted for alleged defamation of public officials or politicians; asks the Council to advocate a worldwide moratorium on such imprisonment of journalists as a first step’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that in this context we, the European Parliament, must mention countries where the situation is particularly bad, that is, Cuba, Belarus, North Korea and the People's Republic of China. And this must be included in our resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tibet, as we know, was occupied by China, but for some reason we have recognised it as an inseparable part of China. China is committing genocide against the Tibetan people, but nowhere have we even mentioned that. The fact alone that each year around 3 000 children, and I stress children, escape to India via the Himalayas and Nepal just so that they can learn their own language, is worthy of notice. The Tibetan nation and its culture are being extinguished right in front of our eyes. For Tibetans even cultural autonomy is an unattainable dream, and negotiations about this between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and China are fictitious, as being conducted on the expert not on the principle level. </p>

For this, I personally thank him.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, we often speak of human rights in the abstract, in terms of well-rehearsed subjects and themes, but in this instance I should like to ask colleagues to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday abroad. You take a taxi journey to visit your friends and family that ends in tragedy. There are no witnesses, for the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first policeman you can find. You say he pulled a gun on you and what you did was in self-defence. This leads to a legal process which finds you innocent, then finds you guilty, then starts over again until every appeal is exhausted and you are ultimately condemned to death, with due legal process having been thrown out of the equation. All this takes 18 years; half your life on death row: a cruel life sentence in itself. This is not an abstraction. This is the tale of the rough justice of a British and EU citizen, Mirza Tahir Hussain, condemned to death on 1 June – his 36th birthday – a matter of days away.</p>

It is laudable that we are spending so much time here at the European Parliament on issues related to human rights in the broadest sense. During each Strasbourg session we hold debates on infringements of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while we debate the situation in African or Asian countries, we cannot forget about the Member States. Such problems affect a large number of them, and especially some of the new Member States. Let us therefore protect and fight for human rights throughout the world, but let us keep our eyes and ears open and remember that just next door, in a neighbouring state, they are not always respected. I say this with the utmost conviction as a practising lawyer who sees clear evidence of this happening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Greater institutional integration for the Union, political, not just technical, relations with the Council of Europe and a binding charter of rights: this is the basis of a European front that takes rights seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is today calling for all European political institutions to play their part in this master plan of spreading the sacred principles of humanity and the rule of law around the world. Europe cannot be an end in itself. The enlightened ideal at its core implies that it must take its crusade of rights around the world, and that it must have the courage to resist the temptation of <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>, because the politics of interested parties leads to uneven demands on the Member States in the area of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress the importance of concerted action on the part of the Union and all Member States on human rights, because on this issue there remain a great many contradictions that diminish the moral authority of the Union's political system in negotiations and weaken the impact of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union presidencies have a great responsibility to ensure that the human rights policies of the Union and its Member States are consistent across the board. A strong, concerted European rights policy would address the litany of horrors that, unfortunately, is not exclusive to underdeveloped countries. The death penalty, and even the exploitation of work that leads to company relocations, to give two very different examples, can only be combated with a tough concerted rights policy. Furthermore, an increasingly ambitious Europe in terms of military presence can only be an increasingly ambitious Europe if it has a culture of rights, a political Europe that has people at its core, because that is the nature of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the amount of human rights breaches taking place around us which are being addressed, and whether Europe is showing its teeth, is debatable. It is also very clear that many of the different institutions are giving the impression that they are acting alone. I am not referring to the Council, the Commission and Parliament, but, for example, to the banking institution. I think that Europe should use the power that it has. There is compatibility, and I believe that there should be collaboration between tackling the problems of human rights on the one hand, and economic power or the power of the assistance that Europe should provide on the other. I am aware that this is difficult. Nevertheless, I would like to conclude by referring to paragraph 14 of number 90, which states: 'welcomes the choice of freedom of expression as a major human rights theme'. I would like to mention this because in my country, Malta, two journalists, Daphne Caruana Galizia and Saviour Balzan, have just been the victims of arson attacks. I would like to express my solidarity with Maltese journalists against these attacks, which are a direct attack on their fundamental human rights.

The importance of human rights has not waned as the years have gone by; on the contrary, it has grown. At a time when trade between the EU and third countries has increased and the EU is involved in counter-terrorist activity, it is important to remember that human rights are not of subordinate importance or completely insignificant. Human rights are not subordinate to terrorism or active commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU can have a huge influence on human rights if it speaks with one voice. The EU has not always managed to do that, although of course it has sometimes. At present one would hope that the EU could concentrate more than it does now on eradicating hunger and poverty. Hunger and real poverty are among the worst violations of human rights right now in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, for the excellent cooperation that he has shown, and for taking into consideration the many amendments we have tabled. Furthermore, I was delighted to see that the rapporteur expressly emphasised the importance of the fact that the report resulted from cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.

First of all, the European Union should have an effective financial instrument along the lines of the American foundations that support those who fight for human rights across the world. The organisations and societies which often work illegally and which build and defend democracy, freedom of speech and respect for basic rights deserve our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, over the last 12 months, debates within the European Union institutions have centred solely on the creation of a new agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, which is supposed to deal with respect for these rights, but only in the Member States of the European Union. In view of this, I would like to quote paragraph 56 of the report, which ‘calls on the Commission to take seriously into consideration the position of the European Parliament seeking a specific human rights instrument for 2007-2013; looks forward to receiving the Commission's communication in this matter’.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the deplorable fact that the European Union refused to support the resolution on Chechnya at the 61st session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. Atrocities are carried out by the Russian army in Chechnya and between 3 000 and 5 000 Chechens have disappeared without trace. These were unarmed civilians who were detained by the Russians. The rapporteur is quite right when he states in his report that the attitude adopted by the European Union suggests that the Union is applying one set of rules in the case of small countries and a different set of rules in the case of larger ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue I wanted to mention is the critical situation of Christians living in Muslim countries. This situation has deteriorated in the last few months. The war in Iraq and the outrage sparked by the publication of the caricatures in European newspapers have created a state of constant danger for Christian minorities in the Muslim world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Globalisation is associated with a higher demand for fundamental human freedoms, but only if the opportunities it provides are utilised appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been thinking about the thoughts expressed by the President of the Republic of Greece today. Europe is the strongest bastion of humanism. It is important that we can continue to say the same in the future, to make this clear to the rest of the world, and to make it into an example to be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is an international player with a crucial mission to protect human rights, strengthen democracy and ensure that globalisation actually means the achievement of social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important for the European Union to insist on the enforcement of fundamental human rights in its relations with third countries. It must employ pragmatically the opportunities for political dialogue provided by foreign trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The strength of the report is that it warns us not to monitor compliance with human rights only outside of the borders of the European Union, because there is enough to be done in this respect within our own borders, too. The report can serve as a firm foundation to ensure that in the future we will not just accept statements regarding human rights, but we will also excel in complying with them and in ensuring their enforcement.

I think that criticism is necessary if we are going to make progress, but I have also noted, both in Mr Howitt's report and in this debate, some positive comments regarding our policies, for which I would thank you once again.</p>
<p class="contents">In a field such as the promotion and protection of human rights, the assessment is inevitably mixed. I should like to tell you how I see the situation. First, is the EU an important player in this field, which counts and is counted on? My response to that, without doubt, is yes. We have continually seen this demonstrated. Our state and non-state partners, both States and international organisations, are continuing to turn to us and to see us as a major player, and sometimes as indispensable, owing to our political credibility, our influence, our expertise and the instruments we have at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does the EU have the right tools to perform its activities? My response to that too is yes. We have access to international instruments as part of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, to name but two. We have the framework of our widely quoted bilateral agreements, including human rights clauses, and common political guidelines in many sectors, political dialogues and approaches of all kinds. We also have the financial, geographical and thematic instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, are we contributing and doing enough? To that, I would tend to say no, particularly if our actions are examined in general terms. If we look at specific situations, however, such as the adoption of the resolution establishing the new Human Rights Council or cases relating very specifically to countries and individuals, there are many instances where we made a difference. In any event, the EU, including the Member States, has certainly been the player that has made the most important contributions at global level and really has had a very strong presence, even though we are not always as visible as you or we would wish.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, is the human rights policy we are pursuing effective? Are we having an impact? For my part, I, like Parliament, should like us to increase our effectiveness and impact. To do so, we need to take a big step forward in quality terms, particularly in terms of consistency: consistency between the policy pursued at EU level and those pursued by the various Member States, and consistency between the EU's political will and the national interests that come to light at certain key moments in bilateral relations. And we need, in some cases, to create a better balance between our multilateral agenda and the bilateral agenda. We also need to mobilise all the institutions of the Union, including, of course, the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, we are very much in favour of a report drawn up jointly by the three institutions. Let us work towards this! Parliament can certainly count on me. Neither I nor my services will spare any efforts. You can count on us for the assessment and also the implementation of the human rights policy, even if we too are often faced with a political reality that is not easy to control. However, if we want to increase the impact of our policy, particularly by improving the consistency of our actions at European and national levels and between the various institutions, Parliament's annual report, like Mr Howitt's, must in my opinion be the inspiration for our actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A very large number of issues have been addressed in this debate, but, whether our concern is with human rights or with development cooperation, the fundamental question every time is whether we are doing enough, and the answer to that question is always ‘no’; there is always more that we could be doing. All of us – Parliament, Commission and Council – must be at all times capable of that sort of self-criticism, for whenever human rights are at stake, when people are tortured, when their rights are trodden underfoot – as they are in many countries – then what that means is that we, who are tasked with the defence of human rights, are not doing enough. That is why we need to give constant thought to how we could improve our performance, and what this debate has done is to help us to do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">A range of issues have been addressed, and I would just like to touch very briefly on one or two of them. It was said, and quite rightly too, how important civil society is in terms of human rights. Institutions of state and governments are particularly dependent on the cooperation of civil society and non-governmental organisations. Thinking back, for example, to our recent experience with the EU/Latin America/Caribbean summit, there was much evidence at it of civil society involvement in human rights matters, and both governments and parliaments had to take this very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights and good governance have an increasing role to play in development cooperation. I am sure we are all agreed – and this has become evident to me from my conversations with the Committee on Development Cooperation – that the deliberate promotion of good governance and human rights is a vitally important part of development cooperation. Mr Romeva i Rueda was quite right to mention, in this debate, the issue of violence against women, but I would like to point out that my colleague Mrs Plassnik will be devoting particular attention to this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Coveney said that the Council and Parliament should not duplicate each other’s work. I fully agree with that. Of course we must respect each institution’s individual role. That is what the three institutions must do. However, at the same time, we must cooperate where necessary in order to be more efficient. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr Agnoletto and others discussed the human rights clauses and raised the issue of whether the European Union, the Council and the Commission, should actually apply these clauses – which are to be found in a range of treaties – or whether we should do no more than apply ourselves to a sort of <span class="italic">realpolitik.</span></p>
<p class="contents">To that, I would like to say that I regard the human rights clauses as very important, in that they do not only provide for sanctions or for the suspension of treaties. Above all – and this is what strikes me as of the essence – they constitute a reason for engaging in dialogue with states, and this right to engage in dialogue, which we enjoy by virtue of the human rights clauses in the various treaties, is one of which we make use, and we do so irrespective of whether the states in question are large or small.</p>
<p class="contents">I can do no other than concur with Mr Vaidere, and say that we all hope that the Human Rights Council will be more efficient than the Human Rights Commission, for that was, after all, the reason why the European Union was so committed to it being set up. I would ask, though, that you should not, at this early juncture, even before the Human Rights Council has met for the first time, throw in the towel in the belief that the people elected to it make further improvement impossible. This is where a certain realism is called for, without losing a firm hold on the relevant principles. I do believe that the chances of the Human Rights Council becoming an effective instrument will turn out to be unaffected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and others stressed the European Union’s role in the World at large, not least in connection with the accession negotiations and the relationship with the Balkan states. I would like to point out that the Copenhagen criteria continue to be the most important factor in determining whether or not states can begin negotiations towards accession, that respect for human rights is a quite essential criterion even before such negotiations commence, and that it must – self-evidently – also be one while they are in progress. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne talked about trafficking in human beings. I fully agree that this issue is very important. I should just like to mention that the European Union cooperates closely in this respect with the OSCE, which is very active in this field. We should continue this cooperation and, again, there should be no duplication but rather a synergy effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne and others talked about the question of human rights in the European Union. Of course there are human rights violations in all European Union countries, including my own. However, what makes the European Union different from other regions in the world is that we have effective instruments to deal with human rights violations. All European Union Member States are also members of the Council of Europe and signatories to the Convention on Human Rights. There is the unique instrument of the Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, and within the European Union we also have the necessary mechanisms and instruments to take care of any violations. We should not confuse the situation within the European Union with that in other states where such instruments do not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mrs Esteves and others that there should be no double standards and that the credibility of the European Union is the most important thing. That is why I reject all allegations that we distinguish between small and large countries. I do not think we treat one country differently from another, which is important.</p>
<p class="contents">So, assuming I have understood the report correctly, I thank you all very much for the support the Council’s policy has received. Let us continue to defend human rights everywhere in the world and let us do so together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On countless occasions, this Parliament has come out in favour of improving living conditions and human dignity with regard to various situations that sadly continue to be under the gaze of international public opinion on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Much still remains to be done, however, if we are to turn our intentions into practical actions aimed at creating effective strategies to improve the international human rights situation. The EU itself must first of all ensure that European policies on external relations, international trade and development make this commitment one of their priorities and incorporate a human rights perspective in every activity that they give rise to. Consistency is also duly required between the Community’s actions and those carried out by each individual Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention must be paid to countries with which the EU has closer links: candidate countries – especially Turkey – and partner countries in the Neighbourhood Policy, and I am specifically referring to the Caucasus republics which, despite the significant progress they have made, still have many unresolved issues with regard to ethnic and religious tolerance and to freedom of expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our twin reports in Parliament on human rights in the world and human rights in the Union demonstrate the importance we place on this issue. Our consistent campaign against the death penalty, whether in the United States or China, Iran or Japan, is to be welcomed. My own Government in Britain was influential in pushing this forward during its Presidency last year.</p>
<p class="contents">My only criticism on this Foreign Affairs Committee report would be its unevenness in places and its over-reliance on third-hand reports. For example, Saudi Arabia barely gets a mention. The situation is that the majority of the population – its women – face vicious discrimination. Followers of all faiths, save its own peculiar form of Islam, face persecution and where torture and mutilation are rife. Equally, it reports persecution of journalists in North Korea. Yet as someone who follows the country closely, it is a complaint I have never heard. There is much rightly to raise with the Government of North Korea regarding human rights in the prisons and camps, plus the humanitarian situation in the countryside, rather than these blanket and unsupported catch-all allegations that do no credit to our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Constitution will represent a further, considerable step forward, by giving constitutional status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and by creating an independent European human rights protection system.</p>
<p class="contents">The increasingly intensive involvement of Europe in foreign affairs means that it can exercise an important influence on human rights when it speaks up as a unified body, and it can be a particularly influential player on international fora.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, too, shows that the current situation is mixed and contradictory. Although the European Union continues to be one of the main protectors of human rights in the world, it excels much more in issuing statements than in following them up, and in many cases it does not integrate or enforce human rights considerations in its other policies and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must welcome the fact that last year the European Union supported, as a priority, the abolition of the death penalty throughout the world, and it addressed intensively, among other things, the situation in China, Chechnya and Zimbabwe, as well as the consolidation of union rights in Iran and Cambodia.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important that during the negotiation of both stabilisation and association agreements, human rights are given primary emphasis, in the spirit of Copenhagen. I, too, advocate that compliance with United Nations and Council of Europe treaties – among the latter, for instance, the treaties on minority rights – are also given priority in contractual relations with candidate states and states participating in the Stabilisation and Association process.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that as the only directly elected body of the European Union, Parliament must play a leading role in the development of human rights, and it must ensure that the other European Union institutions also bear in mind human rights, at all times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is right to draw to our attention to the fact that while the EU is vigorous in promoting human rights, its efforts are largely confined to specialist and one-off representations. There is, sadly, a general failure by the EU to address human rights concerns systematically and continuously with respect to third countries and to mainstream human rights policy with respect to the Union’s trade, development, and other external policies with such countries. We need a common, consistent and transparent policy for dealing with abuses of human rights in third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
