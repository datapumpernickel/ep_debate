<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism proposes that plenary at last gradually but properly liberalise the railway market, with liberalisation to be completed by the year 2010. Only then will we achieve our common goal of shifting more freight from the roads on to the railways and, hence, of sustainable mobility within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">First I must thank the Commission, especially the Vice-President, Mrs Palacio, and the Finnish Presidency, without whom there would have been no common positions in the Council in December 1999. We are most grateful for that. But Parliament will defend the view in the codecision procedure that the positions taken do not go far enough in order to safeguard the long-term future of the railways. The Council wants to move one small step at a time. We take the view that it is high time, eight years after the completion of the single market, to set signals and regulate conclusively so that the liberalisation of the railway sector can be completed by 2010. This also fits in with what was said at the Lisbon Summit, where the Heads of State and Government pressed for further liberalisation of the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are our most important proposed amendments? First, we agree with the Council that, if the railway networks are to be used efficiently, only cross-border freight traffic need be liberalised for a special trans-European rail freight network. But we take the view that five years is long enough to show railways and their employees that they have nothing to fear from the liberalisation of the networks. We feel that railway undertakings should have access to the entire network of the fifteen Member States in five years' time, for both international and national freight traffic, and by 2010 for international and national passenger traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">This gradual liberalisation plan would give us a real common network in the European Union by 2010. In order to ensure that railway undertakings in all Member States also have real access to local networks in other Member States, we feel that there must be a strict, compulsory division between the management of individual networks and the provision of transport services by individual national railway undertakings. Experience over the past 40 years shows that, if infrastructure and operations are not separated, the national railway undertaking always reserves the best lines for itself, thereby denying other railway undertakings effective, non-discriminatory access.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the view that, if there is to be even greater use of the networks, legal entities other than railway undertakings, such as shippers and forwarding agents, should have the right to apply for and be granted licences to use lines throughout the Community. Liberalising the right to apply to use lines in all fifteen Member States by 2005 will do two things: first, it will take account of the role of shippers and forwarding agents, who need no encouragement to use the railways and, secondly, it will represent a further step towards the completion of the single market in the railway sector in that the railways' exclusive right to use the infrastructure will be somewhat mitigated.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor is the question of track charges. We take the view that track charges should be increased in the medium and long term in order to move towards the objective of covering costs. Only if the user pays, i.e. the railway undertakings also bear the cost of operating and maintaining the network, will it be possible to fund network operation and maintenance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Committee on Transport voted by a large majority to abolish the derogations for Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Great Britain with respect to Northern Ireland. We feel that, first, legislation should be the same in all parts of the Union and, secondly, even in geographically remote areas, which we of course all value, the principles of accuracy and clarity of costs and open access to the network should apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close by stressing once again that we can use our vote in Parliament tomorrow to give a signal. If we adopt the recommendation by the Committee on Transport by a large majority, we will have a real chance of reaching a compromise with the Council during the conciliation procedure which is acceptable to both the Council and Parliament, which goes beyond the common positions and which enables a real move to be made towards liberalising the railway sector, because we all want to strengthen the railways. We want to shift more freight from the roads to the railways, which is why we need a clear compromise with the Council. And we shall only get it if we adopt a clear stance here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one could be forgiven for thinking that the three reports under discussion today are in fact technical reports. But oh what emotions I witnessed when I reported on them in my group today, which is a good thing because a hugely important question is in fact at stake here: the question of how to ensure that the European railways gain in weight again in the future, not in the material sense, but as far as their importance is concerned, because what many people forget when they are busy opposing reforms is that, with the state the railways have got into, they are carrying less and less. Trains are still chugging round Europe, but there is less and less freight in their wagons and that is a state of affairs which we cannot tolerate. That is why I, why we all think, that a European railway sector needs to be developed and the Council resolution, the Council consensus, is really a minimum consensus; it does not satisfy us, even if we perhaps differ in our views on many aspects, such as how much further than the Council we should go.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have a lot of lost ground to make up, because in the past we have only had national railways. We talk about globalisation. All today's private-sector undertakings operate transnationally; only the railways seem not to have heard of this. So we need to liberalise and open up the markets and of course everyone has differing ideas as to how this should be done. Some think that the market is the invisible hand, the almost divine principle which should guide and control everything, while others think we should be very circumspect in liberalising the market and should only liberalise it where absolutely necessary. I think that our position, and my position, is that there is a middle way which will allow us to move forward, but it must be clearly defined; we must be clear as to how we are going to bring about the liberalisation of the market, whereby the railways must, of course, be given a chance to adapt to the new conditions one step at a time.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, competition is a way of increasing services, i.e. we need to get more traffic on to the railways, especially freight traffic, which is the real sore point, if we are to prevent railway services from shrinking yet further. So it is a gradual process, but a clearer and faster process than that planned by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the overwhelming majority of us takes the view that there should be a competition authority, a regulator as it were, in every country. That would give all railway undertakings, all interested parties, shipping agents, whoever, one authority in each country to which they can take recourse if clarity and transparency of competition are violated. It also means that there can be no derogations. We are building up a European railway, not one system for one country and a different system for another, which is why these derogations have to go. That does not mean that everything will be prescribed down to the last detail, it just means that the freedom which we are granting needs to be granted to all countries equally, not more for some and less for others.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have differing views on the compulsory separation of infrastructures. We think that it must also be possible to trade fairly with integrated undertakings, provided of course that the balance sheet and certain basic conditions are kept separate. Our, or my proposal is that the Commission should present a report in a few years' time and report to Parliament on whether or not the principles of free, transparent competition have been contradicted and then we can take another decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the view that liberalisation should apply first and foremost to freight traffic, both transnational and, in the end, national freight traffic. As far as passenger traffic is concerned, we feel that it is important and that it suffices, at least for the time being, to state clearly that cross-border passenger traffic will also need to be liberalised. As to whether passenger traffic between Stuttgart and Munich should be liberalised: this is a matter which, in my view, should be decided by the German government or the regional government in Bavaria and not necessarily at European level. We feel that the individual Member States should be given room to manoeuvre and take decisions here.</p>
<p class="contents">The pricing system is an important issue. How much should be charged for the capacity allocated? There are two schools of thought here. The first feels that only marginal costs should be charged, i.e. the costs incurred in running one more train. The second school feels that the complete costs of providing the route, tracks etc. should be covered. We feel that charging marginal costs make sense in the short term, in order to ensure that there is competition and that the railways can start running trains again. But in the long term, we will need some sort of complete cost-covering method, similar to the principle applied to the roads. Otherwise we shall never manage to get more freight back on to the railways because this is precisely the problem faced by certain railways, including the German railways, to quote just one example: when the complete cost-covering method is used in the present situation, many companies refuse to use the railways' services because they are simply too expensive. Which is why we need a gradual transition and similar conditions for both roads and railways.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention one last point. One criticism heard time and again is: has the whole idea of public-sector services gone to the dogs? Is everything to be run on market principles, on private-sector principles? We have therefore reinstated an original clause on public-sector services, and I am grateful for the support it has received because, unfortunately, the European Commission has not yet submitted any general proposals as to how public-sector services are to be dealt with. It will still be possible for a country to say that public-sector services must take priority at certain times and this priority can therefore be stipulated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that tomorrow's vote will set a conciliation procedure in motion. That does not present any particular problem. We, the two rapporteurs, and all the groups in the House are willing to reach a compromise. But the Council must also show willing. We have shown willing and, if the Council shows willing, we will be able to reach a compromise. I should like to close by thanking all those who worked with me, both in my group and in other groups here in Parliament, for all the effort which they invested in this, and of course the Commission, and I hope that tomorrow two or three very good reports will come out of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to say that they both explained the technical aspects of their reports extremely well.</p>
<p class="contents">As Chairman of the Committee on Transport, I should like to highlight two conclusions which I think we need to draw from this debate. The first conclusion concerns the liberalisation of the railways. This is something we have been hearing about for years, just as we have heard a great deal about the single market in the European Union for years. The time has come for action rather than words, on both counts. We need to accept that there will be no complete single market unless transport is fully liberalised and I think that liberalising the railways will be a decisive step in this direction and will make a decisive contribution towards the revival of the declining means of transport which we call the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message concerns the Council. The Council needs to take serious account of Parliament's views. Of course, we reached a compromise in Helsinki with Mrs de Palacio's help. This compromise is welcome but it is not enough; we need to go further and account needs to be taken of Parliament's position if we are to do so. The Council is wrong to believe that the discussion ended in Helsinki last December with the compromise at Council level. Parliament is here, it has its views, it supports them clearly and will, we believe, support them during tomorrow's vote which, I think, will confirm what was decided at the committee meeting during which the reports were adopted by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They either have to change or die. Railways in Europe are in terminal decline, not least in the rail freight sector. New freight goes by road in Europe, not by rail. That must change, and I believe it will. That is why I broadly support the Council position which represents a small but important step towards railway liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative to this modest step is no step at all. That is why tonight, regretfully I cannot agree with the tactics suggested by Mr Jarzembowski because it is a recipe for going nowhere at all, very quickly. We have to take into account national differences and indeed, social and employment concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Broadly, the Council position has struck the right balance on the charging, licensing, access and separation issues. They have struck a right balance between both extremes and I would advocate – to use Mr Swoboda's term – that "third way" should be applied to the railways in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Labour MEPs have two particular concerns which I know are shared by many other Members: one is the issue of derogations. We believe that Greece, Ireland and Northern Ireland should have a limited derogation of five years because of their unique geographical and geopolitical circumstances. Secondly, we hope that the deletion of Article 12, led by the Liberals in committee, which could deprive citizens and consumers of network benefits and deprive disabled people of access, can be reinserted into the text. Those basic safeguards must be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">The prize for us tonight is that for the first time in history we can achieve liberalisation of the international freight network. That is an achievable goal. Let us not throw it away.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Swoboda referred to this a moment ago: a vigorous railway sector within an internal market, which can be effective for the entire Union. The objective also sends a clear message to the Council, namely that Parliament wants to go further than the Commission. I do not really share Mr Watts’ view. In my opinion, we need to go further than the Council stated in its common position. </p>
<p class="contents">We must now set the scene for full liberalisation in the medium term, and the step we are now taking is the first step in this process. This step is also the step currently proposed by the Council. We must also take the next steps, namely implement full liberalisation with regard to the transport of goods by 2005 and take the same step for the transport of passengers nationally and internationally in the longer term, this time by 2010, a deadline which is ten years away. </p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of points which are vital in this context, and I hope that a sufficient number of MEPs will be able to support those opinions tomorrow. First of all, it is vital that infrastructure and the provision of services be divided. After all, no one can be on both sides of the fence at the same time. Secondly, who can apply for a licence? Not only railway undertakings, others too should be able to do this. I cannot see why, Mr Swoboda, this should be postponed until 2010. In my opinion, we should be able to bring this date forward to 2005. </p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to comment on Article 12, which, I believe, is redundant, and a European licence should be subject to European requirements. That is not to say that consumers, railway workers’ social rights or safety are deemed immaterial. In fact, safety should come first. European requirements should apply because a European railway system requires regulations at European level rather than additional regulations at national level, because the latter would enable Member States to carry out certain activities which they no longer have to do within a European market. If we pursue this line of attack, railway undertakings will need to put their customers and passengers first, rather than act out of self-interest. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add a brief, technical comment. Amendment No 23 has been declared inadmissible by the services. I would dispute this on the basis of Rule 80, paragraph 2 (b), and Rule 80, paragraph 3, of our Rules of Procedure. I would invite the services to reconsider their view, because my amendment is also related to Amendment No 24 regarding Article 12, which <span class="italic">was</span> declared admissible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Though we unanimously agree to finally and genuinely develop rail transport and, though we unanimously agree to make every effort to facilitate the transfer from road to rail, some think that that this will be achieved most speedily via liberalisation whereas others, including myself, believe that the maximum number of guarantees should be created before liberalisation goes ahead, particularly with regard to passenger transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the present state of the railways in the various Member States does not make it viable to open them up to competition. They are all in need of considerable modernisation in order to offer identical conditions of competition. The reason for this is that in order to achieve genuine and equitable competition, the right conditions need to be created, they are not simply acquired and excesses must be avoided. Companies, particularly public companies, need to be granted enough time to modernise their networks before opening them up to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the guarantees, be they in relation to the harmonisation of working conditions or vital safety regulations, they are also something that cannot simply be acquired. The disaster in Great Britain is still fresh in our minds and continues to warrant examination of rail safety requirements. The compromise reached on 10 December by the Transport Council marked a step in the right direction. Let us therefore go ahead and set up the rail transport network. It is not a matter of going too far, too fast in terms of passenger transport, what we firstly need to achieve is a rail network that offers the public the chance to get around without causing pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament has already paved the way for the liberalisation of international freight transport at its first reading, by granting authorised applicants track access rights. This rail package was the subject of a Council compromise in December. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council suggests that the choice of authorised applicants should be left to Member States’ discretion, that the freight rail networks be opened up using a specific network called the “Trans-European Rail Freight Network” and, lastly, that the division into separate entities only take place progressively. </p>
<p class="contents">I note, without any satisfaction, that the Council’s position also takes account of the various national situations and grants each State the right to determine their own choices and for example, to pursue cooperation commitments. However, we are faced with an ultraliberal proposition at this second reading. The amendments tabled sanction the overall fragmentation of the rail system, which would mark the end of subsidiarity for the authorised applicants in 5 years’ time and mean that the separation of entities would not be achieved progressively. It would also mean the complete opening up of international and national freight transport and, by 2010, of passenger transport. </p>
<p class="contents">Just a few moments ago we were speaking about electricity and on Thursday we shall address the issue of the single European sky. Throughout the public sector the same refrain is heard: liberalise, it’s magic! In my view, rail transport would be left with an enormous bill. Rail companies would be forced into the role of service provider, which would create unfair competition. While the service providers benefit from the largest part of the commercial margin and are free to choose the most profitable sectors, the rail companies on the other hand are left to bear the high equipment and personnel costs. </p>
<p class="contents">In opposition to the argument advanced regarding the increase in traffic, this system might cause the isolation and disastrous creaming off of the more profitable sectors. This same dogma is aimed solely at gaining profits through liberalisation, and users and employees do not get a say. No proper preliminary study was undertaken and what is more, I think that we should take time to study the impact of the decisions taken by the Council. It would also be useful to compare – in relation to the freight paths – the private and the public sector. </p>
<p class="contents">If the proposals from this second reading are adopted, they would be considered as a real provocation by all involved in the sector. I can neither endorse them, nor the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group that suggest a need for further opening up on the path to liberalisation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If these plans go ahead as they are, then it looks as if the next couple of years will see little in the way of improvements within the Union’s railway industry. I would therefore like to make some observations with regard to the railway sector’s critical state. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the speed at which the EU-wide railway sector is making headway is far too slow, both in terms of transport of people and goods. This is why it is necessary for measures to apply to the two sectors and the entire Union. History has taught us that excessive interference by governments has hampered the necessary flexibility. The continued protection of certain segments of the market – both geographically and sectorally – is not an option either, because this would not break the downward trend. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, some improvements are needed within the sector itself as well. A number of railway undertakings are still fostering close links with their national governments, due to historic factors. A division of tasks is necessary in order to prevent the unfair treatment of different economic operators. It is therefore important to keep the management of the infrastructure and the execution of transport services strictly separate, and this division should not just exist on paper. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this sector would also benefit from transparency and decisiveness. We should avoid building complex structures around tasks emanating from regulations within the sector. The fewer bodies involved, the better. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Monitoring System, therefore, adds little in the way of value and, if anything, threatens to obscure the view. </p>

This is necessary for the long-term survival of the European railway sector and all Member States would be in agreement with this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our task to reach agreement on how best to achieve this, bearing in mind the difficulties involved for some Member States. I speak for my own country of Ireland. Both the Republic and the North of Ireland seek to continue the derogation agreed in December 1999, because of geographic and geopolitical reasons. It is a small country isolated from the European mainland. It cannot be accessed by rail operators elsewhere in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen at first hand the continual bombings of the north-south railway lines over the past 30 years due to the Troubles. Only now is there a chance for them to develop and prosper. Implementation at this time of this rail liberalisation package will involve the setting up of a complex administrative structure without enjoying the subsequent benefits that other Member States would. I am sure that the Irish government has agreed to the broad principle of the separation of infrastructure and operation and has pledged to pursue the restructuring of Irish railways to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask that the present derogation be maintained to allow time to implement these changes remembering that, should an EU-rail operator wish to enter the Irish rail market, the derogation would immediately cease. Finally, it is my personal hope that while I support this derogation, I hope that it would in no way hinder the much-needed upgrading and extension of the Irish rail system.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Between 1990 and 1997 the volume of transport of goods increased by 21% whilst over the same period the proportion of freight transported by rail dropped by 7%. During the same period, passenger transport increased by 15% and rail transport by only 3%. In terms of both freight and passenger transport European integration has been a considerable factor of mobility, but the roads have been the major beneficiaries of this particularly, but not exclusively, due to the fact that they have been frontier free since the beginning of the 1990s. European railways therefore need to open up urgently and without fear. Their future lies largely in their own hands, however, it is also our job to give them every opportunity to achieve their aims. </p>
<p class="contents">Railway workers must rise to the challenge of opening up international networks to trains from all countries in the European Union. The decision taken by the fifteen Ministers for Transport in December 1999 to set plans in motion for the creation of a Trans-European Freight Network that represents 94% of the international freight transport came as a direct response to this challenge. It is entirely logical to adapt national rail legislation to this new system that lays down rules governing access, pricing policy and standard and consistent management practices within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swoboda report contains commendable proposals regarding the need to adapt legislation to the various national situations. On the other hand, it is wholly unacceptable and, what is more, contradicts Parliament’s first reading, for us to take advantage of this second reading – as the Jarzembowski report suggests – to announce measures to open up all networks to competition and others designed for the widespread privatisation of such networks at national and local level, as that stems from a dogma, an untested belief in the superiority of a market model that has clearly demonstrated its limitations in the United Kingdom. Several moments ago, I stated that the future of rail transport also depended on us, and I should also like to point out the fact that the dogmatic approach that we appear to have adopted in this matter threatens its very success. Everyone here is aware that rail integration in Europe cannot be reduced to a theological debate on the comparative merits of controlled liberalisation and uncontrolled privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Railways, which only receive 25% of the investment allocated to transport infrastructure in Europe, as opposed to the 65% allocated to roads, are in need of substantial investment in order to enhance interoperability, reduce bottlenecks, extend networks and integrated transport systems, etc. The United Kingdom has demonstrated to what extent privatisation can represent a step backwards. This is why we believe that our work should not threaten the delicate balance of the Council’s common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is vital, if we are to have a truly sustainable transport policy that this process is reversed.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski on their excellent reports which, if adopted, will make a major contribution to railway development. I share some of Mr Watts' concern, however, about Amendment No 1 in relation to the licensing of railway undertakings and the proposed deletion of the replacement Article 12. In any liberalisation process it is very important to ensure that certain standards are maintained, for example those relating to the safety of both workers and consumers. At the same time we need to prevent artificial barriers being put in the way of the opening up of markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Fulfilling both of these objectives requires a delicate balance to be struck. I doubt both whether Amendment No 1 serves its intended legal purpose and whether it could have the effects that Mr Watts fears. I believe it could send out the wrong signals. Instead I seek support for Amendments Nos 23 and 24 which, taken together, should have the effect of securing the second of the two objectives without detracting from the first.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could also give my support to the legal separation of the management of railway infrastructures from the provision of transport services. In order to do so, however, I would have to see guarantees on certain fundamental issues, which are the criteria for the quality and efficiency of the enormously important political and economic measure that should result from these directives. </p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that many European countries were not able to take part in the industrial revolution of the 19th Century at the right time, precisely because they lacked adequate rail connections. Some of them are still waiting today for their railways to be modernised and, more specifically, for access to the European High Speed Network. The liberalisation of this sector must under no circumstances be an obstacle to this access. Rail networks must therefore continue to provide a guaranteed public service in all Europe’s regions, particularly the more remote ones. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, liberalisation must not lead to necessary lines being closed, to unemployment or to safety standards and the quality of service falling.

I could not agree more. </p>
<p class="contents">But this is about the only issue on which I see eye to eye with him. I believe Mr Jarzembowski is quite mistaken. What he wants to achieve requires a complete change of tack and what he proposes will lead to further regression. His proposals are in line with views held at the end of the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="contents">In all areas, we are witnessing a neo-liberal attack on public services, Community undertakings and employers’ organisations. This attack is mainly aimed at postal services, rail and the energy sector, companies which have the potential to demonstrate that we can organise our economy in a more democratic, environmentally-friendly and less profit-oriented manner. Unfortunately, these companies have for years been neglected by their owners, the democratically elected community which belongs to us all, and have been treated as private companies. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur considers the rail industry as an irritating state monopoly with difficult and demanding trade unions in tow. He wants to break this monopoly as quickly and radically as possible. Instead of focusing his attention on stepping up cooperation between the existing railway companies and enhancing the democratic say over these companies, so that benefits of the rail industry can be better enjoyed on a European scale and liabilities can be eliminated more effectively, he puts all his hope in competition and liberalisation. In his opinion, the form of organisation by means of which road transport and aviation have largely triumphed over rail, should also be applied to rail itself. </p>
<p class="contents">We have now gained some experience in liberalisation thanks to the English and Dutch models. The English variant carved up the national railway industry into regional companies, some of which ended up in the hands of large foreign concerns. In other regions, they remained a monopoly. That country now invests less in innovation than any other country. Trains are shorter and overloaded, and the safety of railways has declined. </p>
<p class="contents">According to the Dutch version, competitors can obtain licences for lines on which they want to compete with the existing railway company. This company was established in 1939 and is an amalgamation of old private railway companies which operated inefficiently. Following a propaganda war between a newcomer and the existing company, operating different rates and using different trains, this newcomer was first taken over by a large French water company and subsequently ceased all activity. It is evident that it is only profitable to operate lines over which you have complete control. This reality renders the proposals made by Jarzembowski unviable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I were to read out his text, nobody would bat an eyelid. The train is at a standstill, and to stand still is to regress. Who in their right mind would take a train that moved backwards? </p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the internal market and <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce, the flows of traffic and commodities within the European Union have increased by 70% over the past ten years. To accommodate this increase, we need all the types of transport we can think of, ranging from internal waterways, air, roads and trains, all of which should be just in time and clean. </p>
<p class="contents">So far, trains have not contributed in any way. In percentage terms, the train has lost a considerable share in the transport market and it is difficult to detect any movement within European rail. At the same time, the train has proved the European Union right, namely that more competition keeps you on your toes and on the ball. Due to a lack of competition as a result of excessive protectionist behaviour on the part of the Member States, the train has been relegated to the second division in this century too. But from now on, the railways need to take down the barriers that are obstructing the cross-border transport of goods, by using each other’s infrastructure. They need to make their equipment considerably more hard-wearing because they are hopelessly lagging behind road transport in this respect. </p>
<p class="contents">In the next phase, the following points will be particularly important, in my opinion. Honest, non-discriminatory access should be granted to the infrastructure. Transport companies should be separated from the management of the infrastructure. It is vital for these components not to be controlled by one and the same body. Safety takes absolute priority and cannot be monitored by the transport companies themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">A second key element is the opening up of the railway infrastructure or, in other words, a liberalisation of the market, which is different from privatisation. This is vital if we want to breathe new life into the transport of goods. In this way, new operators are attracted who bring with them new insights and a new management culture. </p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation, as mentioned in the common position, is a good start but is not enough. Only when railway networks open up once and for all will railway undertakings and their employees have a chance. Liberalisation should, however, work both ways. Nobody should have to tolerate competitors on their infrastructure that refuse or are unable to grant the same access at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The congestion on the roads, the threat from which to transport and environmental safety increases daily, is so bad that we must now strengthen the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">The common positions approved here by the Council obviously promote the required revival by dealing fairly and transparently with all railway undertakings, by defining a logical framework for distributing infrastructure capacity and user charges, by separating railway infrastructure management from the provision of transport services and by discussing how, to what extent and at what speed this separation should apply. Of course we are on the right track and of course we understand the problems facing certain Member States in directly, or almost directly adopting all the new measures proposed. First, the huge disparities between the networks in the various countries and, more importantly, the geographical situations of certain Member States or regions make it very hard for them to change the system quickly and, secondly, forcing the change, as it were, on these Member States would not result in any significant benefit either to the countries in question or the Community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that a dogmatic, absolutist approach is risky and is unfair because, as we know full well, it does not apply in all sectors. Sometimes, the apparently contradictory, oxymoronic Ancient Greek proverb "more haste, less speed" is more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must in all honesty congratulate our two rapporteurs on their sterling work and ask for their understanding where special, objectively-identified circumstances exist. In this particular case, this applies to my country, Greece, which has shown that it is making quantum leaps, but only where they are really needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For all of these reasons the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance always defends the railway as an alternative means of transport – currently underexploited – which wastes fewer resources, and is cleaner and more respectful of the natural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, when amending and implementing the Community legislation on the liberalisation of the railway sector, we wish to argue not only that the railway should not be penalised in relation to other means of transport, but that there should actually be positive discrimination in its favour, so that we can counteract the delay we have caused in terms of investing in it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the taxes on the use of the infrastructures, which in the end will be paid by the users, we suggest that, in the short to medium term, these only reflect the marginal costs generated by the rail traffic itself and not those involving the recuperation of investment and maintenance, which should be covered by state budgets, as in the case of roads and motorways. That is the only way we will manage to make the railway a competitive means of transport which is used on a grand scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Either you are very famous or your correspondents feel very strongly about the matter on which they write. Members of the European Parliament are not very famous. It must therefore be the matter at issue which has triggered the correspondence. We have all received a lot of letters, documents and requests for interviews over the last few days, nearly all from representatives of national railways and nearly all warning us, <span class="italic">unisono</span> against the compulsory separation of management and infrastructure called for in the proposals by the rapporteur Georg Jarzembowski.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda has also addressed this issue, although his argument was that we need to liberalise, but only one step at a time. Georg Jarzembowski submits that our systems in the past, with quasi-monopolistic national carriers, have not allowed optimum use to be made of the system. Who can argue with that? The figures speak for themselves. Our present railway system is a far cry from what we desperately need in Europe, namely an efficient system which is also an acceptable system.</p>
<p class="contents">Every example in related sectors confirms the argument. One step at a time gets you nowhere. Telecommunications traffic has demonstrated that, the electricity sector and numerous other sectors besides have demonstrated that. And we expect the same to happen with the railways. The main purpose of the railways is to serve their users and hence to serve a more efficient, improved European transport system. That is what we want, that is what we need and that is what we shall vote for.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, we in the PPE are calling for this in all areas needed to complete the single market, wherever healthy competition can replace hand-me-down monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Only comprehensive liberalisation will allow the necessary progress to be made so that the railway, as a carrier, has the qualitative and quantitative capacity to provide services and integrate with other carriers. The Commission texts on developing railway undertakings, on licensing railway undertakings and on allocating railway infrastructure capacity are a step in the right direction in this respect. My fellow member, Georg Jarzembowski, has earned my unstinting support for his efforts to bring about a self-contained railway package and would like to thank him for his work and his excellent report. What is important to me in all this is that, when management and infrastructure are separated, investments in the infrastructure are examined closely and duly compensated. Liberalisation will only be accepted if it results in real advantages and consumers need not fear for their safety. From this point of view, we must be sure to keep a firm hold on strict conditions when licensing railway undertakings. As far as the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity is concerned, we must ensure that there is non-discriminatory access. I do not deny that flexible regulations governing access to the grid have caused a number of problems in the energy sector. But I still think it is the best market economy approach and that also applies to the railways. We should not just talk about a common Europe, we should have the courage of our convictions and do something about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is fashionable these days to talk about the railways; it is politically correct. It often feels as if Parliament is a chamber where there is just one permitted truth. We all dash along in the same direction, like a flock of sheep, trying to convince one another that the railways will solve Europe’s transport problems. It is hard for us politicians to admit the facts. I have nothing at all against the railways; on the contrary, I greatly enjoy sitting in the buffet car, having a beer and admiring the landscape as it flits past.</p>
<p class="contents">To be able to make reasonable decisions we have to identify the real importance of the railways for the economy and examine just how big a part the various modes of transport play. By far the biggest is road transport. The share of rail transport, measured in tons per kilometre, has fallen to below 15%, but even this way of measuring the figures gives too rosy a picture of the situation. From the economic point of view, transporting fifty computers a thousand kilometres is quite a different matter from transporting a hundred tons of grit ten kilometres, although the tonnage per kilometre is the same in both cases. It is also quite a different matter to transport raw textiles weighing tons as compared to an enormous load of silk neckties – I had one for myself, by the way. For this reason, any comparison must be made on the basis of the value of the consignments, and, if it is calculated this way, the share the railways have is just – surprise, surprise – 3%. I am not mathematically gifted, but I see a dramatic difference in favour of road transport, whose share is more than 95%. It is like comparing a fly with an ox, but it is not any wonder, because it is impossible to ignore the ease of transport, flexibility and door-to-door delivery service we associate with transportation by road.</p>
<p class="contents">At present the real role of the railways in Europe’s economy is, unfortunately, marginal, although they receive a good deal of assistance from the taxpayer. But it is just because of this that we have to do all we can to revive rail transportation and support its gradual opening up to competition. We expect a constructive contribution from France when we set the clocks of European railway stations to the new millennium.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted that Parliament is standing firmly by its convictions in this area, especially with regard to the full realisation of a railway transport market. Because what we are talking about, ladies and gentlemen, is not simply achieving fifteen juxtaposed national railway systems, but carrying out integration by means of a joint shared network throughout the length and breadth of Europe which will specifically allow the railway to function better.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been pointed out by the two rapporteurs – and also Mr Rack when he referred to the number of letters that he had received from different voters – although this involves some very technical issues, at the end of the day it is to a large extent a political issue. In this respect, it inspires passionate sentiments, as has been pointed out and as we have just heard a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that what is clear to most of us is that things cannot continue as they are: with closed public systems, which are national, confined within national borders, which are leading to a situation where the railway, day after day, is losing its share of the market in goods transport and in the transportation of persons as well, with the exception of a very specific form of transport, that is, high speed trains and suburban trains.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we must make a change, we must propose solutions which will improve the quality of the service, because that is the important thing for consumers and users. We believe that, if our first aim is to create a situation where a train can reasonably travel from Hamburg to Lisbon, the first thing we have to do is to see to it that that train can belong to a German company, a French company, a Spanish company, a Portuguese company etc. These may be public or private, nobody is questioning that, but it is obvious that, if we integrate the network, this automatically leads to an opening up of our market. So let us forget dogma, examples of which I have heard here tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to tell the two rapporteurs that I like their amendments very much. However, having said this, I will not be able to accept many of them, although I would have loved to have done so. I am going to tell you why, because I am one of those people who believe that the perfect is the enemy of the good, and that it is better to make progress than to reach an impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">To accept the amendments of both Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda, the vast majority of which correspond much more to the Commission’s initial proposal and to my own opinions on the whole, would mean disregarding a compromise which was reached with great difficulty in the Council, as you know, after long arguments, after long periods of impasse and stalemate on this issue, which kept us talking into the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to say that there is a margin, because Parliament is not being ignored – Parliament must participate in the creation of these directives – but there exists a fundamental compromise with the Council which I, of course, cannot disregard and you must understand this. That would be counterproductive in terms of what both you and I want to see, which is the promotion of improvements in the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that next year I am prepared to present an additional step, a different initiative, which may be accepted or rejected, both by the Council or by Parliament, when the time comes, and modified in its various fields, and which will also deal with certain aspects, at least with regard to the transportation of persons or, possibly, the transport of goods internally within the different countries, but which will be separate from the current package, on which we have reached a fundamental compromise – I insist – with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Before thanking the two rapporteurs on their work once again, which I know has been very complex – I fully appreciate this – but which I believe has been very important, and before commenting on all the amendments one by one, I would ask the rapporteurs and Parliament as a whole for a degree of flexibility, so that in the end we may achieve a conciliation – since I fear that we will have to go to conciliation, the way things are going – which will allow us to move forward with this package which has a key role to play in the future of the railway.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning specifically to each of the reports, after these general comments, and perhaps in order to clarify and not to prolong this debate any further, I would like to refer to amendments relating to the Directive amending Directive 91/440/EEC, whose rapporteur is Mr Jarzembowski. We could accept Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21 and 24. On the other hand, I must reject – although I insist that I agree fully with many of them, but cannot accept them – Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26 and 27.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6, 8, 9 and 11, which propose the separation of the operators of infrastructures from the providers of services, clarify the text enormously. I also consider it important to remove Article 6(4), which I believe could be a source of misunderstandings and, therefore, I particularly support Amendment No 8 and the corresponding corrections to the wording.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the directives which are the subject of Mr Swoboda’s report, with regard to Directive 95/18/EC, we cannot accept Amendment No 1, since Article 12 serves as a reminder that, as well as European legislation, there are national rules which must be respected – there is an element of national regulation which in no way disappears as a result of this regulation – and, nevertheless, we do accept Amendment No 24.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Directive 95/19/EC, there are key questions such as, for example – and Mr Swoboda and Mr Ortuondo have mentioned this – the issue of the establishment of tariffs on marginal costs or on total costs, in one case seeing it as a transitional period, in another, as a key element. I would like to say that, although I would perhaps have preferred other proposals, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 and 20; but we cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 21, 22 and 23.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would once again like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work and ask for flexibility, from them and from Parliament, so that in the end we may achieve a result, which must also be supplemented by the other directive, which involves the interoperability of the systems themselves, which would be a great step forward. There are perhaps some who want more, and others who want a little less, but I am sure that reality will prove us right.</p>
