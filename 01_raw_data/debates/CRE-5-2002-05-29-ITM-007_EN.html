<p class="contents">Following a long preparation period, the preparatory work having begun a year ago under the Swedish Presidency and continued under the Belgian Presidency, we must say that noteworthy results have been achieved at the summit, which are in line with the objectives set by the Spanish Presidency for this six-month period.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament knows, the slogan chosen for the summit was "The European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, promoting a strategic partnership for the twenty-first century", which I believe sums up what we are creating between these two geographical regions: a common area and joint action in the international field between two regions of the world which share principles and values as fundamental as democracy, the Rule of Law, respect for human rights, equality between men and women, the market economy, rational thinking and many others which form the foundation of what we understand to be the western world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the preparatory meetings had grouped the issues for the summit into three areas: political dialogue, economic and trade cooperation and cultural, educational and social cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The working sessions conformed to these three areas, including the following points, introduced by different countries: the political session dealt with the strengthening and modernisation of the State, cooperation in the fight against terrorism, cooperation in the fight against drug-trafficking, multilateralism and the promotion of democracy, human rights and the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">The session on social policy and cultural and educational cooperation dealt with cultural diversity, the danger of technological backwardness, education, equality and social cohesion, sustainable development and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the economic session discussed the international financial architecture, bi-regional trade, international cooperation for sustainable development and development funding, measures to stimulate economic growth and development and, finally, regional integration processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there was a working lunch with the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the Inter-American Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, next I will tell the House what the Presidency believes are the most important results of this summit in the three areas I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the political field, there have clearly been significant results such as the firm commitment to fight terrorism and drug trafficking which threaten the whole world, and to this end to strengthen the mechanisms for cooperation between governments. Secondly, strengthening bi-regional political dialogue through agreement within international fora, in particular the United Nations. This agreement will allow those of us who share the same principles and values to deal with the main issues on the international agenda. In this respect, it is absolutely justified to renew the commitment to cooperate in the strengthening of the democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on the second aspect, in the economic and social field, that there have been more considerable advances in comparison with the situation resulting from the first summit in Río de Janeiro in June 1999. On the one hand, the entry into force of the Agreement with Mexico, which has had a very positive impact on commercial movements between the European Union and Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – and this is undoubtedly the most important thing – the signing of the association agreement with Chile. All the participants have indicated the great importance of this act following complex and sometimes difficult negotiations which will lead us, as was the case with Mexico, to a privileged relationship with direct social and economic benefits for Chile, but which will go beyond that country and send a message of trust to the whole of Latin America at this time of economic uncertainty, in certain sub-regions in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mercosur, there has been progress in the negotiation, of which the political chapter and the chapters on cooperation and the promotion of trade are practically concluded. Furthermore, it has been agreed to continue commercial negotiations with a ministerial meeting in July, which will give impetus to the negotiation despite the adverse circumstances resulting from the situation in Argentina.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Central America and the Andean Community of nations, we have managed to open the way to the possible negotiation of association agreements with both regions. Meanwhile, agreements on political dialogue and cooperation are being negotiated and cooperation in the field of trade, investments and economic relations is being strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention of all of this is to prepare the ground so that, once the Doha Round is completed, association agreements with these two Latin American sub-regions can be negotiated. In view of the experience with Mercosur, it is essential that we strengthen both integration processes in order to promote the agreements we all aspire to.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell Parliament that the Central Americans have accepted this formula to a large extent, although they would have preferred a more precise timetable that began following the Madrid Summit. The Andean Community has expressed less satisfaction with the agreement reached although they recognise that the formula obtained opens the door to a future association agreement which will replace the unilateral concessions they currently receive through the system of generalised preferences relating to the fight against drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end my comments on the different geographical areas by mentioning the decision of the Caribbean countries, together with all the ACP countries, to begin negotiations next September for the economic association with the European Union within the framework of Cotonou.</p>
<p class="contents">As we can see, these decisions and agreements have a broad perspective, creating fluid and intense relations between the two sides of the Atlantic in the not too distant future which, as I have said, will benefit the societies of both America and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight three more issues in this economic field: the decision to cooperate in the eradication of poverty through, amongst other instruments, the strengthening of institutions. Important decisions on this and its consequences were taken at the Monterrey Conference in March, which appeared in its final document known as the Monterrey Consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the creation of better conditions for development and macroeconomic balance, an effort which will involve both the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Investment Bank. Both institutions will thereby be incorporated into the process of strengthening the strategic partnership with all their experience and resources, which is a considerable innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth mentioning the support for the introduction of the euro, acknowledging its positive effects, as both the Council and the European Central Bank have done at the Madrid Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also new elements of interest in the field of cooperation. I will mention the following: the ALIS programme for the development of the information society, a four-year programme which will receive EUR 85 million, of which the Commission will provide 63.5 million and the Latin American countries will provide the rest, until that figure is reached. Although the Commission will be able to provide more information, I would simply like to point out that included in the objectives of the programme are the normalisation of the regulatory framework and the interconnection of networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of education, which the summit has paid particular attention to, the new ALBAN scholarship programme is of particular importance. This programme was presented by the Commissioner responsible for External Relations, Mr Patten, within the framework of the Cultural Forum which ran parallel with the summit and brought together cultural foundations and bodies from European and Latin American countries. The programme consists of the funding of – 3900 grants for postgraduate studies, to be provided by the Commission – EUR 75 million – and the European universities participating in the programme – EUR 38 million. I believe that this is a milestone which deserves to be highlighted since it will decisively promote educational cooperation between Europe and Latin America and will allow for the highest-level education for Latin American postgraduate students, with all that this implies in terms of aiding the development of these countries and overcoming the almost unilateral relationship between these societies and the United States of America. I believe this is a very significant programme, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission for the work it has done through Commissioner Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention the support which the summit gave to the 2002-2004 Action Plan in the field of higher education with the objectives of improving the quality of education and facilitating the mobility of students.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the second European Union/Latin America and the Caribbean Summit has taken place within a none too favourable international context, on either side of the Atlantic. In fact, as well as the economic difficulties resulting from 11 September, difficult situations in several South American countries – the particular situation in Venezuela a month after the serious crisis in April, the peace process interrupted in a climate deeply affected by the unacceptable terrorist violence in Colombia, the profound crisis in Argentina – all of this added to the European preoccupation with enlargement and the various elections taking place at the moment in certain European Union countries, did not appear to offer the best possible climate for the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Madrid Summit involved a very large number of participants, achieved very noteworthy concrete results and has been very positively assessed by the participants and, in general, by public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the agreements and decisions adopted at the summit, included in a political declaration of 33 points known as the Madrid Commitment, a new phase in our bi-regional relations has begun, which is an important step in the process of consolidating the strategic partnership. The scheduling of the next summit in Mexico in 2004 guarantees the continuity of this process of strengthening and consolidating the bi-regional association. To that end the commitments made in the Madrid Declaration must be suitably followed up so that the Mexico Summit may represent a significant new step in this process of alliance between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, a process which has always been promoted by this Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, honourable Members, when my colleague, Commissioner Patten addressed you a fortnight ago regarding the Commission's preparation for the Madrid Summit, he specifically highlighted the need for the partnership between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean to be a credible process and for the summit to produce concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, with the summit behind us and after the very comprehensive account that the Presidency has just presented to you, I can confidently say that we have succeeded in our aims. Madrid clearly proved that the bi-regional partnership we established at Rio is much more than just another talking shop. Today my aim is not to provide you with an in-depth analysis of the three principal documents that the Madrid Summit produced, the Presidency has already discussed this issue in detail. The already widely available documents are, as you know, the political declaration, the common value and positions paper and the assessment report on our progress since Rio.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw your attention to the fact that the assessment report clearly stresses that the European Commission is most probably the most active institution in promoting the concrete implementation of the strategic partnership between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of Commission Patten, I would like to pick out the most important points to come out of the summit. The fact that heads of state and government from both regions confirm their conviction that multilateralism is the best way to handle the problems and challenges that face the world today. Both parties have rejected unilateralism in political and trade matters and have committed to joining forces and promoting a common vision on these significant issues within the framework of multi-lateral mechanisms. This represents a strong commitment which will help us to move the partnership forward on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is particularly satisfied with the outcome of the meetings and events that took place in the context of the Madrid Summit. Firstly, we were able to successfully complete the European Union-Chile negotiations in due time to allow Mr Prodi, Mr Aznar and Mr Lagos to announce the official conclusion of the negotiations and the establishment of our much awaited association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Madrid Summit provided an occasion for the European Union and Mercosur heads of state and government to note with satisfaction the progress made by the bi-regional negotiations committee towards the establishment of an inter-regional strategic association. They also agreed on a new mechanism for their meetings with greater frequency, so as to strengthen and deepen the EU-Mercosur political dialogue. Furthermore, a ministerial meeting will take place hopefully next July in order to provide impetus for negotiations of the trade chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the demands of both the Andean Community and Central America, for the opening of negotiations towards association agreements with the EU were also answered adequately at Madrid. Significantly, a decision was taken to negotiate political and cooperation agreements with both regions. It was also decided to strengthen cooperation on trade, investment and economic relations. These three initiatives should establish the conditions under which feasible and mutually beneficial association agreements, including FTAs could be negotiated between the European Union and both regions. Evidently, these will have to build upon the outcome of the Doha work programme which we have committed to complete by the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the 18th Ministerial Conference of the San José dialogue held on the periphery of the Madrid Summit, decided on a renewed agenda and on a new format for the political dialogue. The Commission shares the view of our Central American partner that it is necessary to keep alive the particular nature of the San José dialogue. The outcome of the Madrid Summit shows that the bi-regional strategic partnership is now well under way. Certainly the Spanish Presidency's hard work played a key role in ensuring the success of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is particularly focused on the need to lead the EU-Latin American-Caribbean partnership in implementing new concrete bi-regional initiatives. In the field of education, the Commission has just launched a brand-new scholarship programme, ALBAN, which will allow 4 000 Latin American postgraduate students to complete their training in Europe. The existing bi-regional programme for SMEs exchanges, AL-INVEST, will be renewed on the basis of its success. The ALIS programme has recently started to function and pilot projects in the information society field should soon be put into place. Additionally, we are currently working on the design of a new social initiative by fostering contracts between administrations and the programme aimed at disaster prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we look forward to working with Member States and coordinating our initiatives with theirs in order to better implement the bi-regional partnership. By the time the next EU Latin American-Caribbean Summit takes place in Mexico in 2004, I hope we will be pleasantly surprised by how much progress has been made in the six short years since the launch of the strategic partnership in 1999. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We could make a subjective assessment, aimed at our political advantage, or we could try to make a balanced assessment which, by taking account of all the positives and negatives, would allow us to examine the results of the Madrid Summit in light of the positions of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to highlight the fact that the European Parliament was not present at the Río de Janeiro Summit and that, for this very reason, the Inter-Parliamentary Conference requested that it be present at the Madrid Summit, and that is what has happened. I would therefore like to acknowledge the efforts of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to receive the representatives of our Parliament at the Madrid Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, last November, the European Parliament requested that the association agreement with Chile be concluded at the Madrid Summit and that has been done. Last November, the European Parliament asked that impetus be given to the association agreement with Mercosur despite the difficulties being experienced by Argentina and that was done at the Madrid Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in November, Parliament requested the presentation of negotiation guidelines with a view to concluding association agreements with the Andean Community and the Central American Community. The Madrid Summit has not been able to respond definitively to this wish of Parliament’s, but there has been substantial progress in the sense that conclusions include a prospect for association in terms of relations with the countries of the Andean Community and the Central American Community, since they cannot be discriminated against in comparison with other geographical areas, and therefore when the system of generalised preferences expires in 2004 they can aspire to this future association.</p>
<p class="contents">In November we also congratulated the European Commission on the ALIS programme, which was adopted at the Madrid Summit, together with other initiatives such as those referred to by the Presidency-in-Office and Mr Vitorino, and we should all be pleased about this.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe the Madrid Summit’s conclusions in relation to the International Criminal Court and the fight against terrorism and organised crime to be particularly noteworthy and, in this respect, I would like to remind the House that I have just returned from an electoral mission with other members of this Parliament to Colombia, where there is no question that the citizens of that country have offered a wonderful example of democratic maturity and civic courage, ensuring that the peaceful will of the citizens has prevailed over threats, violence, extortion, intimidation and blackmail.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Colombia needs the support of the international community and also the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to make two comments which do not relate to the Madrid Summit, but which I believe are particularly relevant in this context. I always say that Latin America does not need charity but rather opportunities, but it seems to me a bad political signal, and I have said this to Mr Patten, that in this symbolic year of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union and Latin America, the Commission has presented a preliminary draft budget for 2003 containing fewer resources than in 2002. Commissioner, we cannot deal with new priorities with fewer resources. We hope that during the budgetary debate this Parliament will be able to re-establish the kind of sums that Latin America deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr President, we believe that the European Union needs to develop a common strategy for the region which, in full accordance with the bilateral or regional agreements in force or under negotiation, can offer a complete geographical perspective to relations with that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, despite the suspicion and the constant doubt as to whether these summits can achieve concrete results, I believe that the Madrid Summit has achieved complete, tangible and thorough results and that it represents a very reasonable balance between what is desirable and what is possible, between pragmatism and idealism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, in order to make a balanced assessment, we must understand that in the time that has passed between Río and Madrid not all the hopes raised at the Río Summit have been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Developments, in particular economic developments, have lessened expectations and I therefore believe that all the participants and observers at the summit can be moderately satisfied with the fact that the summit has taken place within a context of general agreements, of common denominators, and by the fact that we have been able to present an assessment of relations between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries which contains concrete achievements, association agreements with Mexico and with Chile, the maintenance of the prospect and the will for an association agreement with Mercosur and also the maintenance of a positive outlook in relation to the partnership with the Andean countries and the countries of Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">I warned the Council and the Commission during the debate prior to the Madrid meeting of the foreseeable risk that these countries might be disappointed. I am pleased to acknowledge today that this risk has been successfully prevented, the opening up of a prospect for agreements with the two sub-regions has been maintained, and I hope that this is not a rush forward but a genuinely serious and consistent commitment, because nothing could be worse in this disturbed context than raising expectations and perspectives which are not then met.</p>
<p class="contents">Summits are only worth so much. The important thing is to maintain political momentum and, as Mr Salafranca said a few moments ago, to maintain commitments which must not only be political commitments but practical commitments which are reflected in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is the case, things will move forward. If not, that person who said at the Madrid Summit that ‘we go from summit to summit while our peoples go from abyss to abyss’ will unfortunately be proved right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the effort to improve relations between the EU and Latin America. It is incredibly important to develop cooperation further. We have much in common, not only from an historical perspective but also with a view to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Fox said in this Chamber not so long ago, many Latin American countries see the EU as a role model where human rights are concerned. The attitude to international conventions such as the Kyoto Protocol and to the International War Crimes Tribunal is considerably more constructive in Latin America than in North America. This is an important alliance to build on.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against organised crime and drugs also requires us to work together to a greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Much remains to be done in the area of trade. The EU must open its markets to Latin America, especially when it comes to agriculture. We are always quick to criticise others for protectionism, often with good reason, but what is our food market if not protectionist?</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals would also like to highlight the issue of Cuba and regret that there was no room for it in Parliament’s joint resolution. We are pleased that a resolution on Cuba was adopted in Geneva. A significantly stronger commitment is required in this area than is currently the case. We agree that the US embargo must be lifted. We need to do more to strengthen the democrats in Cuba, however. At the moment, the opposition is more coordinated and more willing to enter into discussion than ever before. The referendum project, the Varela project, is worthy of all our support. The free libraries play an important role in providing Cubans with literature other than the collected speeches of Fidel Castro. Cuba is still a dictatorship, but there are democratic forces there which are strong and organised and which desperately need support from the EU and from Latin America. We must not let them down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have already said on many occasions that, for Europe genuinely to be able to play an important role in Latin America, it must say something different from the United States. However, here too, the only clear deadline set at Madrid was the implementation of the Doha agenda and the negotiation of new free trade agreements. Therefore, free trade is the only prospect we can give Latin America. However, as we all know, this too is very often pure rhetoric. The European Union is not able to provide access to the markets that Latin America would like it to. In any case, even if we achieve a project with the FTAA which we might call the FTAEU, we really do not feel that it will be possible to avoid very large demonstrations such as those which took place in Madrid. One hundred thousand people came to Madrid to demonstrate during the summit – we really cannot say that is insignificant!</p>
<p class="contents">I would briefly mention some other issues. With regard to Argentina, for example, the declaration reads: ‘We welcome and support the present efforts of the Argentinean authorities to complete a sound and comprehensive economic programme, which shall enable successful negotiations with the International Monetary Fund …’ Now, no one can deny that the International Monetary Fund has been one of the main causes of the crisis in Argentina. What do you think the Argentinians protesting in the streets will say when they read those words? They will feel deceived and think that the Europeans are cynics as well as the Americans. Nothing was said about Venezuela and this is clearly a problem. Mrs Malmström has already mentioned Cuba. In other words, we feel that the summit declaration is a list of missing items and missed opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am becoming increasingly convinced, however, that the real problem is the type of vehicle we are using – the summits – and that we will not achieve much through these megasummits. In my opinion, we should rather take up the proposal made by the Commission for a genuine foreign policy and equip ourselves with the tools and resources to give Latin America an alternative to the United States too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We very much regret this. We had indeed hoped the major problems would be dealt with appropriately and appropriate solutions found.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like to list briefly some areas where success seems to have been achieved. Ratification of the agreement with Chile is one of these. Confirmation that things are going well as far as the agreement with Mexico is concerned is another. I should also mention the Commission’s excellent work on the ALBAN proposal for postgraduates previously mentioned, and of course the standard declaration on the benefits of the association strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also, however, a long list of omissions and missed opportunities. I should like to remind you of Mr Salafranca’s own report supported by the whole House. It provided an opportunity to adopt the broadest of approaches to the strategic association between Latin America and Europe, and to take determined action. Unfortunately, this did not come about.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a whole raft of very worrying issues, for instance the fact that all the critical points in Latin America seem to fall within what could loosely be described as the dark shadow cast by the United States in the aftermath of 11 September. Certain aspects of the FTAA (Free Trade Area of America) process are also giving cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Argentina, it should be pointed out that taken together, the European Union countries constitute a majority in the International Monetary Fund. It was within their power to generate quite a different response to the crisis in Argentina.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above all this there is the very worrying situation in Guatemala and in other Central American countries. Freedoms are under attack again. Once again too, leaders and human rights defenders are being done away with. The European Union has failed to rise to the challenge presented by Venezuela, and it has also missed the opportunity of improving relations with Cuba. Finally, I should like to emphasise that the situation in Colombia calls for peace and negotiation, not for lists. In a sense, the latter are the exact opposite to what is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have in mind in particular the protection of fundamental rights, economic cooperation, and the fight against terrorism and drugs. Even if this summit had not achieved any other results, these would be enough to demonstrate that cooperation between the two sides of the Atlantic is a politically credible process, as Commissioner Vitorino has said, which will proceed at a good pace despite the difficulties being experienced by some Latin American countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I wish to strike a note of realism. As with all summits, the objectives set and the means of achieving them are two quite different things. In this context, I believe that it is crucial to adopt initiatives and concrete actions that will give the objectives agreed upon some real substance. It is also essential to increase trade and to stimulate investment in both regions by means of a prudent but decisive policy of opening up markets and by resisting the unjustified temptation to resort to protectionism, as President Prodi has also said. All this presupposes support for private initiatives in the countries of Latin America as a vital element of this twofold strategy of economic development and combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should not lose sight of the need to defend and strengthen human rights and to promote democracy in all the countries of the region, without exception, and those words 'without exception' need to be stressed so that we do not overlook the dictatorship in Cuba once again, except for my colleague Mrs Malmström that is.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the gaps in it, I support the joint motion for a resolution, which is also supported by my own political group, and I am certain that the European Parliament will continue to contribute in the months and years to come, and will continue to devote its attention to this, to developing appropriate conditions for a successful summit to be held in Mexico in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There has been progress, and positive signals have certainly been sent out. Specific agreements such as the association agreement with Chile have been finalised. The latter will result in the most ambitious and innovative free trade area to date, in line with the preferential agreement signed with Mexico two years ago. Our friends in Mercosur, the Andean Pact, the San José Group and the Caribbean should view the agreement with Chile as a further incentive for subregional integration. It is now up to them to make further progress in this respect, through specific actions, not mere words.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Mercosur and the crisis in Argentina are one example of this, but there are others. Latin American democracies are now more soundly based than they were two decades ago. Nonetheless, their institutional weaknesses must be made good if we are to prevent social imbalance and poverty from afflicting an increasing number of sectors of those societies and destabilising and threatening the democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought not and must not rest on our laurels. We should instead forge ahead bravely as regards cooperation with specific countries and projects. Only a few hours ago, the people of Colombia demonstrated their determination and courage as citizens. They came out in favour of peace and coexistence. Sadly, however, terrorists continue to kill, kidnap and blackmail the people of that country and of Peru and Venezuela, whilst we continue to debate whether or not to include those who murder, kidnap or blackmail on the list of terrorist organisations. We are setting a disgraceful example of the use of double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out to the Commission’s representative that the management of our development aid is not up to standard. Funding for projects we have committed to arrives late and sometimes badly. Well-founded complaints are received daily, together with examples that do nothing to enhance the Union’s reputation. Still more unfortunately, development aid is being withheld from large sectors of the population that simply cannot afford to be deprived of its benefits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a great deal of interest in Latin America. Perhaps we are behaving like a semi-conductor. Sometimes, the more empty positions, the higher the standard. Maybe that also applies to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to join with Mr Fernández Martín in asking the Commission to speed up the implementation of projects. When we parliamentarians visit Latin America, the response to our proposals is always, yes, you make excellent proposals, you decide to give us money, but the money never comes. The credibility of the European Union does not depend on a to-do list, but on whether or not we keep our promises. So my request – and I assume I speak here for the whole House – is that the projects be implemented. That the money we budget be disbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and this comment is addressed to the Latin Americans with us now, the more Latin America joins forces, the more Mercosur and the Andes countries and the whole of Latin America joins forces, the more clout they will have in negotiations with the European Union and other countries. Take a leaf – and this really is meant as well-intentioned advice – out of the European Union's book in this case. The problem for us in negotiations with Mercosur and other regions is that we have to listen to several, rather than one voice. And, whether we like it or not, it slows down the negotiating process. I personally am not involved in negotiations, but several people have told me as much. It would be better if you were to speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say how delighted I was with the Mercosur-Europe Business Forum which was held in parallel in Madrid. This is the third time this forum of companies, associations and politicians from Mercosur and Europe has been staged. We need economic and technical dialogue between Europe and Latin America similar to our dialogue with the United States. Perhaps the Commission could make a contribution here too.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment is that there are numerous problems, but there are also opportunities waiting to be exploited. In Parliament, we are currently processing several directives which will offer trading opportunities: a directive on biofuels – where we can offer them new markets – and a directive on CO2 emissions trading in the wake of the Kyoto agreement. This too offers new opportunities for collaboration, to Latin America's advantage. All this deserves to be discussed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see it as a particularly good thing that, at the start of the joint resolutions, we are emphasising the values which Europe and Latin America share, as it is important that we see this partnership not only in an economic light, but that we can also speak of our common values and their consequences in political terms. I believe that certain elements which the Greens have tried to introduce are also positive – for example, that we should have more to say about sustainability. Overall, though, the Greens' resolution, and that of the UEN, are too negative, with their opposition to the USA, to globalisation, and to free trade, which I do not think gets us very far. We need here a balanced relationship between constructive cooperation and justified criticism of details.</p>
<p class="contents">I expressly support what Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra had to say about the Budget. Nothing is achieved by much talking and putting on great summits and at the same time allocating less money. That is what the Commission has proposed over and over again in the last few years. Over and over again, we have prevented it, but the Commission really should, for once, come up with constructive proposals at the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Malmström and Mr Queiró had a certain amount to say about Cuba. I believe it to be of the utmost importance that we should avoid sending the wrong signals to Cuba at the present time when people there are calling loud and clear for democracy. We are of course opposed to the embargo, but we also oppose dictatorship and the violation of human rights. That is why dialogue with the European Union can gain Cuba concessions only if the situation there as regards democracy and human rights improves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with the suggestion that, in opening up markets, we should focus above all on the poorer countries of Latin America. I believe we can agree on mutual free trade with both Mexico and Chile, but perhaps not with the same timetable, but with countries such as Nicaragua, Honduras and Bolivia, we should also prioritise unilateral preferences, and I believe that these countries have the same right to preferential treatment as most of the ACP states. I think the dialogue should give more attention to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenzel (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency's desire to make a particular mark and send a signal of solidarity and political rapprochement by holding the Latin American and Caribbean Summit in Madrid is something to be welcomed. It ties in with Spain's unique involvement in Latin America, which results not only from its history but also from major economic interests. When Latin America sneezes, Spain catches a cold, or so I read recently. There is of course a good deal more underlying this summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Linking the two continents is, as President Prodi has put it, a matter of European concern. There is of course far too little public attention paid in Europe to the political upheavals and economic crises in the region. Very often, we are surprised when a country as rich in crude oil as Venezuela slides into a crisis which is grave not only for that country's economy but also for its democracy. We seem to have grown accustomed to Argentina collapsing, and the international capital markets go more in fear of Japan's possible economic downfall than of Argentina's economy going bust.</p>
<p class="contents">Again and again, though, we put our hopes in a new beginning for democracy, as we have done now in the aftermath of the elections in Columbia, a country which is a prime example of how closely combined are drug crime and international terrorism. It is for our Parliament in particular to demand energetically that the Colombian politician Ingrid Betancour be released from the hands of left-wing guerrillas.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, the EU has to give life to Latin America's strategy, which, as Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra said, means making available the financial resources to do it. In real terms, that also means the establishment of a free trade area comprising the EU and the central American and Andean States, which should eventually lead to an association agreement comparable to those with Mexico and Chile. Negotiations on an agreement of this sort with the Mercosur countries have unfortunately taken their place.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should not just leave the Latin American market to the USA. Any Latin American strategy is about much more than economic interests, and we need it also to combat organised crime and illegal immigration. The final measure of what will have been achieved will be the EU-Latin America in Mexico in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cortés,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has enjoyed the support of this House and coordination with the Commission throughout the preparation for the second EU/Latin American and Caribbean Summit, and throughout the summit itself. Parliament was properly represented at the summit sessions and during the preparatory work. Its constant support has proved most useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe everything we have heard in this debate confirms my impression and this process. True, shortcomings have been identified, and we could all have hoped to achieve more, make faster progress, and for the outcome to be more meaningful. It is always possible to expect more from a process. I do however honestly believe that any assessment of the summit has to acknowledge that its results have been satisfactory. This is substantiated by media reports in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and also through direct contacts with political leaders in Latin American countries. In particular, the summit is deemed to have developed political, economic and cultural dialogue between two parts of the world called upon to establish closer links and understand each other better.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the European Parliament has been at the forefront of these negotiations and has served as a touchstone. A number of speakers have already made this clear. It is from your viewpoint as trailblazers that some of you have pointed critically to areas in which you feel frustrated, because we have not made as much progress or achieved as much as we could have hoped and could probably have attained. Our experience within the European Union has however taught us that processes of this nature, such as the one we are ourselves engaged in on our continent, do take time. They involve very many procedures. Progress can be fast, but there are occasions when setbacks are experienced. I have to say quite frankly though, that if we review the relationship between Latin America and the European Union in recent years, taking into account that the Madrid Summit was only the second of its kind, we can appreciate that this is a relatively new process. A date has already been set, however, for the third summit, in Mexico, which will take place in two years’ time. Consequently the interval between summits is now shorter, and we can assume the relationship has become established. I agree that a great many meetings and significant public ceremonies are crammed into the day or day and a half a summit lasts. It is however important not to overlook the preparatory work which begins long before a summit. In this case, the work was triggered by Parliament and pursued determinedly by the Commission. The Swedish and Belgian Presidencies were very involved with the groundwork for matters that would be dealt with during the Spanish Presidency. I honestly believe that the result is positive and that we can congratulate ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca mentioned Colombia, and rightly so. I believe it is very important to keep Colombia in mind. This country has endured more than its fair share of crime and violence, but has now elected a new government democratically. The incoming government deserves the same trust and support from the international community, and in particular from the European Union, which has long been involved in peace and development in Columbia, as it has had from the Colombian people.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as a Spaniard, I endorse what several honourable Members said, namely that it is good to have non-Spaniards involved with Latin America. In this connection, I very much welcome the Commission’s ALBAN programme. It promises to be of great benefit as it opens up all European universities to postgraduate students. In the past, such students were channelled to the United States, or sometimes to Spain, because a strong bilateral programme was in place. I believe it is very important for postgraduate students across Latin America and the Caribbean to be able to choose what they consider to be the most reputable and appropriate university or higher education institution in which to pursue their studies. In this way, the relationship between our regions will be strengthened still further. The relationship is not merely a political one, centred on the Madrid Summit. After all, a summit only involves Heads of State and of Government. It should be borne in mind that before, during, and even after the summit, a great many meetings involving what could broadly be termed civil society took place. Relationships were created and reliable channels of information established to allow information to flow freely between the Commission, the Presidency of the Council and authorities in the Latin American countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right today to commend all the work underpinning what was approved at the summit. It was excellent work involving many individuals. As is usual at such Councils, issues were approved in a few hours. One should however remember that they were previously the subject of lengthy discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, it is my view that the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean have strengthened their political, economic, cultural, educational and social links. The European Union is currently engaged in a process of internal consolidation. Nonetheless, it, as a world player, is called upon to be actively involved in a part of the world with which it shares so many principles and values.</p>
<p class="contents">What took place after 1492 was the grafting of a European element on to a pre-existing reality. This resulted in what we term the Western world. The centre of gravity shifted westwards. We share principles and values we had developed here. Nowadays they are enshrined in expressions such as democracy, the rule of law, gender equality and respect for human rights. The situation is precarious in some cases, and continual monitoring and support are needed. Nonetheless, the European Union is a lodestar for Latin America and for the Caribbean. It serves as a social model, an economic model, a political model, and also as a model of integration. We could point to the successful integration of the European Union, located on a far more heterogeneous and diverse continent, and faced with the challenge of so many European languages. Our challenge was far greater than that facing Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite all this, European Union integration has been a resounding success. It can be an example for the people of Latin America and the Caribbean and I think it is incumbent on us to help them rise to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">A strengthened relationship will be in our mutual interest. We have no wish to act against any other party. Instead, as Mr Linkohr stated, we hope to exploit opportunities in areas where we are currently facing difficulties and uncertainties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Presidency-in-Office is pleased with the debate generated. In addition, the Presidency is grateful for Parliament’s unfailing encouragement and would like to acknowledge publicly the support and inspiration this House has always offered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
