<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Kovács,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first let me express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, for his objective analysis of the Commission's proposal. I am pleased to note that his report corresponds fully with the views of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about the Commission's proposal. In the communication on the VAT strategy presented in 2003, the simplification of tax obligations was identified as one of the key areas for future work. In particular, a proposal for a directive on this issue was scheduled for 2004. The objective of simplifying business obligations in the field of VAT is in line with the request made by the European Council of 25 and 26 March 2004 to identify areas for simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Becsey rightly says in his report, cross-border businesses need to comply with the tax rules of every Member State in which they undertake their activities. That implies that such businesses are faced with enormous administrative burdens, which discourage companies – especially small and medium-sized enterprises – from cross-border business. Those burdens obstruct the smooth functioning of the European single market.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the ways of attaining the Lisbon agenda objectives, in particular that of promoting economic growth, is to reduce cross-border administrative burdens and compliance costs in order to facilitate Community-wide activities by businesses. The Commission's proposal fully meets the objective of reducing such administrative burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes the establishment of an optional one-stop system, whereby taxable persons can fulfil their VAT obligations in the Member State of establishment. It will harmonise the scope of the goods and services to which Member States may apply restrictions on the right to deduct. It will extend the use of obligatory reverse-charge mechanisms for certain business-to-business transactions carried out by non-established taxable persons. Furthermore, it reviews and updates the scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises and simplifies the distance-selling arrangements. Finally, it will provide for the exchange of information between Member States, which will be facilitated by the electronic system for the exchange of information.</p>
<p class="contents">For your information, the proposal has received a positive reaction from the European Economic and Social Committee. The Committee has acknowledged that, in the current environment, the unanimity rule for decision-making applies; the Commission should opt for a pragmatic approach. The United Kingdom Presidency has indicated that it will give these proposals a high priority, and discussion on this proposal commenced in the Council during July. Two more meetings will be devoted to the subject in September. So far, the Council has concentrated its discussions on a general overview of the Commission's proposal. I appreciate that the Council's approach has been globally positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zsolt László Becsey (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(HU) </span>I am in a fortunate position at the time of the proposal for a one-stop shop scheme for value-added tax returns. This package of proposals could certainly be a major step towards building a unified internal market. With the introduction of this scheme – which I hope will be possible in early 2007 – small traders for whom it has not been worthwhile employing or contracting a tax advisor to deal with their value-added tax affairs in other Member States, will be able to file their VAT returns without a tax advisor. This will allow them to obtain refunds that they have not been able to claim up to now. The lack of such refunds has been damaging their competitiveness and they have suffered a disadvantage compared to larger enterprises. We know that more than half of the outstanding VAT owed to businesses is not being refunded at present (according to a survey by the Commission).</p>
<p class="contents">A positive aspect of the proposal is that everyone will be able to deal with these matters in their own language and with the help of their home authorities, and will be able to receive the VAT owed to them or make VAT payments directly. As the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs seeks to translate into practice its proposed amendments, electronic administration will speed up registration and the recording of any modification to the data. Another advantage for businesses is that the deadline for refunding value-added tax can been shortened.</p>
<p class="contents">The scheme does not change current practice whereby value-added tax is payable in the country of consumption; in other words it is neutral with regard to different tax rates. I agree with the Commission’s approach with regard to launching the introduction of the simplified scheme. In other words, it does not want to open up debate as regards the fundamental issue of whether VAT should be paid according to the place of origin of the supplier or goods, or according to the place of consumption, as is current practice. I hope that in the Council the Member States too will be principled enough to forgo tying this positive initiative to such a fundamental philosophical debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The other advantage of the proposal is that it opens up a path for progress on a number of issues on the basis of common principles, and this progress will evolve precisely as a result of the one-stop system. A case in point is the first common list of exclusions from VAT deduction. This would make any items that are excluded in all Member States – primarily luxury consumption items – subject to common regulations. It thereby avoids tying the hands of businesses, but does not seek to link the right to deduct VAT in future to the place of establishment – rather than to the place of consumption – thereby also facilitating information-gathering and planning for small businesses and eliminating unnecessary competitive situations. Another case I would also include here, however, is the possibility it creates to enable easier inspection of an enterprise’s turnover in the case of distance selling, in other words simplifying distance selling arrangements up to a reasonable threshold set for the whole of the European Union rather than for each Member State. Up to a threshold of EUR 150 000, businesses would be able to choose whether to pay VAT on the revenue from distance selling in the country of consumption or the country of establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">The electronic system – use of which will incidentally be optional for the Member State and the business concerned – will also help us to set a uniform maximum VAT-exemption threshold for small businesses. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also adopted my suggestion to set a minimum VAT-exemption threshold to be applied for the first three years of activity of a newly established business. By doing so we are providing a sound incentive for new businesses and a stimulus for family employment in line with the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has been made on a number of other issues, too. First of all, I accept the caution evinced by the Commission in its decision not to review experience with the regime for trade conducted electronically until after 2006; at the same time, it may also review whether this system could be extended to the current one-stop scheme. It will consider in particular whether to allow businesses also to file VAT returns and make refund applications electronically via the relevant tax office based on the place of establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important advance is the proposal to examine how to build a uniform electronic system permitting cooperation among national tax administrations, eliminating abuses and speeding up inspections. In the interests of legal certainty, the time permitted for the tax administration to ask further questions or request additional information prior to making a refund should be made even shorter, since this would help to enhance businesses’ liquidity.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make the system more business-friendly, I have proposed that the whole of the one-stop scheme and the modifications now being implemented in connection with it should be subject to a thorough review by the Commission four years after its adoption, to analyse experience so far with the scheme and propose any modifications deemed necessary. I think this would also be a reasonable occasion for the Member States to review the application of a value-added tax payment scheme based on place of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues and the experts from the European Commission for their good work and constructive approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy requires an improvement of taxation rules to promote growth and employment. A reduction in administrative burdens can promote the internal market and stimulate business activity, in particular by encouraging the involvement of small and medium-sized businesses and by benefiting consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of simplification, modernisation, uniform application and intensification of the fight against tax fraud. In order to make progress with these objectives, we believe we should learn from experience and take advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies. We therefore warmly welcome the Commission’s proposals on the simplification of cross–border returns and obligations, the harmonisation of the categories of deductible charges and administrative cooperation within the context of the one–stop system.</p>
<p class="contents">The final outcome of the report by Mr Becsey represents a step in that direction, and is worthy of praise, even though it has been spoilt by the inclusion of an amendment, Amendment 9, which alters the Commission’s intention to recognise the power of the Member States to grant exemptions for small and medium–sized businesses whose turnover does not exceed EUR 100 000. We believe that its alternative wording has led to conflict over whether or not it is appropriate or correct, and that has diminished the consensus within the various Groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can recover our unity on this point as soon as possible, so that we can make sound progress towards the European Union’s objectives in the very sensitive area dealt with in the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I deeply regret that all these important issues, the previous presentation and others, including one on paediatrics, are being considered so late at night, because the issues addressed here concern everyone. People are often not aware of these issues, and then we are surprised when they ask what Parliament is doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax administration will have a positive impact on small and medium-sized businesses, since it will facilitate the expansion of activity beyond national borders. This is also very important to enterprises in my country, in particular transport companies, that still fail to reach agreements with other countries concerning the timely refund of the VAT. However, while positively reflecting on the proposals submitted, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to certain other proposals and amendments suggested by Parliament and our group, the Liberal Democrats. First of all, companies should be allowed to prepare their documents in the language of their home country, since it is difficult to imagine that a small company could prepare documents in 21 languages as we do in Parliament. Second, it is necessary to help small and medium-sized enterprises to avoid losses in connection with currency fluctuations, since not all States have all currencies, and moreover, the exchange rate may fluctuate during the period while the VAT is being refunded, thus causing significant losses to small and medium-sized enterprises. In conclusion, I would like to point out that it is very important to ensure that this version of the directive is implemented more efficiently than its previous version, and I ask the Commission to ensure the close monitoring of the implementation of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mr Becsey for his report and all the speakers for their interventions. My thanks also go to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their contribution to our joint work. I am delighted that, on the whole, Parliament supports the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I am unable to support the amendments that have been tabled. This is not due to any fundamental reasons of principle, and certainly not because I question the good intentions underlying the proposed amendments. I am unable to support them simply because in fact they are unjustified and superfluous, since on the one hand they repeat solutions already contained in the proposal, and on the other, they are concerned with pointless details. In the case of some of the proposed amendments, I am unable to accept them because they refer to periods of time or deadlines that are too long in view of the capabilities of the electronic tax declaration system.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to draw attention to Amendment 9, proposing a minimum VAT exemption threshold of EUR 50 000 for small and medium enterprises. This would be an excessive increase, and would distort competition. As regards the assumption underlying Amendment 10, that the directive could have adverse budgetary implications for Member States and businesses, it is the Commission’s opinion that this danger does not exist, since the proposal does not change the regulations on taxation, it merely simplifies them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise particularly the importance of ensuring the rapid entry into force of this proposal: as Mr Becsey stated in his report and other speakers, too, have pointed out, this directive would greatly simplify the activities of cross-border businesses, enhance competitiveness, and help to boost growth and create jobs. In other words, it will help to achieve the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the plenary sitting of the European Parliament this week will adopt the Commission’s proposal. I am also hopeful that the decision of the European Parliament will have a favourable influence on the Council’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taxes that stay the same help businesses to plan for the future with confidence. Yet we have had a continuous stream of directives and regulations on VAT. While the current proposals purport to simplify, particularly for small businesses, the main drive has always been rather to harmonise - to prevent so-called 'harmful tax competition', to achieve a uniform minimum rate for VAT, ending derogations such as the zero-rated items we have in the UK. Ten new member states give harmonisation additional impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we need harmonised VAT rates? To help the single market? But we shall never achieve a single VAT rate and since there seems to be little effort to harmonise the much greater differences in rates of excise duty, one has to look for other motives. I suspect that the ultimate objective sought by the Commission is to have VAT centrally administered and collected, guaranteeing a continuing source of funds for the EU budget not subject to bickering between EU member states. We should be aware of this possibility and not allow it to occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
