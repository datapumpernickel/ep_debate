The latter are an essential part of any action plan, and I hope that Mr Dimas agrees that the central focus of this Action Plan ought to have been the protection of children. Yet if we ask ourselves what Mr Dimas has turned the Commission’s SCALE programme into, the answer must be that SCALE is now short for ‘stopping caring about legislating for the environment’, and this, Mr Dimas, is the major criticism that must be levelled at your proposal. It is true that you inherited it from the previous Commission, but an action plan cannot consist merely of research, research and more research, with not a single genuine measure to reduce environmental pollution and impact on health, in particular children’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">An action plan should also not be something that uses a lack of scientific consensus to put off action indefinitely, as that would be to turn the precautionary principle completely on its head. What we expect from you, Mr Dimas, is action, and I am delighted that this House has sent a clear signal in this respect today; we cannot lend our approval to your Action Plan, which in reality is nothing but a plan of non-action. After all, we agree that the protection of children must be an absolute priority for the European Union; I therefore find it incomprehensible that you can dare to submit a plan of non-action of this kind to this House, and not only that, but that you can dare to call it an action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this not only insults the intelligence of Members of this House; it flies in the face of our expectations and indeed of the Commission’s previous proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Schnellhardt and the Group of the European People’s Party that I take a dim view of those who bow to pressure from the tobacco lobby and say that passive smoking does not cause cancer, as this is very far from being the truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mrs Ries on her report. The recognition that health is interconnected with our physical and social environment must become a consistent aspect of mainstream policy and debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ries is correct in her criticism of the significant gap that exists between the Commission's initial health and environment strategy and this action plan. The gap can be seen in the small number of concrete actions proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to look at the success stories in Ireland and elsewhere in relation to the smoking ban in workplaces. There has been an 18% drop in cigarette consumption in Ireland and many who opposed a complete ban on tobacco smoke in workplaces now accept it as normal.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to move beyond the notion that health is simply a lifestyle choice and the action plan fails to do this. For the most disadvantaged in our society to be empowered to break free from ill health and poverty, we need defined and concerted action by Member States and the Commission. Such action must also be adequately resourced.</p>
<p class="contents">More action is needed in working with health professionals and NGOs to empower communities to play an active part in building a better environment; we need more action on the protection of children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups, from hazardous environments and products; we need more action on removing hazardous chemicals from the market; and we need adequate labelling on the environmental and health implications of products and materials. It is also vital that we have recourse to the precautionary principle because of the possible serious risks to health if we fail to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly agree with Mrs Ries and her assertion that in order to ensure the coherence and effectiveness of the action plan, it is necessary to establish adequate funding now for the 2004-2007 period. I would like to thank her for her work and commend her report to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the warnings issued by many experts have been ignored for years is not only a result of ignorance and thoughtlessness, but also of the activities of wealthy and influential interest groups that profit from other people’s misfortune. Risk analyses have already demonstrated that a clear risk exists, so research similar to the National Children’s Study is not what is needed in many Member States. That would amount to no more than another risk analysis. What are actually needed are immediate corrective measures that both reduce and, ideally, eliminate sources of harmful emissions, as such measures would genuinely make it possible to protect people’s health and save their lives. An effective monitoring system is also required, comprising regional screening panels and local prevention programmes. The Action Plan should focus more on protection of the environment, including the local environment, and on the setting up of a European Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Like its American prototype, this Agency’s remit would be to offer a service to citizens of EU Member States by making use of scientific advances, providing reliable information and reacting to public health threats. In my opinion, the European Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry should come under the umbrella of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and work together with the European Environment Agency.

This creates a system where there is free movement of people from one Member State to the next. It therefore makes a lot of political sense for the European Union to take a lead coordinating role to promote better health within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is in a very strong position to see exactly which Member States are exercising the best techniques to tackle diseases, such as acute respiratory infections, which is the main cause of death for children under the age of five. The EU must learn from the best practice techniques available within the European Union to tackle health disorders, such as asthma, childhood allergies and neuro-development disorders.</p>
<p class="contents">We should recall that it was the European Union that took the initiative recently to ban the use of particular chemicals in the manufacture of plastic tiles.</p>
<p class="contents">On a separate matter, the European Commission has already stated that the reduction in the use of tobacco products will be a key political objective of this European Commission. Great strides have already been taken from an Irish perspective and this is a model which could be used in other Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line is this: if we are to improve the public health of the people of Europe, we must ensure that adequate budgets are put aside to deal with such problems. That is why I fully support the recommendation in this report that at least EUR 300 million be put aside under the 7th Research Framework Programme (2007-2012) to promote a higher standard of health within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament has extensive powers of codecision to deal with environmental and public health issues. I can assure the Commission and the Council presidency that we will use these powers rigorously in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be all too easy to paint a black-and-white picture of nightmare scenarios, but we should not forget that we have succeeded in making enormous progress in various fields relating to environmental quality. One need only think of the Auto Oil I and II programmes which we used to improve the quality of petrol, in so doing combating the problem of acid rain, or the European legislation that has been used to achieve certain levels of air and water quality.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, however, I do not believe that we can rest on our laurels. The figures are alarming; one in six deaths or diseases suffered by children in Europe is attributable to environmental factors, the incidence of allergic respiratory diseases having doubled over the past 20 years, with every seventh child now affected, and nearly 10% of workers being exposed to carcinogenic substances.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the Action Plan that is currently before us is urgently needed. We must ensure that the precautionary principle gains acceptance, not least for budgetary reasons. Public health should be regarded as our top priority in any case, but it is also true that poor public health is an excessive burden on our state budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The form taken by the Action Plan therefore needs to be improved in the following respects. Although the Commission was right in its decision to prioritise the need to combat four environmentally-related diseases, the approach it has taken leaves much to be desired. No consideration has been given to a large number of recently published studies, and there are no provisions relating to the application of legal instruments, in contrast to the SCALE initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a lack of measures aimed at informing the public about the causal connection between environmental pollution and health, and no provision has been made for a long-term evaluation that would make it possible to examine whether the measures are helping to reduce environmentally-related health problems in a cost-effective manner. Priority should therefore be given to research into the production and use of everyday products that contain allergenic or carcinogenic chemicals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A third of work-related illnesses are due to the use of chemicals dangerous to people’s health. As we write in this report, damage to the nervous system caused by mercury, pesticides and other chemicals has increased markedly in recent decades.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on discovering and phasing out dangerous chemicals is, then, a decisive factor in improving people’s health. This fact, although emphasised in this report, must also form the basis for this House’s forthcoming discussions concerning the future chemicals policy, REACH.</p>
<p class="contents">Diseases and ill-health affect different groups in society in different ways. Children are very sensitive to environmental influences. People on low incomes are affected more often by disease than people on high incomes, and there is a difference between ill health in men and ill health in women. The committee has borne these factors in mind, and it has been very important to us Social Democrats to have them included. We have had the report include both the fact that there needs to be more focus upon particularly vulnerable groups and the fact that data must be collected in such a way that more information can be obtained about the ways in which different groups in society are vulnerable and are affected by various forms of environmental pollution. For example, we want to see statistics broken down according to gender so that we can discover and combat differences between men and women where health and disease are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only our environment that causes illness. Lifestyle-related illness also constitutes a great threat today. We Social Democrats have therefore chosen to emphasise the need for increased efforts to combat disease caused, especially, by alcohol but also by tobacco, poor diet and lack of exercise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Human health, both physical and mental, is directly related to the environment we live in. Most disease processes are the result of interactions between our bodies and various environmental factors. This is common sense. An environment and health action plan should have two main goals: firstly, to identify quickly the main environmental health risk factors and, secondly, to eliminate or minimise their effect on human health as soon as possible. This is also common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan proposed by the Commission is, unfortunately, more planning and less action. It is principally concerned with improving information and research relating to environmental pollutants and disease causation, and enhancing environment health communication procedures between Member States. It eventually aims to help improve human health. Is this common sense? On one hand yes, because information, research and cooperation in environment-health interaction matters are always a good thing, <span class="italic">but</span>, we do not necessarily need more time- and money-consuming, research-related mechanisms in order to act fast and save lives now.</p>
<p class="contents">We already know which main environment hazards kill people, so it would be common sense to concentrate first on these and try to eliminate them quickly and efficiently. An obvious example is smoking. We know that both active and passive smoking kills hundreds of thousands of people in Europe every year. We also know that the only effective way to reduce the deadly habit of smoking is to drastically increase the price of cigarettes, to ban cigarette advertising completely and to stop our farmers from producing tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this what we are doing? Not quite! A packet of cigarettes is still relatively cheap in many EU Member States; cigarette advertising, in particular indirect advertising, which is more effective because it acts subconsciously, is still happening and we are still subsidising many of our farmers to grow tobacco. This is definitely not common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I say 'yes' to research and information for combating long-term environment-related diseases we do not know much about, but I urge the Commission to say 'yes' to immediate drastic action to prevent the diseases we already are very familiar with today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has now been adequately proven that fertility is decreasing and the number of miscarriages is rising as a result of environmental influences. It is becoming increasingly clear that people suffer from allergies. The number of children suffering from asthma and having to go through life with inhalers is on the up. The influence of tobacco smoke on the health of non-smokers has become abundantly clear to us all. The action plan thus fits into the scale approach which focuses on five key concepts: science, children, awareness, legal instruments and evaluation. I have to say, though, Commissioner, that when the action programme was presented, there was a great deal of disappointment and scepticism. Allow me to mention three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the significant gap between the ambitions in the general strategy and the action plan itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the action plan is not really an action plan, but rather a research plan, and one that will probably fail to actually reduce the disease burden that is caused by environmental pollution. As various Members have told the House, Commissioner, we do not need more research or studies; what we really do need, though, is action.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are no concrete financial proposals from the Commission as to how all this is to be funded. Without funding, you cannot get the show on the road; that, Commissioner, is impossible and not feasible, that much we know. This leads to much scepticism, much concern, although fortunately there is satisfaction about Mrs Ries’ report and the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I should like to focus on two more points that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to introduce by way of two amendments; we would like to emphasise that no targets have been proposed for the proposed actions, and that, out of the 13 actions, only three pertain to specific measures to reduce the disease burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would like to emphasise that there is no system of biomonitoring in place with a link to environmental medicine. I urge you, Commissioner, to take Parliament’s remarks into consideration and would be grateful if you turned your action plan into a real action plan that does credit to its name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something that we oncologists know about and, unfortunately, frequently come up against.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental pollution plays a huge part in the development of cancer, a disease which will attack one in three Europeans during their lifetime. Allow me to give you a prediction, Commissioner: at the rate at which cardiology, both interventional and surgical, is progressing today, do not be surprised if, in a few years' time, cancer becomes the primary cause of death in the Member States of the European Union. However, the prevention of cancer and other diseases is necessary and clearly more economical than their further treatment. I would like to emphasise here that smoking, against which Commissioner Kyprianou is campaigning, is the basic but not the only environmental factor which plays a huge part in the development of cancer. Unfortunately, the Commission confines itself in the REACH plan to pronouncements alone, while it delays the definition of legislative measures and special headings for their application with the excuse that more research is needed. As Mrs Ries also said, the plan is an evaluation plan rather than an action plan. There are numerous valid scientific studies on substances which are harmful to the environment and human health, which makes us wonder what interests the Commission is protecting: the interests of the European citizen or of the big industries? There is an urgent need for certain specific dangerous substances referred to in the report to be withdrawn from the European market, especially as safer alternatives are available. In this case, among other things, the supposed lack of information should not be put forward as an excuse for the lack of action. Similarly, it is absolutely necessary for resources to be found both for research, which naturally needs to be intensified, and for the prevention of diseases with an environmental cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowhere does the plan propose taking recourse to the precautionary principle. Nor does it stipulate where the money will come from. In addition, resources are needed for informing the public and professionals, with a view to cleaning up workplaces and indoor and outdoor spaces frequented by children from active and passive smoking, which the report provides for, as well as from other factors. I should like to emphasise here the vulnerable position of low-income social groups which, because of their economic and social position, are exposed to a disproportionate degree to environmental risks, such as workers in unhealthy professions.</p>
<p class="contents">I close with the hope that both the European Commission and the European Council will take serious account of the report by Mrs Ries, whom I congratulate on her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are well, it is hopefully one of our most valued. In Ireland we have a saying that illustrates the priority we give to health. If someone fails an exam or dents his car bumper or something like that, we put the calamity in perspective by saying 'at least we have our health'. I want to congratulate Mrs Ries: she has not minced her words. The health of people, especially of children, is being put at risk in our countries in Europe and the health action plan in its present form is not equipped truly to protect us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ries has also strongly continued the important process of naming and shaming toxic chemicals and seeking their eradication. I would like to support her in this and, if anything, express the hope that we can soon add to the list more chemicals such as antimony, dioxins, and fluorosilic acid. I would like to mention that the last toxic chemical, fluorosilic acid, which is used to fluoridate water supplies in my country, has the invidious effect of making other toxic substances, such as lead, mercury and aluminium, exponentially more dangerous. It is a chemical usher that leeches these other poisons into the water and then transfers them to body tissue and bone.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that mercury, which is probably the most neurotoxic pollutant of them all, comes under scrutiny in Mrs Ries' report. I would also extend the awareness of the dangers of mercury to include the fact that it is used as a convenient industrial preservative that needs to be replaced. I am also especially concerned that the action plan should be improved to include truly efficient and responsive health monitoring systems. Another saying we have at home is 'at least no one died', but this is no longer true: people are dying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a great deal of wisdom in this proverb, and we must therefore support every effort made to maintain the health of society and the individuals within it. Yet without wishing to disparage the Commission’s efforts, this Action Plan is an investigation – and not only that, but an investigation for which the latest findings could unfortunately not be used – rather than an effective, detailed and far-reaching measure aimed at rectifying a situation that has been recognised as a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike many of the previous speakers, my aim is not to see the glass as half empty; I should like to see it as half full, and to congratulate you on your efforts. At the same time, however, I should like to encourage you to do more and to be more courageous in the conclusions you draw. By way of an illustration of the precautionary principle, I should like to cite the following example. The Italian Government recently banned smoking in virtually all indoor spaces in Italy, and a wave of indignation swept through the country; yet there can be no doubt that the ban has had a positive impact. If the EUR 1 billion spent today on growing tobacco were, gradually and in due course, to be reallocated to health, a courageous step could be taken towards improving it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the European Parliament through the report of Frédérique Ries sets out specific measures for implementing the programme of the common environmental and health policy for the period 2004-2010, we may be aware that these are areas in which the European Union is becoming a world leader. After all this is not just a free trade zone, it is also a political, economic and even social project. The fight against social exclusion is one of its key elements.</p>
<p class="contents">Following enlargement, environmental and health policies have acquired new frameworks. The European Union of 25 members is registering an increase in regional and social differences, something that is directly reflected in people’s quality of health. Counter to expectations, 55 million people are living in poverty. The most vulnerable groups are older people living alone, single mothers and the unemployed. The profiles of these groups, which are at risk as a result of exclusion and therefore also in terms of health, clearly illustrate how societies have developed, how production methods have changed and how economies work.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States are not a homogeneous whole, but certain indicators are similar, since they are the result of similar conditions in the transition period. There is an especially large gulf between the old and new Member States regarding the extent of funds invested in health care. I trust that by means of the common strategy it will gradually be possible to reverse the negative trends we are seeing at present. Like the environment, the health of the population is an interdepartmental issue. Less development means less health. Timely investments in health reduce the costs to the economy as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Forgive me for being sceptical. It is inevitable that new initiatives will be required to move the action plan forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress the importance of identifying gaps in knowledge and ensuring that any initiatives necessary to fill such gaps are well thought out and capable of delivering the required outcomes. These must be based on EU risk evaluation procedures and the opinions of relevant scientific committees, which also allow for peer review. The integrity of the legislation we adopt in this House continually and increasingly depends on scientific rigour, and I have increasing concerns about that.</p>
<p class="contents">All impact assessments must be attributable to their authors. They should not be merely the result of in-house navel gazing. The authors' names must be on every impact assessment, so that we know where they come from and whether we believe vested interests are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Member States there is a need for much-improved coordination between public bodies carrying out activities related to food monitoring, drinking water monitoring, air quality monitoring, and so on. In relation to health impact assessment, it seems to be internationally accepted that the methodology is evolving rather than settled, and that there is considerable difficulty in establishing and collecting the statistical data needed scientifically to underpin health impact assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot protect people from themselves, nor should we legislate for all life's risks. We have to be frank about this. I would like to see a definition of public health. We continue to use that term across a swathe of legislation; it means different things in different countries. The Commission is talking about the health of the European public, not delivering public health services.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like the Commission to ban mass medication of the public water supply. From an ethical point of view, it can no longer be accepted by the EU institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The contribution of the European Parliament is very important. Through the close cooperation between Parliament and the Commission we will be able to provide the European Union with an effective and efficient way of addressing the possible consequences on human health of environmental concerns. I wish to comment briefly on your observations and try to answer your questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The gradual setting-up of an integrated environment and health information system, in which human bio-monitoring will play an essential role, is the added value of the Action Plan. It is a long-term and ambitious plan, but this will not prevent us from taking action. Indeed, many actions have already been taken on the major environment and health issues. Just to give you some examples, I wish to draw your attention to clean water and sanitation, which are dealt with through the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Drinking Water Directive and the Bathing Water Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Respiratory diseases will be tackled even more through CAFE <span class="bold">–</span> the Clean Air for Europe programme. Diseases related to chemical and physical stresses are already addressed through the legislation on pesticides and biocides. The new chemicals policy <span class="bold">–</span> REACH <span class="bold">–</span> will be an essential cornerstone in this area. We need to bear in mind how far we have come and ensure that we build on existing efforts rather than duplicate them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is already a great deal of legislative action forthcoming which will have an impact on the protection of human health. This relates in particular to the thematic strategies of REACH and CAFE. We must continue with our efforts before coming up with additional elements and it is for this reason that the environment and health strategy focuses on preparing the next generation of environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment and health strategy contained a specific focus on children and during the stakeholder consultation process to prepare the Action Plan, experts highlighted that concern. Firstly, that parental exposure should be included to cover the unborn child and, secondly, that we should look at adults in order to cover diseases caused by childhood exposure. For these reasons the Action Plan has widened the focus to include adults as well, taking into consideration the various categories of vulnerability.</p>
<p class="contents">The precautionary principle is at the core of environment policy and it will continue to be the cornerstone of our action. It will be applied according to the conditions set out in the relevant legislation. The Commission fully agrees with this line. I want to be extremely clear to avoid any possible misunderstanding. The Commission will not use this lack of information in the field of environment and health as an excuse for inaction.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the financial plan, we very much welcome Parliament's support in its role as budgetary authority for the funding to implement the Action Plan. We are constrained by the existing budgetary initiatives until 2006 and we will make the best use of all available funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently making the case within the Commission for a very substantial increase in the amount of research funding devoted to environment and health. Parliament's request for funding of EUR 300 million for 2007-2010 provides us with extremely useful political support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Member States must also play a role. A European Union version of the United States' National Children's Study, which the Parliament has requested, would cost about EUR 100 million per year. This amounts to a massive increase of our current environment and health funding. We hope to provide as much support as possible at European Union level, but major commitment must also come from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission greatly values Parliament's cooperation and its constructive efforts in this area. In order to make the most of this the Commission will regularly inform the relevant parliamentary committee on the progress made in implementing the Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to underline that by 2007 we will have made significant progress in establishing the information system and we hope to have the first results of the effectiveness of cost efficiency measures to address health problems. At this point we will report back to Parliament in substantive terms on whether existing policies are working and what new policy initiatives will be required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
