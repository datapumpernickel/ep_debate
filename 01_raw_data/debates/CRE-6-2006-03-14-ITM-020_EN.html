<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Grech (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the report which I have presented for Parliament’s consideration and approval outlines the main guidelines for the 2007 budget pertaining to other institutions. The main part of my report, however, is dedicated to Parliament’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The report places major emphasis on the need to consolidate what has been successfully achieved in these last few years. No major projects are being contemplated for 2007, which should provide us with enough time to carry out an in-depth stocktaking exercise and enable us to examine and evaluate critically and objectively what needs to be done in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">In a framework of budgetary constraint, we need to implement budgetary rigour in all ongoing activities, ensuring added value for taxpayers’ money. I wish to stress the importance of the application of activity-based budgeting, which would result in more rational and analytical estimates. Moreover, appropriations should relate to specific activities. This would help to avoid cancellation of appropriations at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions have to base their estimates on well-defined needs, avoiding duplication of functions, focusing on core operations and eliminating malpractice and all bottlenecks. In this respect, the institutions are invited to make better use of their resources, leading to more interinstitutional cooperation, which should be conducive to more efficiency and hopefully more savings. It is reasonable to assume that some administrative tasks could be shared amongst the institutions, without the latter losing their independence. This could create economies of scale and increase the effectiveness of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key issue in the report relates to information policy, which addresses Parliament’s objective of bringing Europe and its institutions closer to its citizens. In order to improve the perception that the citizens have of the Union, the implementation of an effective, strong information strategy is crucial. Having said that, however, I still contend that in any information project particular attention should be given to the extent of participation and cooperation of political groups, the pluralism of opinion, the value of its contents and its cost structure. In the final analysis, the level of success of any project will have to be measured in terms of its positive impact on EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of staffing, keeping in mind the exceptionally strong recruitment exercise which took place in the last three years and the Streamline software system, which should be in place by the end of the year, it would be justified to assume that with the exception of enlargement and an extremely limited recruitment of specialised staff, no new employment should take place in 2007, which would result in real economies in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report I also addressed a number of additional priorities for 2007, relating mainly to buildings policy, enlargement, assistance to Members, a statute for Members’ assistants, and training. Regrettably, in view of time constraints, I will be unable to deal with all those topics in any detail.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that this budgetary procedure starts in a context of uncertainty, due to the absence of a new interinstitutional agreement. Understandably, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives but not at any cost. We cannot and should not pay lip service to high-flown buzzwords such as ‘growth’, ‘employment’, ‘research’, ‘social solidarity’ and ‘enlargement’ and at the same time not provide the funds or flexibility to achieve them. In other words, if we really mean what we say, we should put our money where our mouth is.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, and under these circumstances, it would be advisable, at least at this stage, to work on the assumption that we will be retaining the self-imposed ceiling of 20% of Category 5 expenditure. Having said that, however, we know that the self-imposed ceiling is not an irrefutable and fixed law. In future we should not be hesitant to challenge and review this agreement if we are truly convinced that it makes more financial and budgetary sense to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I trust the various guidelines highlighted in this report, if effectively adopted, will improve the efficiency, quality, performance and transparency of the European institutions, offering more added value to the European citizens and hopefully more added value to the institutions’ credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, Parliament’s budget has to be dealt with effectively, responsibly and credibly. This is conditional on several factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have to stop talking about an annual 20% increase or ceiling. We should be talking about and implementing only a budget based on actual needs. We must always consider our accountability to the taxpayer. This will cultivate the credibility expected of Parliament. One important example of this is information policy. We should not embark on ambitious projects, such as our own television channels, but instead we should always ensure that the political groups are actively involved in all of Parliament’s fields of information. We must also plan all the information we give out well beforehand in order to determine the costs of projects and the personnel needs involved. The best example of the provision of information is visitor groups, and now we must really make haste to ensure that the EUR 5 million which was decided on last year is made use of as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would furthermore like to mention one amendment connected with Parliament’s day nursery. This perhaps does not sound like a very politically important issue, but the issue of how we treat employees with children is very important from the point of view of the status of Parliament as an employer. This is a question of equality more than anything else, and we cannot punish single parents and women who have children and who wish to work in Parliament. For this reason, a nursery should be maintained as close to Parliament and public transport services as possible. The proposal that has just been made to stop using the Eastman Nursery is obviously very alarming, and I hope that agreement can be reached on adopting this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I really hope, as the report suggests, that the institutions can submit realistic requests based on budgetary rigour in the light of the current tight financial situation. Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that in all the institutions we can work more cost-effectively, without compromising standards. I would urge all those responsible – which means each of us and all members of all the institutions – to keep this in mind and change our working habits accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight some other aspects of the report that I believe are particularly important. We have had a reference to the area of information and communication. I applaud the emphasis on results as opposed simply to spending. Expensive solutions are not always the most effective. As the rapporteur suggests, we should not be afraid to discontinue tools or strategies that are not delivering the desired results. That means regular monitoring and clear and appropriate distribution of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a reference to information tools. One idea that has been explored is web-TV. I am firmly in support of that idea. Very many young people actually get most of their information from the internet. If it is properly managed and properly handled, it could be a new way of connecting with citizens and pushing forward our objectives. We need to find better ways, but this needs to be properly handled. I am very much in favour of the idea of having web-TV and seeing how all the institutions can work together to get our information across to different members of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My warmest thanks go to him accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">A feature of next year’s budget is once again the establishment of the new activity-based accounting system in all the institutions. Just as the rapporteur insists, it is important that all institutions should adopt the same budget nomenclature, in which case Members of Parliament and other interested parties would be better placed to monitor implementation of the budget. It is important to obtain comparable data on the costs and results of different activities.</p>
<p class="contents">A feature of next year’s budget is the anticipated enlargement. Romania and Bulgaria are very likely to join the EU next year. This will result in special requirements which have to be taken into account. We need to emphasise the importance of organising the linguistic service and the employment of staff. That way we are assured of a smooth transitional phase.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur quite rightly focuses attention on the fact that Parliament’s budget should remain under the 20% mark for all EU administrative expenditure. This will be an indication of Parliament’s administrative discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the intention in next year’s budget is to pay very particular attention to the provision of information. This in itself is a very good thing. We must nevertheless insist that the provision of information remains relevant and appropriate. We cannot afford solutions that are too costly, especially if there is no corresponding benefit to be had.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to focus attention on services for visitors and visitor groups. Although there have been improvements to the current facilities for showing visitors around, they leave a lot to be desired. There are too few rooms for visitors to assemble in, and there is too much queuing. It would be good if there could be greater use made of experts from the EU institutions from outside Parliament on Parliament’s premises so that visitors could be given a more diverse picture of the organisation than they are now. The real costs of visitor groups should be met more effectively. More important than increasing the number of visitors is the more comprehensive reimbursement of the travel expenses that current visitors incur.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to further discussion of the budget, we would hope that next year’s appropriations will be proposed right away in the preliminary draft budget. All too often there tend to be more and more demands concerning the budget while it is being debated throughout the autumn, which should be regarded as unacceptable. With these remarks I wish to express my support for the draftsman’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV)</span> Both these committees have had their day. Their value to the EU is disproportionate to the costs entailed in current integration. The original idea behind the committees was that they would increase the EU’s democratic legitimacy. However, the European Parliament has now in large measure taken over this role. What instead remains is a Committee of the Regions whose own freedom from responsibility is called into question by the majority of the Committee on Budgets’ members.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also seen how both unions and employers have conducted successful campaigns outside the Economic and Social Committee. No one questions the fact that these parties are nowadays well established and can make their voices heard without the help of an EU-funded institution.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the EU should instead seek submissions from the parties concerned directly. In doing so, there would be opportunities not yet taken advantage of for making savings. What is more, it would be advantageous to obtain responses from organisations and parties that are not necessarily completely dependent on the EU budget. I therefore believe that the appropriations in the 2007 budget should be substantially limited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If so many of us are now forced to require the people in our countries to make sacrifices, this can only function, in the spirit of democracy, if we, too, make sacrifices. Reducing Parliament’s budget from EUR 1.2 or 1.3 billion to under EUR 1 billion is the way to achieve credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">To make a couple of suggestions, the many Members who have promised to claim only those travel expenses actually incurred from now on should pay back the surplus. In 2004, just 37 Members accounted for a ludicrous EUR 234 000. We know that EUR 26 million are squandered because of incorrect use of interpreting services. The many minutes of needless silence here cost further millions, and so it goes on. EUR 100 million a year have been spent on something or other, and so we look for something to enter it against. Let us have an end to this. We would have no problem at all in saving the EUR 300 million; and in so doing we would not only spare ourselves negative headlines in the international press, but also earn ourselves positive ones. I am saying this as a pro-European. You will wake up again tomorrow to read something you call scandalous, but no, it is what is happening here that is scandalous. I am sorry, but Europe cannot progress unless savings are made right here, at the top, at long last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When drawing up the European Parliament's budget, we should respond to questions such as these: are we providing the Members with the instruments they require to carry out their duties? Do the Members of the European Parliament have access to interpretation into all languages, to the rapid translation of documents and correct legal and technical assistance? Do the Members have a good computer system and sufficient auxiliary staff? From an external point of view, do the Members receive the correct information? Do the political groups participate in the drawing up and control of that information? Do the Members of the European Parliament need new information systems, or do they need to make better use of the existing ones?</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented specific amendments in response to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should think about minimising the cost. Is it necessary to reach the 20% ceiling? Would it not be better for this House too to be demonstrating that austerity and saving are basic principles of behaviour?</p>

The paragraphs dedicated to our institution – the only democratically elected representation of the people of the EU, in the words of Mr Grech himself – captured my full attention, particularly those relating to visits to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent debates on the Constitutional Treaty and the outcome of the referendum in my country, which I personally deplored, highlight the fact that too many of our fellow citizens are unaware of the meaning and importance of the European Union for their everyday lives. Fears and received ideas often take the place of information. From my brief experience as a new MEP, I have also learnt that, each time that I have had the opportunity to receive visitors – in Brussels or in Strasbourg – no matter what their age, their origin or their socio-professional background, they have returned home convinced, I hope, of the value of the European Union or, at any rate, better informed about it and still interested in it. Of that I am sure.</p>
<p class="contents">One well-known rule of marketing says that a dissatisfied customer tells eleven people and that a satisfied person only tells four people. So let us increase the number of satisfied citizens, because if they are better informed, they are in a better position to spread the European idea among our nations. Yet in order to do that, we must act on the Grech report and increase the number of visitors per MEP. I support Mr Grech’s request. Recently, the European Parliament’s information office for France organised a fascinating European forum in my constituency on the theme ‘A Dialogue on Europe: bringing the European Union and the citizen closer together’. Many participants regretted that the number of sponsored visits to Parliament was not higher. This is a genuine request.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one more point to make: as far as welcoming our visitors and organising our work are concerned, our assistants have an invaluable role to play. They share our lives as elected representatives and freely make their time and brainpower available to us, but wide disparities exist among them, and their social situation is often precarious. As Mr Grech points out in his report, they truly deserve finally to be granted a genuine and meaningful statute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the present context, and given the problems that we are encountering in the framework of the negotiations with the Council on the 2007-2013 financial perspective, this report is timely in taking stock of the financial resources that should be implemented in 2007 for the purposes of funding the main institutions of our Union: Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to lend my support this evening to the requests concerning both the principles of sound management and those designed for the purpose of achieving added value, but I should like us to extend these principles to all of the institutions and also, of course, specifically to the EU agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make even greater efforts to optimise our working tools, the management of information tools, the costs related to data transmission and, finally, our human resources policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for my part, should like to emphasise our communication policy: it must allow our fellow citizens genuine access not only to information, as was explained a short while ago, but also to all the different facets of the Union. In fact, it must be genuinely possible for EU citizens not only to understand the decisions that we make on their behalf, but also to embrace this magnificent blueprint for a society that we are building not only for, but also – I hope – with, them.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we must step up our communication efforts and allocate resources in line with the implementation of a communication policy that is modern, effective, educational and, in short, adapted to our times, not least through the use of tools such as Web TV<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, I feel that I must stress the importance of also making greater efforts to host visitors and the press at the various buildings in which the part-sessions are held. With the prospect of future enlargement, there is no doubt that there is a lack of adequate infrastructure. I very often find myself receiving delegations in the Parliament building’s corridors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I prefer to call it ‘the great giveaway’. Opening your cheque book and asking how much is not my idea of negotiation. Allowing Britain’s contribution to rise from an average of GBP 3 billion net to more than GBP 6 billion per annum from 2007 is totally unacceptable and squanders Mrs Thatcher’s hard-earned rebate. I therefore voted against acceptance of the budget when it came before this Parliament, but I suspect that my reasons were somewhat different to those of most of the other Members of the institution who also voted against it.</p>
<p class="contents">No major political party in my country, except my own, is prepared to campaign honestly and openly on European issues at election time. It is the famous elephant in the room that everybody avoids talking about. They are helped by a supine media that is only too willing to participate in what is effectively a cover-up. Mr Blair and his government may think themselves very clever in avoiding a proper debate on the EU at the last general election. However, there is a downside. How can they legitimately claim to have a mandate for giving away all this extra taxpayers’ money, most of which will be used to subsidise projects in eastern European countries, at the expense of under-funding our own domestic infrastructure?</p>
<p class="contents">I have looked at the guidelines in this report and most of it is just a glorified wish list full of buzzwords like ‘European heart’ and ‘raising the game’. In my view, if the EU really is interested in raising the game, it could start by asking for less money, not more, and it should initiate a major study on the means necessary to return the powers it has taken from democratically elected governments. Well, that is my wish list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
