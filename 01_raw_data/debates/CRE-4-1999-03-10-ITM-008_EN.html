<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Adam </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, as Members will be aware, the trans‐European electricity and gas networks are an important part of our energy strategy and there is provision in the Community's budget to carry out studies as to how these can be best improved. Colleagues should also note that there has been a slight change in the approach. Some of the money is now available for the actual construction of these networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now come forward with a list of additional projects which are felt to be within the Community interest and therefore subject to the codecision procedure. They are summarised on pages 8 and 9 of my report. They are: the connection of isolated electricity networks, the development of internal electricity connections and various gas proposals. Most of the proposals overall relate to gas, to gas interconnections and underground storage facilities. One rather interesting thing about them is the way in which the islands and remote areas of the Community are increasingly considered for linkage to these networks. Perhaps as an aside we might note that it gives an indication of the difficulties we have in exploiting renewable energies, which are often seen as the saviour of the remote areas: our main networks are continually pushing to the limits of Community territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the Commission proposals I am not aware of any particular problem with any of the projects. Some of them have been up for discussion for quite some time. Many of them take gas into areas of the Community which are not well supplied with it at the moment. Of particular importance are the projects which develop gas supplies from Eastern Europe. This is important in relation to our growing demand for fuel from that source.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled three amendments in committee. They have been tabled in order to strengthen the links with offshore islands in the case of Greece and Spain. We understand from the discussions in committee that these are not likely to cause any problem for the Commission or for the Council, so the procedures should not be held up because of this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, an aspect of the overall problem which I would like to mention and which the committee feels is important. Because this is a legislative text I cannot make reference in the resolution to anything other than the formalities that are laid down by Parliament. But the committee feels that we need to have a better link with the broader areas of policy as far as networks are concerned. It is all very well providing the networks, but they affect competition policy. There is some unease for instance in the electricity sector, and in the gas sector as well, that although we provide networks which in theory can work in two directions, all too often they only operate in one direction.</p>
<p class="contents">There is concern also that the ownership of electricity stations seems to be more easily bought in some countries than in others. The way in which the liberalised market operates is certainly more liberal in some countries than in others, and it seems to me and the committee that in approving projects of this type we ought to have more of an assurance that they are in line with the Community's overall competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that we should be looking at how we can extend the electricity grids into Eastern Europe and as far as the former Soviet Union. This is the way we ought to be going. Not only do technical issues arise in this matter but there are also questions of competition and questions relating to environmental impact. We hope that the Commission will look at the whole range of these areas, including oil pipelines – which are not technically part of the network agreement – and bring forward a communication on this subject in the near future. We thought we would get gas from the Caspian area very readily. We know there are demands from Asia for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee welcomes the progress that is being made. We look forward to the expansion and integration of these networks with the countries of Eastern Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sindal </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take part in the Energy Committee"s debate. There are two things to which I would like to draw attention. The first is that there is an inherent conflict in opening the trans‐European energy network to former Soviet states. These states clearly want to be able to operate in a liberal market and earn money. But when, as Parliament's representative, I discuss this with my colleagues in the Lithuanian Parliament, the disagreement is unmistakable. They want to earn money and they want access to a liberal market on different terms from those we wish to see. This is a conflict. Should an Ignalina nuclear power station price‐dump on the European market? That is the question my colleagues put to our colleagues in the Lithuanian Parliament, the Seimas. And the conflict will intensify later today when we discuss Mr Adam's second report. There is an issue of interpretation here when the Lithuanian side maintains that the Copenhagen criteria contain nothing about energy. It therefore becomes a debate in which energy is left out of the real negotiations. And yet we must maintain the demands for closure, even if our colleagues in the Lithuanian Parliament cannot accept them. At the same time, however, we must be realistic, because the funds we are making available and the financing we can offer is peanuts compared to what such an operation will cost.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Adam – whom I should like to thank, by the way, for taking part in the meetings with our Lithuanian colleagues – but I stress that we need solutions which take into account the economies of the applicant countries. It will not work otherwise. I would like to emphasise once again the problem of granting access to a liberal market for some nuclear power stations which should in fact have been closed down a long time ago. It creates a conflict in the political situation, in the political negotiations connected with accession.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Estevan Bolea </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, I do not think that we can combine these reports. That is why I have said that it is one thing to talk about trans‐European energy networks for gas and electricity, and another thing to talk about the safety of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe. We should not combine the two things because, despite the fact that we are pressed for time, we will not manage to understand anything.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the Commissioner that, in my opinion, the ongoing activities of the Commission and the Member States in the field of energy are extremely important. I particularly welcome the development of the gas and electricity networks as this is essential for the liberalisation of markets, to establish closer relations and to improve the standard of living in the countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with all the points made by Mr Adam, which I will not repeat. But I would like to point out that it is important to ensure that we have sufficient resources to extend the networks, and we will support all efforts to that effect. The 1996 decision, which was reviewed in 1997, included 74 projects. The 1999 revision has included a further 17 projects. I would like to highlight one of those in particular, which has already been approved by the Council and which was based on an amendment by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy concerning Spain. It involves strengthening internal connections, which, in turn, will also allow us to improve international exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">So a great deal is being done, as I mentioned at the beginning, and perhaps some projects are moving too quickly. However, all investment in electricity and gas networks will be important, perhaps particularly so in the electricity sector, Commissioner, because it is generally forgotten – or at least, this House tends to forget – that electricity cannot be stored and the service provided has to be immediate, in other words there must be immediate production to meet demand. As a result, we have no option but to develop a system of widespread interconnections, to extend our networks and to also include, of course, the countries of Eastern Europe. Some people say that we do not cooperate enough with the countries of Eastern Europe. We should increase their possibilities of generating electricity. We should help them and they should help us. I would therefore like to thank you for all your efforts and hope that you continue with them. You will have our constant support.</p>

<p class="contents">I am referring to the project connecting the French and Spanish electricity networks with a high‐tension line. The line is practically finished and all that remains is to select the connection point to cross the Pyrenees. And that is where the problem arises.</p>
<p class="contents">The project involves passing this 400 000 volt electric cable through a natural park, a bird reserve and one of the few virgin valleys in the Pyrenees. Naturally, all the political parties in Aragon, the parliament, the government, the trade unions and the chambers of commerce, have directly opposed such a ridiculous plan. As a result, this trans‐European network project has been paralysed for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask us to apply some common sense, in this case as in others, in order to combine essential energy projects with respect for the environment, sustainable development and, above all, the unanimous wish of those who may be affected, particularly when less traumatic solutions actually exist.</p>

Since the German Government"s unambiguous rejection of nuclear power and the announcements by Belgium and Switzerland in recent weeks that they too will not use this technology, we are now faced with a completely new situation. This technology no longer has a future.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that there is also enormous doubt concerning the economic viability of nuclear power stations, as established in the last few days by the Pemelin commission, Euratom loans for the construction of new reactors can no longer be justified. For our own safety we must devote all our efforts to setting new parameters in energy supply. Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz recognised this clearly. Her amendments are a step in the right direction.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Papoutsis, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (EL)</span> Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for his excellent report. The list of projects of common interest was updated in 1997, when it became necessary to add projects to the list, chiefly to take account of the enlargement of the Community. The majority of the amendments and additions that have been put forward by the Commission during the present phase are the result of the rapid development of the situation in Europe, mainly in the gas sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The projects that have been included in the Commission proposal have all been chosen on the basis of their contribution to the general objectives and on the basis of special criteria which determined the direction to be taken in the consultations we had with the industry. Moreover, they are fully in line with the intentions of the Member States, at least insofar as these have been expressed by the experts on energy matters with whom we had the opportunity of holding talks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts all the amendments tabled by the European Parliament. In particular, we accept the two amendments for the inclusion of projects concerning the electricity grids in Greece and Spain. We fully agree that the additions to this list of plans for projects of common interest are wholly appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dwell in particular on the case of Greece. We are providing opportunities for the funding of studies and projects to link the islands to each other and also to the Greek mainland. I think you will recognise the opportunities that are opening up, not only in respect of the energy balance but also for the use of renewable energy sources and, mainly, of solar and wind energy, which we have in abundance in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to highlight the concern expressed in the excellent report produced by Mr Adam regarding the security and the external dimension of the energy networks. In the coming months the European Parliament will present a document on the security of the Community energy supply. I also want to emphasise that the general issue of the external dimension, especially the issue of connections with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, is a constant concern of the Commission. Mr Sindal and Mr Adam had the opportunity to talk about this issue previously. Our desire to keep the European Parliament fully informed on all these issues and on all the developments in the years to come remains steadfast.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission hopes that the motion for a resolution we have before us will be adopted as soon as possible, so that it will be possible for these projects and especially the feasibility studies to get under way. The latter are necessary to show us to what extent the projects are sustainable and can be incorporated into the energy plans of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me once again to thank Mr Adam for the excellent report he has put before us.</p>
