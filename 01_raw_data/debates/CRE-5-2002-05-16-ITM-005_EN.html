<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miranda (GUE/NGL),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, we may not be many, but I am sure we are good! Commissioner Nielson, I believe we are in complete agreement on the need to forge an effective partnership between the European Union and the United Nations, especially in the fields of humanitarian affairs and development. This became evident in the debate and the vote we held in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and I hope it will happen again now. Anything else would be incomprehensible, given the universally declared aims in these fields, especially the challenges and goals of the Millennium Declaration, and, at the same time, the glaring lack of coordination in putting them into practice and the obvious scarcity of resources available thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity, however, that the Commission did not take an all-inclusive, integrated approach to this partnership right from the start and has left the questions of security, peacekeeping, conflict prevention and crisis management until a later date, all the more so since these aspects are known to be connected with the issues behind this communication. Even so, I think the general sense of the communication is positive, especially when the United Nations is taken as a basic reference and pillar for the pursuit of the Community’s aims and policies in these fields.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, to go beyond the contradiction which is quite obvious today, in that, on the one hand the Member States play a major role in the United Nations, especially in terms of their financial contributions to its various activities and its budget or the large contribution made by the same Member States and the European Union itself to the various United Nations funds, whereas, on the other hand, they clearly both have relatively little political influence, particularly in the specialised agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation must change, and it must be based on greater coordination among the Member States themselves and greater involvement by them and the European Union in the various stages of United Nations programmes. Above all, they also need to be more involved in the drawing-up of development strategies and in the planning and performance of activities to be carried out in this field. This will ensure that their respective impacts are optimised and more coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to achieving the stated aims of this partnership, the Commission Communication points out the need for administrative arrangements: the ongoing negotiations on the so-called ‘verification clause’, which would ensure there is sufficient information on the use of available Community funds, must be brought to a quick and satisfactory conclusion; the 1999 EC-UN framework agreement should be renegotiated with a view to changing to an approach oriented more directly towards co-financing operations, output-based budgeting, and upstream programme financing. We share these concerns and these positions, but we also stress that the pursuit of an effective partnership and the achievement of compatibility in structures and procedures must be promoted on three fronts: through strengthening strategic political dialogue in order to define policies and programmes; through strengthening cooperation on the ground in developing countries so as to ensure complementarity and coherence at an operational level; and through the creation of a stable financial framework, with consistent rules and principles in the two institutions, as well as the above-mentioned new framework agreement, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned in the Commission Communication, however, the first step in this cooperation has to be selection of the most suitable partners within the United Nations system. It is equally essential, at Community level, to bring the processes of decentralisation and deconcentration of management and decision-making to a swift conclusion and to ensure that social movements and so-called civil society in general are democratically involved. We shall not get far if we do not put our own house in order first. Achieving practical results in our current reforms is therefore essential in this field too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because of our commitment to this partnership and our desire to see it put into practice, we ask the Commission to keep us suitably and promptly informed of its progress, and, in particular, we suggest that the Commission should include specific information on its progress in its yearly report on cooperation policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would personally like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for incorporating all the amendments that my group tabled for the original draft.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, the rapporteur advocates the need for more effective participation from the Union in coordinating its initiatives with the United Nations, not only on political matters and in decision-making, but also from an operational point of view and in managing projects and specific activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In one of our amendments, which were incorporated into the text, we asked for that operative intervention to take place from the very start when selecting projects, so that the general direction of aid coincides, as far as possible, with the European Union’s objectives in terms of development aid. This should happen even more given that the economic and financial contribution from the Union is significant in terms of quantity and that its contribution in terms of material and human resources is just as significant in terms of quality. This coordination must take place through increasing multilateral institutional political dialogue and through greater cooperation to improve the criteria for ensuring that development aid, whether bilateral or multilateral, is supplementary and complementary. That would not be possible without establishing a stable financial framework for relations between the European Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to highlight the achievements of the recent Monterrey Summit, to which President Fox referred. It is true that in some respects the results of Monterrey can be described as inadequate, but it is just as true that there were steps forward, especially on the part of Europe, as specific commitments were reached on quantifying aid and on a timetable. However, I must say that we are far from the 0.7% that we committed to and which we cannot give up on.</p>
<p class="contents">With the resources available it will not be possible to achieve the objective of eradicating poverty in the world by 2015, which we are committed to, and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that some of the amendments tabled by my group are aimed at making aid more effective and at better management of procedures and greater transparency in the use of resources, as advocated by the Spanish President of the Council when he spoke to the Committee on Development and during Mr Aznar’s speech at the Monterrey Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first thing identified and criticised in the report is the unjustifiable gap that exists between the substantial financial contribution from the European Union and its Member States to UN actions and the meagre political influence that the European Union has in terms of defining and implementing those actions. The contributions from the Member States of the European Union represent 47% of the UN budget and more than 40% of its spending on peace-keeping operations but, with the addition of direct contributions from the Union, our contributions exceed 50% of the resources for the various UN funds and programmes focused on development and humanitarian and food aid.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the status of the Union in comparison with that of the United Nations is insignificant. It has a very small amount of political influence and the visibility of our action is minimal. All in all, here too we are continuing in the unacceptable role of paying but not playing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission Communication gives us a sense of a change towards more ambitious strategies and objectives that are more in keeping with what the European Union should represent on the international stage, and Parliament agrees, perhaps in even stronger terms, with the direction advocated by the Commission. We are thus reaffirming our conviction of the need for a multi-polar international order, governed by the rule of law, so that the United Nations, with greater powers, greater credibility and also greater resources, will simply be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report we are also expressing the urgent need to establish the legal personality of the European Union so that it can cooperate effectively with the United Nations and its various agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Resolution establishes objectives, such as fulfilling the commitments made in the Millennium Declaration in this field, in which the European Union must be a coherent and powerful influence in order to promote the role of the UN as an agent of peace and a guarantee of solidarity, international social cohesion, justice and progress for humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should basically be easy, as the UN and the EU are natural allies. They have the same objectives and priorities, as was seen in connection with the Millennium Declaration in the autumn of 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The report quite rightly reminds us that progress in partnership and above all in the attainment of goals is only achieved to any significant degree on the basis of careful analysis. It is not enough, however, to assess the results achieved so far in the partnership, which are obviously extremely important also. We should also analyse the irreplaceable values of democracy and people’s opinions, which are essential for development. In fact, we are remarkably unaware of those values, which have also served as the basis of the EU’s own development from a Europe that in many ways had been knocked about by wars to the world’s leading political and commercial player.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU at present is a very important negotiator at the political table. There is, however, one area where the UN is a quite indispensable partner: it has solid grassroots respect around the world and the EU does not command that same level of respect even in some Member States. If I may use commercial language, the UN is actually a brand. As an important provider of finance, the EU must be especially interested in the value of this UN brand. The respect and trust the UN has at grassroots level is a resource that cannot be measured in terms of money or replaced.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and its Member States are making significant use of resources in matters of development. Although the sums are huge, they are nevertheless meagre compared to the problems. For that reason, any sort of rationalisation is also welcome. One such way of making the use of resources more efficient would obviously be common representation in the UN and its special organisations. From 2004, when the number of EU members will be much greater than now, this will be more essential than ever. Moreover, as regards our aid donation – 0.7% of GDP – that must continue to be considered a humane target to achieve. Nothing else will do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCartin (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in the parliamentary tradition from which I come, we were not confined to minutes, we were very often asked at a short notice to run down to the chamber and talk for an hour or so, on every sort of insignificant subject. Here we have a different situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy that I am able to contribute on this subject because, while I am not a member of the relevant committee, nevertheless, it is a subject that I have thought about.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning when we were discussing the Lamassoure report on the competences of the European Union and defining the competences, I thought that we should from time to time re-examine the various competences of the Union. Perhaps we have given ourselves excessive competences over the years and taken on excessive responsibilities in areas where it was not all that fruitful and, indeed, could be an irritant to the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have often thought that development cooperation is one area in which we could improve our cooperation. I should have said that I want to congratulate Mr Miranda on his report. His explanatory memorandum sets out what exactly we are doing and, in his motion for resolution, he has drawn up a strategy for more effective policy cooperation between ourselves and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is point at which we have to arrive before that cooperation can really become effective. In the European Union we devote something like 0.3% of our resources to development cooperation as a whole. As the previous speaker pointed out the ideal is approximately 0.7%. I think only Sweden and Denmark have exceeded that, and the average European State produces something like 0.3%, so we have arrived at half the ideal objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European budget itself, we produced something like EUR 4.6 billion in this year's draft budget. This seems like a very small amount of money, but we have the experience of being unable to dispense the money which we provided for many reasons. Nevertheless if there is one objective we should set ourselves in this area, it is to use our economic trading strength and our economic resources for the betterment of the Third World.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at what we are discussing here, the problems we have in the Union today, the rise of the Right or whatever it may be, the slowness of economic growth, the unemployment which we have in parts of the European Union, we find that these are not serious problems at all. And we should not hesitate to tell our people who live in Western Europe today, that they have better lives than any previous generation anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">What is our responsibility as a result? The greatest responsibility we have as a European Union – and this was mentioned by the leader of my party, Mr Bruton, when he addressed this Parliament as President-in-Office – is to extend our good fortune to less fortunate peoples throughout the world. If we could develop a single policy, if we could pool our resources and if we could achieve that target of 0.7%, we would have something like EUR 70 billion to dispense throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In dispensing that money, we could offer to the children of many Third World countries something like the hope that we can give to our own children, something like the life expectancy and opportunities for education. We could revolutionise the world. We should not forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">I was looking at some figures a few days ago. One hundred and twenty years ago there were 1.6 billion people in the world. Europe was one quarter of the entire world. Today there are 6.5 billion people in the world and Europe makes up only 9% of it. We are becoming a smaller component of the entire world. There is the risk that we could become irrelevant. If there is any thing we should do while we still have power and influence in the world, while we still have riches beyond the dreams of the vast majority of people who live on this earth; if there is any objective we could set ourselves which would be a historic achievement for a united Europe, it is to help along the less fortunate peoples of the world. While every individual State in this Union insists on going its own way and designing its own policies for foreign aid, we will not have the political influence, or the material effect on the wellbeing of the people to whom we extend aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Pooling our resources is an ideal proposal on the part of this House. We do not necessarily have to administer it all from Brussels. We can tap into the expertise of the various nations in the various regions of the world. We can distribute responsibility around the various Member States, but we must have a coordinated policy. We must not be competing with each other and we must not be dependent on the United States – or any other country which makes a far lesser effort than we do – to design the policies to which we will contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is a subject we could fruitfully discuss for a long time yet. I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity at least to stretch my thoughts a little bit further than I have ever been allowed to do in this House before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This only occurred at midday because the debate on the reports took longer. If you recall, the vote did not start until 12.15 p.m. The extra quarter of an hour from this morning's debate, which was timetabled until 1.15 p.m. instead of 1 p.m., is now added on to this afternoon. I am also considering our many guests: if we suspend the sitting now, it will be less interesting for them. This was why – without having an opportunity to inform the very high-carat groups – I decided to handle everything quite informally. No one was cut off and if anyone wants to add anything now, he or she may do so. I see that is not the case. In a spontaneous parliament in a Western democracy, there is sometimes more time available than anticipated. Is anyone else able or willing to rise? No. Then I invite Commissioner Nielson to take the floor. I do not want to say that you have unlimited time today, but you do not have to be quite as brief as usual. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I shall begin by addressing some of the points raised this afternoon. Firstly, Mr Miranda's wish that Parliament be kept well informed about progress in our relationship with the United Nations family and that this be included in our annual report. I agree completely. I am grateful to Mr Miranda for referring to the annual report, because it requires something of an effort to produce it, and so I am very touched to hear it mentioned. It may also be useful from time to time in direct discussion in Parliament's committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo wanted more emphasis on the operational side, even at the level of project selection with UN organisations. Basically, the way in which we prefer to work with others is project selection or the formulation of sector programmes, something rooted in the policy of the host government. The consequence will be that we and other donors provide some sort of basket funding enabling a government to carry out its education policy, its health sector policy, or whatever, rather than donors together deciding on a project. It has to be flexible to meet all kinds of circumstances, but basically this more problematic way of planning things is also what we are discussing with the UN family.</p>
<p class="contents">A big problem today is that the restrictions on how we can spend money in the existing Financial Regulation force the Commission to fund specific projects only one by one, through UN organisations. This makes us an inadequate and even sometimes unwelcome partner because we lack predictability and a more long-term perspective. On top of this, we are obliged, on the basis of existing rules and regulations, to insist on having reporting, accounting and auditing on funding through a UN entity carried out under our rules. We are not allowed to accept their way of reporting, unlike our Member States. This is the core of the changes that we presented nearly two years ago to Member States. I will come back to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McCartin, it is absolutely true that we still have a problem about the rate of implementation. However, at the end of 1999, when this Commission took over, it took 4.6 years to spend what was committed at the then rate of spending. The following year this was down to 4.1 years and, at the end of 2001, the figure was 3.6 years. So we are eating into the mountain of unspent commitments. We have not finished yet, but things are moving.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the development of a single policy, we have an overall development cooperation policy statement. It was adopted unanimously by Member States in November 2000 and Parliament has also endorsed this policy unanimously. We are very pleased with that. The main effect of this policy is to focus more clearly on poverty reduction or eradication as the guiding principle for whatever we do. We have never had anything like this before. It covers our global activities, so we have a guide as to what Member States should do. However, reality can be different.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me applaud the positive and constructive report of Mr Miranda. We welcome the support given by that Parliament to the Commission’s approach to building a more effective partnership with the United Nations. I liked the positive tone this afternoon in all the speeches. This has not always been the case. It is a sign of maturity and of healthy self-confidence on our part in Europe that we now approach this in a more active manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations, due to its global mandate, its unique legitimacy and, in a number of areas, its operational strengths, provides an irreplaceable framework to address global challenges confronting the international community. Enhancing dialogue and cooperation to build a strategic partnership between the Community and the United Nations will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of development cooperation and humanitarian aid, thereby strengthening the Community’s contribution to poverty reduction and human security.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a limit to how far we can go. It is, after all, called the United Nations – it is not called the "United Commissions". Our Member States are the real owners of the United Nations as an organisation. But there is large scope for improvement and a very strong interest on both sides to move in that direction. A more active and visible presence of the Commission in the UN also has a positive effect in enhancing the ability of the European Union as such to act and speak with one voice on global matters. This is a very important, and also a very real, aspect. We saw this demonstrated in Monterrey, and it is the intention of the Commission to continue along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We aim at concrete outcomes at policy and operational levels. At policy level we will strengthen the involvement of the Community in the upstream policy dialogue with the different members of the United Nations system. At the operational level we will work towards a transparent, financially credible, predictable and easier to monitor strategic partnership with selected UN agencies, funds and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The follow-up to the Communication we are discussing is already well advanced. Bilateral meetings have been conducted with a number of UN agencies: funds and programmes and the strategic programming dialogues established by ECHO are examples.</p>
<p class="contents">For the country strategy papers, consultation with UN bodies present in the country is now obligatory. This is where the type of cooperation I mentioned in my response to Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo applies. We are discussing further steps with the UN Secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">A broad fact-finding exercise on mandates and capacities of potential UN partners was launched in November 2001 to determine how their key capacities match with our priorities. The first results of this will be available by June.</p>
<p class="contents">A more effective partnership with the UN requires an adequate enabling legal and financial environment:</p>
<p class="contents">We are negotiating the revision of the 1999 EC-UN Framework Agreement, with a view to concluding all this by the end of the year. However, recasting the changes in the Community’s Financial Regulation is still, as I said before, under discussion in the Council. This work will have to be completed fully to realise the intentions of the Communication. This is the real bottleneck.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nation’s response, called "A Vision of Partnership", supports much of the Communication and proposes to go even further. The Commission is drafting another communication that will address the EU-UN relationship at a broader level, as your resolution also suggests. In preparing this communication we will take account of the points made by Parliament in this debate. We look forward to working hand in hand with Parliament in strengthening our influence in the world through this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were many speakers, also in our group, who would have liked to rise during this important debate – and I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his excellent statement – but who were not granted speaking time, while the Members who were granted speaking time left afterwards. I really would ask for this point to be addressed formally to the groups for once as criticism from the Bureau.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish raise is this: I really would ask for more sensible timetabling in future. We had to cut our topical and urgent debate this afternoon from three hours to 90 minutes. Now we find that there is to be a break, and that we will be voting at 5.30 p.m. instead of 6.30 p.m. as originally planned. We would have had plenty of time from now until the original vote at 6.30 p.m. to accommodate three hours of the topical and urgent debate, which is actually what is required by the Rules of Procedure. I would ask you to draw this point to the attention of the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau as well. There was absolutely no reason to cut short the debate. Of course, if no one has anything to say, there is no point in continuing the debate, but when there is too little time available, as was the case with the topical and urgent debate here, there really is no reason why the full amount of time until 6.30 p.m. cannot be used, especially as the people who are here now will also be here tomorrow and the others have already left anyway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we have a packed agenda for Tuesday and Wednesday. We have night sittings and virtually no opportunity even to meet the visitors' groups who come here. We have very little opportunity to do any of the paperwork which still arises during the week of plenary. On the other hand, we have the scrappy arrangements on a Thursday afternoon, when time is wasted. If I look around, I see far more visitors in the galleries than Members in the chamber. There are empty seats everywhere. I believe that it will damage the reputation of this Parliament if we continue with such uneven timetabling. I would urge you to give this matter very careful consideration when drawing up the timetable for next year. I have a draft copy in various versions and it seems to me that we should be dealing more efficiently and more economically with the time available to us. I would very much appreciate it if you could give this matter serious thought and take it into account during planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to address a question to Mr Nielson, with your permission. Mr Nielson, you were just talking about the budget arrangements which are the basis for your endeavours in the field of food aid. Of course, I would like a little more explanation on this point, if I may. I have been dealing with the budget in the committee which I represent for months. We know that it is still with the Council at present, but Parliament, too, has a number of items which it would like to include in the budget. We see that it is taking time. Nonetheless, perhaps you could give us a clearer idea of what this means for you and your area of work. I think that would be helpful for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will gladly pass on this timetabling problem, although we cannot guarantee that it will work out precisely every time. I explained this earlier, Mr Posselt, before you arrived in the chamber. At midday, we finished at 12.14 p.m. instead of 12.00 noon. This meant we had fourteen minutes less this afternoon. This afternoon, for the first time since I took office, each of the speakers on today's list – I am not sure who did not appear – spoke for a shorter time than he or she could have done according to the speakers' list, except for Mr McCartin.

<p class="contents">We do not want to engage in core funding because we are not a nation. But we want to do multiannual programme-based funding – up to three years, say – and to have the accounting and auditing done in the same way as the Member States when channelled through the UN or Red Cross. This will make it possible for them to make better use of us. Sometimes we are not invited to participate in a consortium because of this problem and end up doing less interesting things.

For instance, when we are funding the agriculture research network, which is working globally, we have to find some of the money under the EDF, and some in the budget. This is legally and technically incredibly difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to our contribution to the global health fund on Aids, malaria and TB. Our colleagues cannot understand why we are so difficult to work with. This is why we have asked Member States for the changes in my area of work.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know why progress with the Member States is so slow. This has been slower than I could ever have imagined, and I do not look forward to celebrating the two-year anniversary in July. I know Parliament is supporting the Commission on this issue, and we have to make an effort to get it sorted out with the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
