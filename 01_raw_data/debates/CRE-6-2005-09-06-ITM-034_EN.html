It is certainly not easy, when it comes to problems directly related to our society, that represent the very essence of our society, to unite the whole of Parliament, with the various visions, ideologies and cultures represented in it, around a single text. It is marvellous that Mrs De Sarnez has managed to achieve consensus in Parliament first of all, not to mention between the institutions, on the objectives presented by the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">As you will appreciate when I explain the Commission's position on this report, the majority of the amendments are acceptable to us fully or in principle. Before I discuss the details, however, I should like to hear Members' views on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, I can say the following: the spirit of better regulation is fundamental to what we have to do. That is why we must strive to be as succinct as possible in legal texts and let the stakeholders, as well as the Member States, deal with the details of their implementation. As a Commissioner, I have tried to ensure that every level of our society takes its responsibilities seriously. That also includes, for instance, our media industries.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Parliament's amendments are not acceptable to the Commission in their current form, because they are too detailed or too prescriptive, or because of their substance. However, this debate might change my mind, so I am looking forward to hearing Members' input into this very important social issue. Our work is essential. We are not politicians for the sake of it; we make policies in order for our societies to be better off. When I speak about our societies, I mean the diverse cultures of the 25 Member States, which have to be brought together in one high-level European policy. I know Parliament is capable of that. That is why I shall listen to how Parliament wants the Commission to present its basic proposal to the Council. I have great confidence in what Parliament, in its wisdom, is going to say. Afterwards I shall try to draw the appropriate conclusions from the proposals that have been made. I shall listen with great interest when Mrs De Sarnez sets out Parliament's position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marielle De Sarnez (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the main purpose of this recommendation is to protect minors on the Internet. The Internet is a powerful tool, without borders, open to all, and it gives everyone access to a pool of knowledge and documents and an ability to exchange information that have never been equalled in the history of humanity. In just a few years, the Internet has changed the face of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the legislature’s duty, however, to prevent this powerful communication tool from becoming a harmful, or even dangerous, tool, particularly for minors, who are using it more and more frequently. Indeed, young children now spend more time in front of the computer than in front of the television. They do not know it, but they are not always safe on the Net. They are faced with new dangers that could cause them deep and irreversible trauma.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give you a few statistics regarding this situation, which is becoming increasingly worrying. More than one in three children have accidentally stumbled on violent, pornographic or paedophilic images on the Internet. There are currently about 260 million pages on the web with pornographic content, and 470 paedophilia sites. More than 1.5 million images have been identified on the Net of children, very young children, being sexually exploited or abused. Between 2003 and 2004, Internet child pornography grew by 70%. On average, it takes just 30 seconds for a young person connected to a chat room to be approached sexually by a predator, in other words by an adult pretending to be a teenager for the sole purpose of getting the photo and address of a young surfer and a meeting with him or her. The paedophilia business generates 20 billion dollars a year worldwide. In France alone, it represents a turnover of EUR 50 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with such a situation, we must not and we cannot remain inactive. It is time to protect children and the most vulnerable from all harmful content, whether legal or illegal. It is time to ensure that all those involved take responsibility for what is happening on the Internet. This is all the more necessary now that new technologies are omnipresent and frequently freely available in schools, homes, cybercafés and, soon, on mobile telephones. These are all new ways for young people to avoid any kind of supervision. Today, self-regulation is no longer enough. We must go further by calling on all those involved, politicians, the industry and educators, to take responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, politicians have a responsibility. It is up to governments and ministers for education to implement specific Internet education programmes aimed at all children, teachers and parents. It is also up to them to organise information campaigns to alert public opinion to the dangers posed by the Internet. They should also increase the availability of hotlines for reporting harmful content and encourage the establishment of a European toll-free number accessible to all. Finally, we propose that the Commission should consider creating a domain name ‘<span class="bold">.</span>kid’ reserved solely for content for children.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the industry has a responsibility. The existence of charters, codes of conduct and quality initiatives is no longer enough. It is high time that hosts provided easy-to-use parental software and offered subscriptions to access services intended specifically for children, with automatic filtering at source. It is high time, too, that creators and producers were compelled to provide a description of their sites so that they could be classified.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, educators, in other words parents and teachers, have a responsibility. Children of younger and younger ages are faced with the information and images carried by the Internet. Only the inclusion of an educational approach as part of schools’ curricula will enable improved use of the Internet. Needless to say, this would require training and information for teachers, and also for parents.</p>
<p class="contents">Those, in essence, are our proposals. However, this recommendation also seeks to make a right of reply available in all online media. This right of reply already operates satisfactorily for the written press and audiovisual services, but not for the online media. In most Member States, no provisions are currently laid down. We therefore need to establish minimum principles at European level for exercising the right of reply for all new electronic communications media.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, this recommendation will make it possible, thanks to the support of Parliament, which I would like to thank for the quality of its work, to improve Internet usage and will, I hope, be able to restore confidence. Europe is currently experiencing a major crisis, a crisis in its institutions, its operation, its budget, its identity and its values. However, I hope that, at least, when it comes to the future of our children, we will rediscover our ability to take action and to bring about the necessary changes to protect them. It is the least we can do for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a pity, though, that the legal basis chosen for this recommendation should be Article 157 of the Treaty, which is intended to ensure the competitiveness of European industry, instead of the more appropriate Article 153 on the protection of consumer interests. It is also a pity that the legal form chosen should have been a recommendation that, as is well known, has no legally binding force.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, it is very important that this report focuses on strengthening the protection of minors, through education programmes on information media designed to also enable adults, parents, teachers and trainers to teach minors to make proper use of the information media, especially the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Also extremely important is the commitment to fight the danger of child pornography, especially on the Internet, which is to be combated through informative and preventative advertising campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur also stated, the Internet is a formidable tool for communication with the entire world, but it should be safe and trustworthy. For this reason it is important for the Commission to agree to set up a European toll-free number to supply information on existing filtering systems that can also simplify the submission of complaints to the relevant authorities and the reporting of dangerous sites.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it could be a good idea to promote the adoption of a seal of quality for providers, so that users can identify whether or not a particular provider is regulated by a code of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another important point is the possibility of creating filters that will prevent at source the computer transmission of child pornography and other material that constitutes an assault on human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the Members who have worked together to draft this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The protection of minors and human dignity is an issue that raises fresh problems on a daily basis and increasingly requires both firm action and appropriate teaching in conjunction with a broad spectrum of the people directly involved in the issue. Specific responsibilities must be taken on, good practice must be exchanged and close cooperation must be established between all of the stakeholders involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we must ask ourselves if this enough. Can we expect, for example, that the mechanisms of self-regulation and co-regulation will prove a genuinely satisfactory solution to the problem? What is needed is a sea change of mentality in terms of competitiveness and the production of content, with a view to rejecting the illegal and harmful products that are increasingly invading all audiovisual areas and what are referred to as online services.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue covers areas as diverse as the protection of human rights, the development of personality, family and school education, and the construction of citizenship; in other words, it goes to the heart of democracy and freedom. Consequently, the substance of the recommendation before us should, at various levels and from a variety of perspectives, involve the European and national authorities, the audiovisual industry, and Internet providers and users, along with, on a broader level, authority figures who deal most directly with minors, such as parents, educators and teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential, however, that technology develops and improves so that the measures included in the recommendation can be made genuinely effective: from signalling systems to filtering, from classification to clear guidance on whether a particular practice is legal or otherwise. Direct contact with the minors themselves; they must be in a position to activate protection mechanisms; child protection agencies and similar associations must become involved; and academic training and learning that takes account of these considerations must be provided. Tricky and complex self-regulation procedures should also be promoted, whereby institutions and businesses foster self-evaluation and civic awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">This, for me, is the most difficult aspect, because it will entail a radical change of mindset and behaviour in an era of fierce competitiveness and thirst for profit. Changes must also be made to national laws whereby all of these factors can be brought together and can run smoothly, in such a way that we can achieve at least some of the objectives. Let us hope that this becomes a reality in the not too distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel, Mr President, that we should congratulate Mrs de Sarnez and vote in favour of the report before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Action Plan also includes measures to be taken by Member States with a view to achieving Internet security.</p>
<p class="contents">Internet security means not only the use of smart cards and virus protection, but also protection from harmful and illegal content. I would therefore ask the Commission to strengthen this aspect in future <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe action plans, and at all events to include specific measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In Austria, for example, 80% of young people use the Internet and, of these, 50% go on-line nearly every day. It has been established that there are currently around 260 million pages with pornographic content circulating on the Internet. The trade in sex, particularly child pornography, on the Internet is booming, and so Parliament’s call for the protection of minors cannot be repeated too often. We must also take care that we do not, in our pursuit of increased competitiveness, overstep the bounds of human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures must be demanded and implemented at political, entrepreneurial and educational level. Parents should also be involved. The objective must be to achieve a uniform level of protection of minors and human dignity with a view to improving the competitiveness of audiovisual, information and on-line services in the long term. Filter systems must become more widespread. It should not be possible in future for minors to gain access to websites with content involving, for example, child pornography or racist or violent material. Information and awareness-raising campaigns, continuing education of teachers and instructors, and also the introduction of a quality label for providers subscribing to a certain code of conduct, are urgently required. Although voluntary self-regulation is a good thing, it does not offer adequate protection of children in the face of the proliferation of harmful content.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important is the requirement for the right of reply, which should also apply to all new electronic communications media – audiovisual media and on-line services, in other words – but must of course also take into account freedom of expression and the specific nature of the service concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that this is only a recommendation and that we have to content ourselves with making demands of the Member States. I should like, instead, to see regular monitoring that would enable us to exert public pressure and thereby separate the good from the even better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The huge growth in the reach of the Internet has recently drawn the institutions’ attention to the need to safeguard the rights of minors, which should be protected especially carefully in so far as they are among the main possible users of the web.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware of how difficult it is to find the right balance between two requirements: firstly, that of ensuring that minors can benefit from the wealth of information that the web can provide, and secondly, the duty to prevent the danger that the Internet might become a tool for deviancy and miseducation for minors.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the combating of the circulation of content that is harmful to human dignity and the civil and cultural development of minors is of fundamental importance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is also vital not to slow down but in fact to speed up the process of development of the sector, by promoting new audiovisual media and information services, but in an environment of calm and trust.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, if effective tools to protect the public interest are not rapidly identified and used, these new media and services may not be able to achieve their full potential from the social, cultural and economic viewpoints.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur when she states that, in order to ensure the protection of minors in the utilisation of new information technologies, various actions must be taken simultaneously at three levels of responsibility: politicians, the industry itself and the educational system and parents. I therefore support the proposals she has made, particularly those aimed at implementing information campaigns for citizens to alert public opinion to the dangers posed by an inappropriate use of the Internet, the promotion of training for the trainers, through initiatives specifically aimed at teachers and educators on the risks of the Internet for minors, and the distribution of information packs to pupils and parents.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I urge the European Commission to promote the setting up of a single toll-free telephone number for the whole of the EU, to receive information and complaints about harmful sites. This would make it easy to compile a list of such web domains, partly with the aim of possible legal action against the authors. It would also make it possible to give very useful data and news to the Member States that currently do not have such a reporting service, which fits in well within the strategy of protecting minors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak from experience, for there is much to be found there that bothers me, too, even though I am not a minor. The problem facing us consists in striking a balance between freedom of information, which we all agree is a good thing, and the protection of minors.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, go too far in doing this. In the United States, there were plans to apply certain filters, but these blocked all the information on breast cancer, for example, because the word ‘breast’ was banned as pornographic and all the information on it was filtered out. We should make these risks known: this kind of scenario is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Our vision is one of both children and adults being able to handle the media in an independent and self-confident manner. In order to achieve this, we need websites suitable for children – because, of course, minors require particular protection – on which children can practise constructive behaviour from an early age, that is to say the ability to recognise positive and exclude negative Internet content.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we also need effective filter systems of the kind that do not overshoot the mark. We need systems to filter out pornography, and also racist and violent content; I should like to see these particular filters for adults, too. We need continuing education for teachers and instructors in schools and educational establishments so that they, too, are able to pass on to children the information they require.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we need to introduce a quality label so that we can advertise a good example and thereby subsequently outlaw bad examples. We intend to table an amendment to ensure that there are not too many strict filters, but that these are nevertheless effective and capable of protecting our children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legislation currently in force at EU level is inadequate in the face of such challenges, for example when it comes to safeguarding the mental and moral development of the youngest media consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The most problematic aspect of the Directive is the way in which Member States are absolved of responsibility for the content of programmes broadcast beyond their borders. The notion of state borders, or that of an EU made up of nation states, is an anachronism in today’s media world, and it would be irresponsible to ignore programmes merely because they are broadcast outside national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandatory technical safeguards for programmes that pose a threat to children’s moral development are both outdated and ineffective nowadays, and the sole purpose they serve is to boost the egos of those who incorporated them into the Directive. We are also overlooking the fact that provision is made in Article 22 for a type of programme that should not be broadcast at all, in addition to programmes to which as a rule children should not have access. According to the Directive, programmes should not contain obscenities or pornography, and they may not be broadcast if they pose a threat to children’s mental development. In spite of this, we are incapable of dealing with the problem of harmful programmes being supplied as part of packages to families that have no desire for them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is plain to see this is where we come up against the fundamental principle of freedom of speech, and that this is a battle that we will lose to the porn industry. It is a sad fact that we are incapable of resolving this simple conflict of standards in favour of common sense and the public good.</p>
<p class="contents">The great many loopholes and exemptions in the Directive will encourage Member States, and the European Union itself, to avoid dealing with issues covered by the Directive, in particular those falling under Article 22. A good example of this is the European Commission’s failure to take action over complaints that have been lodged regarding the French Supreme Audiovisual Council’s registration of a porn channel. This registration not only constitutes a violation of the Directive within France, but also now provides a basis upon which applications can be made for the automatic approval of the channel, for example in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making poor use of the opportunity to afford greater protection to viewers by means of national legislation. The De Sarnez report responds to the majority of these challenges and problems, which is why it deserves our support. It should not go unmentioned, however, that the frequent references to the dead and buried draft Constitutional Treaty detract significantly from the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are a great many findings, but the main fundamental conclusion which led to this report is still the European Union's inability to monitor urgently and effectively the application of its individual directives.</p>
<p class="contents">We conclude from the amendments which we had the opportunity of tabling and voting for that, achieving the objectives in the area of the media, led by television without frontiers and the new technologies in the information sectors, such as the Internet, depends on cooperation between politicians, the audiovisual industry and parents, responsibilities which touch on the quality of the product offered, of training programmes for young people, of the protection of dignity and of the right of reply when morals are offended and citizens' personal data are divulged.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I recommend the direct and uniform application in the Member States of terrestrial digital television broadcasting, which will allow parents to control programmes, especially the programmes to which millions of European citizens, including minors, have access as a result of rapid technological progress and, finally, the production of information broadcasts with a strategy against acts of violence against minors and support for victims in the form of psychological, moral and material assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, technology often also has negative results when it is used for the wrong purposes, especially when there is no proper legislative framework to regulate its use. Thus today there are millions of pages of pornography on the Internet and, as our rapporteur Mrs De Sarnez noted earlier, young people spend more time on the Internet than in front of the television.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it is the duty of legislators to ensure that this tool of the freedom of expression does not become a dangerous medium for minors.</p>
<p class="contents">This recommendation has precisely that objective. It proposes innovative and specific measures to control Internet sites with illegal and harmful content.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these measures respond to a considerable degree to citizens' concerns. We need to congratulate – and I for my part congratulate – Mrs De Sarnez, with whom we had the opportunity to hold numerous discussions via our committee and, of course, the work carried out by all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and all the contributions on this issue are now here before the House ready to be voted on. This is a text which is a decided improvement on the Commission's initial text.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the right of reply is concerned, there need to be common principles in all the Member States so that the protection of people's dignity, honour and reputation can be safeguarded effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">If we continue to have different conditions for exercising the right of reply in the various Member States, there is a danger that people facing inaccurate accusations with ulterior motives will be unable to make appropriate use of this right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is, therefore, an urgent need to inform and educate parents, teachers and all of society, and to alert them to these modern-day dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the kind of adult supervision that can prevent all dangers does not exist. Violence in society and violence among young people is growing and various sections of the media and electronic games must also bear some responsibility for this as it is via these very means that young people learn the skills of violent behaviour, identify with negative role models in such games and thus become immune to the suffering of others, or they may even enjoy such suffering, regarding it as something normal.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are fighting terrorism in every corner of the world, such images of violence are helping to support and strengthen it here.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the most important thing in the world of business is generally profit alone, countries must make use of regulations and laws to impose restrictions and also make sure that such restrictions are respected and that appropriate measures are taken when infringements occur. On the other hand, all those who make their living from the media or from young people must take responsibility for their actions. Industries must provide a description of the contents of what they propose to sell, which will facilitate the classification of web pages and make it possible to formulate abbreviations and advisory messages and to provide appropriate filtering.</p>

I would like to point out that the Internet, and the Internet cafes in particular, are the least controlled of all information media. According to a Gallup survey, as many as 63% of Lithuanian children browse the Internet, of whom as many as 33% are 7–10 years old, and only half of the parents show any interest in how their children do that. As many as 90% of those interviewed believe that the most harmful content on the Internet is pornography, whereas 54% of the respondents pointed to violence-related information. 36% of the respondents ascribe such content to paedophilia and 13% to religious sects. I fully support the proposals and amendments presented in the document. The Lithuanian authorities have been quite successful in managing locally produced Internet sites, and we do not have any problems in this respect. However, we face serious problems with content from abroad, since it is virtually outside of any control. Therefore, I believe that following the adoption of this recommendation the Commission should prepare an appropriate directive. Children’s psyches should be protected from damage by any sort of content, and that is a task and responsibility for all of us, including the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please believe me, Mrs De Sarnez, when I say that your report is really very good. We should guard against complacency, however, and always aim high, so I would venture to point out three issues in relation to which I believe we could have gone a little further.</p>
<p class="contents">The content of the report deals with subjects that differ so much from each other that it is difficult to find a common denominator. It refers to the protection of minors on the Internet but also to the right of reply and discrimination. I believe, and I am addressing this to you, Mrs Reding, that we should make it possible for each of these issues to be the subject of a specific recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an express reference is required to the necessary respect for freedom of expression, because the protection of minors that we have laid out in this recommendation could lead to situations in which the restrictions extend to adults, and that would be a violation of Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In this regard I agree with what Mr Sifunakis has said. The United States Supreme Court rejected the Communications Decency Act for a similar reason and because no right is without limits. I do not believe that we should make the same mistake and we should be cautious.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, I would like to point out that I believe the scope of this recommendation has been unnecessarily restricted, because we have talked a lot about minors as viewers of unwanted audiovisual content, but we have not focussed on minors as passive subjects. When we refer to paedophilia, we forget that it is children, minors, who are the object of this type of illicit information and I believe this report should make some reference to that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is undoubtedly a most important task, requiring immediate measures. This is also an international problem going far beyond the boundaries of the European Union, thus calling for the efforts of the entire international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent statistics suggests that children spend more time browsing the Internet than watching TV. In this respect it is necessary to point out that there are about 260 million pornographic sites, in addition to many others teaching how to commit crimes or produce drugs. In Lithuania we have noticed that websites promoting the use of drugs and registered on European servers are immediately transferred to America as soon as any threat arises, and this makes our task even more difficult. Our experience has shown that in an attempt to protect under-age persons from harmful Internet content the self-regulation of Internet service providers is no longer an adequate measure. In so far as the technical means are available, it is necessary to legally bind Internet service providers to install filters that screen harmful sites and to oblige them to block such sites on the server.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that it is absolutely necessary to harmonise the laws of the European Union Member States on the protection of under-aged persons from the harmful impact of the Internet. I welcome the proposal to arrange courses in schools for children and parents on the possible dangers created by the Internet and the means of protection against such dangers, as well as the proposal to open free telephone lines for people to call and report on Internet sites harmful for children. Another justifiable proposal is the idea to create a domain specifically designed for children and to have the content of the sites registered therein regularly scrutinised by an independent authority. In conclusion, I would like to express my strong confidence that in order to avoid even more serious problems in the future we should declare, in the entire European Union, zero tolerance of any harmful Internet material promoting pornography, violence or drug addiction, especially material targeting children and under-aged persons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Parliament has made a number of proposals that I support unreservedly, because we share the same aim: to protect our children.</p>
<p class="contents">God knows that new technologies, in enabling us to communicate freely on a global scale, present us, educators and politicians, with greater difficulties than was the case with the technologies and media we are used to. When something negative is published in the written press, it is possible to prevent it being republished. When a negative programme is broadcast on television, we can stop it. In contrast, on the worldwide web of the Internet, these options are limited. We must be aware that, with the growth of these new media, we have entered a technological reality that presents us with far greater regulation difficulties than for traditional media. That being the case, we have a responsibility as politicians, but also as parents, because I think that most of us here are parents too: what can we do to protect our children in the face of technological realities that can no longer be controlled as they could in the past?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure the honourable Members that, faced with this problem, we have not remained inactive. We have been working for a number of years with the Safer Internet programme, and we have observed that hotlines, for example, work extremely well. We have been able to see the results of these hotlines, where they relate to law enforcement bodies. I will just mention the INHOPE network, which has really made it possible to move things on. Indeed, you must not think that the Internet is completely unregulated. The Internet is regulated in a different way. In the past, for the traditional media, regulation came from outside. For the Internet, it comes from the inside, from the users themselves. It is Internet users that, using our hotlines, using our portals, bring our attention to the existence of negative content. Most of our information on this subject therefore comes from teachers, from parents, from ordinary Internet users and that is one of the new assets for our politicians: we have communities of Internet users who operate by trying to control negative content. As legislators, we therefore have to think differently and make these communities more aware of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, we must not forget the responsibilities of politicians, of the educational sector and, above all, of parents. In this respect, I agree completely with the honourable Members: we must give parents, if they want it, the means to protect their children. Filters are extremely important in this regard, and the Safer Internet programme<span class="italic"> </span>provides funds for testing the effectiveness of these filters, because we must accept that they are not all very effective. One of you had a story to tell about this, and I am sure we could all tell more. We therefore really need to put in the investment to increase the effectiveness of filters.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members, and I can well understand this, are wondering why we have not gone for more restrictive legislation, why we prefer ‘light’ to ‘heavy’ legislation. There are a number of answers to that. First of all, the recommendation of 1998 is still valid. Today, we are discussing an addition, an improvement, further action to what has already been decided. Secondly, we must not forget that this is very much a matter for subsidiarity. Thus, according to the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive, the definition of harmful content and the actions to be taken in response to it come under national authority. This is already a partial response to another question that was asked: why do we not confine ourselves to revising the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive in the future? Well, it is precisely because, in transforming the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive into an ‘Audiovisual Content Without Frontiers’ directive, we would not include all media. It is extremely important, in the field concerning us, for all media to be involved, in other words not just audiovisual media and the Internet, but also the written press.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that was brought up is the right of reply. In relation to this right, our Member States – because this subject, too, comes under the subsidiarity principle – have had good experiences with coregulation. I consequently believe that we should continue to use coregulation.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, Mr President, I must stress that the main aim of all the actions that will be taken thanks to Safer Internet, thanks to ‘Television Without Frontiers’ which will become ‘Audiovisual Content Without Frontiers’, thanks to all the regulations, both light and not so light, that we are going to apply, is and remains the protection of our young people. I would therefore like to say to the honourable Members today that I was very pleased to hear from all sides that, in addition to paedophilia, which is a crime, in addition to pornography, which is still banned in our various countries, by various cultural methods, it is also, and above all, violence that causes a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In the five years that I have now been responsible for media matters, I have said this time and again: it is not only pornography, but also violence that is very damaging to our children. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for recognising this fact and for helping to go down this route, because, at present, violence is not recognised in national or international legislation as being as damaging as pornography. We have therefore taken a huge step forward in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think, Mr President, that what Parliament really wants to hear is what the Commission intends to do with Parliament’s amendments on which various speakers have commented this evening. There is a whole series of amendments that the Commission will accept as such or with only minor alterations. It is late, so I will not go over all of them. I wanted to start on a positive note: the Commission accepts almost all the amendments, albeit with a few alterations to which we can return later.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Parliament with regard to hotlines and filtering. I would add that I have promised and acted to ensure that part of our research budget is invested in improving filters, because, quite frankly, what we have at the moment is not great. In that vein, Mrs De Sarnez, Amendment 33 on hotlines and filters is one of the amendments that the Commission accepts. We will support it in our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have some problems with Amendments 3 and 5, particularly because they refer to the Constitutional Treaty, which, unfortunately, we do not have. We cannot make commitments based on a text that we may wish for with all our might, but that is not yet available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment 13, you will be aware that the Commission has proposed dates for the transition from analogue to digital, but this aspect has no place in the recommendation as such. In addition, the dates are some way off, as the transition is scheduled for 2010 and the analogue switch-off for 2012. I do not want to get involved in fortune telling.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment 27, which aims to reduce food advertising specifically targeted at children, although I agree with the principle, it comes under the subsidiarity principle and I must say that self-regulation of the industry is working quite well at the moment. What is needed, from the point of view of Parliament, from the point of view of the Commission and from the point of view of the Member States, is to apply pressure for this self-regulation to be truly effective in all aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment 28, we think that it does not add anything and that it risks causing confusion because there is industry and there is industry, so why not all industries? With regard to Amendment 29, you should be aware that, in the assessment systems, local, regional and national cultural differences also come into play. These cultural differences, for which, as you know, I have fought continually, do not suit me in this particular instance, but they do exist and they must be taken into account. As for Amendment 32, concerning discrimination created by false and stereotyped images, we must, as some of you have already said, strike a balance between the protection of children and freedom of expression. On the subject of Amendment 34, we think that the original proposal will be more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments 23, 37 and 38 on the right of reply, which was the subject of almost all of your speeches, I have got the message. I know how close this right of reply is to your hearts. However, moving from indicative guidelines to minimum principles, covering all audiovisual and online information services, replacing ‘assertion of facts’ with ‘inaccurate facts’: all of this raises some major legal problems. I am therefore inclined to listen to the Commission’s legal service, which has warned me of the possibility that these concepts could be falsely interpreted. That is why I prefer to err more on the side of legal certainty. In relation to Amendment 39, too, I prefer the basis of the Commission’s text.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we agree on 95% of the elements presented and we agree 100% on the values that we share and that will be the values of our society in the future, based on respect and on the way in which we protect the young people of today. That is what is essential here. The fact that we are implementing the best methods for achieving these results seems to me to be an element of that <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> that the Commissioners, and also the MEPs, know so well because they are in contact with the national and regional officials who will have to put into practice a large proportion of what we have decided today. Therefore, yes to the values and yes to almost all of the Commission’s proposals. Thank you to the rapporteurs and thank you for your very committed speeches this evening, which I welcome on behalf of our European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
