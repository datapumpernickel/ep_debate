<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform. This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions. Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully. Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do. We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.</p>
<p class="contents">We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the ‘Dialogue on Europe’ in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course. We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament. We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work. We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media. Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State. The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership. We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament. I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits. We want to encourage debate among the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Without presuming to lecture you – God forbid – or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face. I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed. So this is what we are going to do. We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve. Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires. Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I have to say for the moment. I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November. I have also heard Commissioner Barnier’s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme. </p>
<p class="contents">If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?<span class="bold"> </span>It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative – which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments – and our committee’s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings. </p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission’s initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November. I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform. These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them. </p>
<p class="contents">I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March. I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission’s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.

<p class="contents">In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF. As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used. We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House’s work and perhaps by going down the same road. This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests. </p>
<p class="contents">We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community.

I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.

My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition. Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957. This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values. This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity. This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate. The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust. </p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission. Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet? </p>
<p class="contents">My second question is of a critical nature. The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency. If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands. My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible. The documents will in the main be open working documents. Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission’s viewpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe. We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums. The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised. These are the modern means to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people. Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe. I have evidence that this is possible. The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions. Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ. Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties. Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.

So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion. I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States.

It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself. In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence – that is to say, the Residence Directives – ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting. Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States’ election processes? It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments. Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?

I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology. In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people. This will therefore be our rule. We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues. I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical. This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals. It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots. If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity. We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this. It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam. It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies. The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7. However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general. </p>
<p class="contents">We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War. Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
