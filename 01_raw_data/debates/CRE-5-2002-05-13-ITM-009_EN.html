<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gröner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to thank all those who have contributed to this White Paper giving European youth policy a new impetus, and in the production of which a unique consultation process has involved thousands of young Europeans. Parliament, too, has made its own important contribution in a public hearing which attracted a great deal of attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst emphasising that the main responsibility for young people lies with the Member States, we support the proposed new forms of cooperation (a) by means of open coordination, which, though, in our view needs to be given tangible form by an interinstitutional agreement, and (b) in the form of mainstreaming, that is to say, the taking into account of young people's interests in other policy areas. Anyone, though, who listened attentively to the young people, heard them speak not only about such issues as education, lifelong learning, mobility, employment, social integration, anti-racism and the combating of xenophobia, but also about other important issues such as equality of opportunity for young women and young men, immigration, addiction to alcohol and other drugs as being important areas calling for action in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee expects of the Convention that it will come up with proposals as to how young people can be actively involved in the construction of a democratic Europe, as Europe still seems to them to be a long way away. I, as rapporteur, believe it to be necessary to expand the chapter on young people in the Treaty on European Union and to further raise the profile of children and youth policy in the Commission as well, especially in view of the outcome of the World Summit for Children in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">European youth organisations, especially the European Youth Forum, made a substantial contribution to the gestation of the White Paper, in which we now call on all actors, ranging from researchers to municipalities by way of the national representatives, to develop new forms of participation which should also be for young people outside youth organisations. Conceivable options range from youth parliaments and conventions to competitions in schools and sport clubs. The political parties also have a great responsibility and should involve young people to a greater degree, encouraging them to take up political office. That will become very important in view of the elections to be held in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the greater promotion of voluntary work for young people, but this is a kind of informal education and should be given recognition as such; legal and social protection for young people also needs to be improved. The motion for a resolution contains an array of further proposals, for example for making better use, for young people's purposes, of the Community programmes or indeed the Structural Funds. In order to do that, they will have to have better data with which to work. The Pisa survey in the educational field has shown how a youth report to be drawn up every three years, with comparable statistics and indicators from the Member States and the candidate countries, can serve as a significant basis for a broadly-based debate and for further political decisions, but there is a need for other coordinated measures as well, for example – as the catastrophe in Erfurt shows – to prevent violence.</p>
<p class="contents">An Internet portal is not a sufficient discussion forum for the purposes of informing young people, as there are marked geographical and gender-specific, as well as social, differences in the way the Internet is used. My proposal is for innovative material to be developed in the language young people use and for the European Union's youth work to be presented to the wider public in a week of activities every year.</p>
<p class="contents">But, ladies and gentlemen, nothing is any good unless it results in action. The White Paper on youth policy can only be a first step, a first and important step set in motion by the Commission in order to establish contact with many young people and with actors. Such a thing cannot be had for free. There must now be measures that cannot be financed out of the Youth Programme, 99% of which is exhausted, and so these good proposals cannot be realised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Ministers now has to take a quick decision on this at the end of this month. We need a green light for the White Paper. Then we must act together to swiftly implement further proposals, including some on the Budget, for I was at many of these European and also national conferences and spoke with the young people, and I can tell you that nothing could be more devastating to our work with young people and to their view of us than for their high hopes not to be fulfilled and for no measures now to result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although a step in the right direction, it is a concept capable of further development. During consultations with the Commission, European youth associations clearly expressed the view that this White Paper should give a higher profile to gender-specific issues. I incorporated this concern in my opinion for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and put it forward emphatically.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal opportunities and the gender issue do not only affect us adults – quite the opposite, in fact. It is precisely in schools and in youth work that choices are made about the self-evidently equal rights of girls and boys, of women and men. European youth policy, too, must attach great value to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the report's proposals for greater participation by young people at every political level, for better provision of information of specific relevance to them, for the promotion of voluntary service by young people and for the highlighting of their interests in the Convention and in discussions on the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">However constructive the proposals may be, though, we must not lose sight of the principle of subsidiarity. Youth policy is primarily a task for the nations, regions and municipalities, but it is Europe that can create the framework for it. I take a very critical view of the open coordination that is proposed in connection with this, which, in the form proposed, comes across as incapable of definition and diminishing the role of Parliament. The family, too, is a focal point in life as it is really lived by Europe's young people, something of which the White Paper and the report take insufficient account. The family, too, is a youth policy, and must be protected and reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the White Paper, taken as a whole, as having a good approach and as giving Europe's future youth policy some impetus, but we must take dialogue with the younger generation further and invest a great deal of commitment in pushing for what results from it to be implemented. Only then will this initial impetus become the forward-moving process that Europe's young people have every right to expect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that 75 million of Europe's citizens – in which I include those of the enlarged Europe – are young people between the ages of 15 and 25, but the falling birth-rate and simultaneously rising life expectancy mean that our society is getting older. The proportion of the EU's overall population between the ages of 65 and 90 will rise from 16% to 21% between 2000 and 2020, whilst that of 14 to 24-year-olds will be as low as 11%. This disparity in numbers between young and older people will bring about considerable change to relationships at various levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to find answers within our own society in order to meet these challenges. We too are called to take measures to accompany and support young people above all, in order to avoid social tensions and also adverse effects on our education systems and the labour market. After all, the present system of European cooperation on youth issues has been stretched to its fullest extent and can no longer cope with the problems that have to be tackled. We all know that investment in the young means investing in something that will make up the wealth of our society both today and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As my lady predecessor on the floor said, youth policy falls mainly within the competence of the Member States. The new White Paper on youth policy is meant to point the way towards a new kind of European cooperation in the youth sphere. It is indeed the case that the White Paper is as yet far from ideal, but it does need to be implemented as a matter of urgency in order to increase young people's involvement in the integration of Europe and in shaping our future. The White Paper is a logical step for a forward-looking youth policy. I would like at this point to thank Commissioner Reding for her initiative in the past, but above all for her commitment and for the way she got to grips with the task of listening to young people and involving them directly. I see that as the right step on the right road, as youth policy, policy for young people, cannot be made without young people; it must be made with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the White Paper is not yet perfect, it is, as I have said, a step in the right direction. On behalf of my group, I ask you to support it when we vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason it is only proper that issues of youth should be discussed at EU level. The quality of youth policy in the Member States can be improved through European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is gratifying that the Commission should have tried to implement European governance in practice and is offering young people opportunities to influence the decisions that relate to them. The consultation process prior to the White Paper aroused high expectations among young people as to its content. These hopes, however, have perhaps not been entirely realised. It is not enough that young people are merely listened to. We have to look for workable solutions to the problems that young people feel are serious. Although the majority of young people in Europe are doing well, youth unemployment and exclusion have become permanent social phenomena. Closely linked to this is the fact that deprivation tends to pass from one generation to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">The value of participation on the part of young people in decision-making that relates to them cannot be taken for granted. Bringing children up to prepare them for responsible citizenship is a big challenge for parents, teachers and trainers, and us politicians. We are looking at very fundamental questions of democracy when people are not interested in voting. For example, in Finland we are trying to show young people how to use their influence through youth councils, which are groups set up specifically for young people that strive to gain recognition for issues that are important to young people locally. We have also organised youth elections in which young people can express their views on state policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The structures in place have not yet, in themselves, inspired any motivation to exercise influence. In a youth seminar I organised in Helsinki in April, one in which Mrs Gröner also took part, a certain young person wisely stated that participation must be seen both as a right and a learning process. Citizenship is learned and put into practice through action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s White Paper is an excellent start to developments in youth policy.

It is proposed that greater account should be taken of young people's needs when framing measures in different policy areas in the European Union. We must give young people the opportunity to demonstrate active commitment by getting involved in public life.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, the Pisa survey came up with some sobering results. It is for that reason that I advocate a reform of schools policy which would have to incorporate the aspirations of students and young people. I do think that young people's participation in public life is especially important. Today, young people are involving themselves less and less in traditionally structured organisations such as political parties and trade unions. This is seen especially in the extent to which young people take part in elections at national and European level. It is young people in particular whom we must encourage to stand as candidates at local, national and European level, and we must actively support them in doing so. I urge that young people's votes and opinions on political matters should not be shrugged off as an irrelevance.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it particularly regrettable that the Commission White Paper devotes too little space to the gender angle, an aspect that I believe cannot be excluded from consideration. Young women must be promoted in every respect, as women still do not have the same opportunities as men in the labour market. Top jobs are mainly held by men. The unemployment rate is higher in Europe for women and women earn on average less than their male colleagues. I commit myself to women getting the same opportunities as men in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the fight against racism is given an important place in the White Paper. This is especially important in view of the way in which people are discriminated against on the basis of their different skin colour or of their belonging to an ethnic or religious minority. We have to encourage young people to reach out to other cultures, which I am convinced leads to each enriching the other. Dialogue promotes mutual understanding among peoples in the cause of peace. I am committed to people in Europe not only living alongside each other, but, above all, being able to live with each other. Our willingness to reach out to those who are different or foreign gains us a view of the world that is cosmopolitan and tolerant. Youth policy must be accorded a particular value at national and European level, and this means that schemes for young people need to be appropriately financially resourced. I consider it particularly important that Community programmes should give adequate support to projects that benefit young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our European home must not be built without taking into account the concerns of young people, and so I urge that their conceptions of Europe's future should have an influence on the Convention. If we ignore young people's interests, our European home will rest on unsteady foundations, for the young of today are tomorrow's future! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The White Paper really does give all us politicians, at both European and national level, the opportunity to take stock of our responsibility in the light of this objective. If we are honest with ourselves, then we have to admit that we have neither the frame of mind nor the practices needed for our young people to prepare to become proactive citizens in their national and local societies and tomorrow's responsible European citizens. It is true that continuing unemployment and the social problems which come with it, often poor standards of education and teaching and insecurity about the future disappoint and alienate youth from the rest of society. At the same time, however, as studies have shown, they want new social relations and new forms of intervention. The rapporteur has taken the right approach here, for which she has our warmest thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, few countries have the structures or institutional framework needed to allow young people to play a specific and fundamental role in society. The Member States of the European Union have differing experiences in this area as a result of differing administrative and regional structures and political traditions and promoting best practices will be one hundred per cent beneficial here. But at European level, Commissioner, we should be giving the youth of Europe a better chance to get acquainted, cooperate, support each other and prepare their common future.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the range of European student exchange programmes, for example, there are huge discrepancies between education systems. When it comes to recognising diplomas, there are universities which prefer to throw up obstacles to students from other Member States of the European Union than to accept them and bring them into contact with their own student circles. Be daring in your initiatives, Commissioner, the European Parliament is right behind you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Exactly what does a capitalist society have to offer its youth? A society in which everything can be bought and sold. More to the point, what does the policy of the European Union have to offer? An education system which is incapable of passing on basic knowledge, which replaces education with training and which excludes a significant proportion of young people on the basis of class criteria. Non-existent job prospects or, at best, one paltry part-time job after another with long periods of unemployment in between, no social insurance, easy prey for profit-greedy big business. Individualisation and competition instead of collective action and fighting for demands. The sub-culture of television, the sport of hooligans, the fool's paradise of drugs. And when our young people dare to protest, in my country they are more often than not dragged off to court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's White Paper does indeed identify some of the problems, but it fails to analyse the causes or offer any solutions. It is mainly interested in assimilating young people, in pushing them in directions which cause no ructions in the system but which leave young people with no way out. It promotes the empty European ideal, participation in institutions of the system which young people's experience and intuition have taught them to shun. It even promotes so-called voluntary service as the highest form of social solidarity and entrepreneurship as the antidote to unemployment. It underestimates the serious problem of drugs, on which it takes an almost neutral stance. Clearly it is an attempt to acquit the system and persuade us that there is a way out within it.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Communist Party of Greece is concerned, there is no way out for the young without disputing the foundations of the class system. It is only by fighting for a society that respects people that young people will be able to acquire the wherewithal to make their way in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the White Paper which was proposed by the Commission last November is the response to the challenge that I set in November 1999, to the Council of Ministers for Youth and to all those who are responsible for young people in our Member States. The challenge is, ultimately, to listen to young people and to avoid developing policies for young people without their input. This appears to be an innovative approach, and yet it is only logical! It is perhaps surprising that it took so long for common sense to set in and for us to started to listen to young people and treat them as active partners in shaping all future policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Parliament, and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, for the unwavering support provided since the very launch of the new policy. This work has been patient, persistent and, I believe, as do the young people in our Member States as well, it has shown that the European Parliament is on the side of young people, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper has given a new impetus to youth policy. However, as Parliament has made very clear, a new impetus is all well and good but we still need concrete measures. The ball is now in the Council’s court. The forthcoming Council of Ministers meeting on 30 May will enable us to determine the will of the Member States to push forward this matter whilst observing the subsidiarity principle, which is respected by the Commission in this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed new framework of cooperation is based, on the one hand, on applying the open method of coordination in the field of youth policy and, on the other hand, on taking greater account of young people in the various European policies, over and above those of the youth programme. And I am pleased that Parliament supports this two-fold approach, that it is making proposals – which I have listened to and made a note of – and I would also like to assure Parliament of my personal commitment to involving it as much as possible in this new approach. I am aware of the structural shortcomings of the open method of coordination, but it is also the best method currently available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can say to you, therefore, is this: let us move forward along this path. I will involve Parliament and I also insist that Parliament declare itself competent whenever youth policy is discussed, whether in areas for which I am responsible or in areas which are the responsibility of other commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as you know, the White Paper is proposing nine priorities. These priorities were identified during consultations with young people. I am slightly wary of further increasing the number of priorities, because my political experience tells me that if we overload our agenda, it will become increasingly difficult to control things. I am therefore rather more inclined to say this: it is better to have fewer priorities and to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is a pleasure for me to accept Parliament’s invitation to provide a regular progress report. I shall focus on the progress achieved in European cooperation rather than on the situation of young people: I think that this is what is important, namely to see where we are going and what progress we are making each year. Your proposal to hold an information week on the activities of young people is an excellent idea. I shall undertake to organise this and, you are right, we must, in particular, do more to improve awareness of the youth programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I fully support the proposal to take into account the situation of young women in all the aspects which concern young people, not only here in Europe, but also in the relations that we have with third countries. We discussed doing this as part of the Tempus project, where we really must improve the integration of women. In the same vein, for the EuroMed Youth programme, I urged the ministers of the North African countries to give young women the opportunity to participate in the young people’s exchange programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, Mr President, the next milestone in the process of translating the policies proposed in the White Paper into concrete measures will be 30 May, the meeting of the Ministers for Youth. I firmly believe that the arrangements for the future cooperation for young people, as well as the major priorities, can be decided at this meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am extremely pleased to note that everyone is helping to give a new impetus to youth policy. I would like, to move things forward rather than to bring a close to the subject, to thank the European Parliament: you have been an enormous help to us, and I also know that you will continue to help young people, so thank you again, and let us work together in developing our youth policy.</p>
