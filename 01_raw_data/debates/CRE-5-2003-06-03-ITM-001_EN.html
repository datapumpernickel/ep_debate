<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate on behalf of the Commission and, above all, on behalf of Mrs Diamantopoulou, who regrets that she cannot be here today because she is attending a meeting of the Social Affairs Council in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached the final stage in our joint effort to reform the European employment strategy. All the institutions have worked together to reach a good compromise that is now fully in line with the European Council's conclusions, that takes on board most of the European Parliament's views and that is, whilst less ambitious, close to the Commission's initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Our ambitions should reflect the scale of the challenges we face. Firstly, full employment: to deliver full employment we need to create up to 22 million jobs if the Union of 25 Member States is to reach the 2010 Lisbon target.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as quality and productivity is concerned, this means ensuring not just more jobs but also better jobs. We must take a positive approach to managing economic restructuring and we must reverse the slowdown in productivity growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards cohesion and inclusion, we must tackle increasing social inequalities and persistent regional disparities. This, of course, will be an even more challenging ambition within an enlarged Union. These challenges can only be met if we ensure that all relevant players are closely involved in the employment strategy and that they all work together.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the main elements of reform? Firstly, stability. Through this reform we have to respond to the short-term challenges of the slowdown in our economies, and face up to the longer-term challenges of reform. A more stable set of guidelines covering the period up to 2010, with a mid-term review in 2006, should help us to respond to both short- and longer-term challenges. In principle, these guidelines should remain unaltered for at least three years.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been successful in presenting more focused, simpler and results-oriented guidelines that concentrate on a limited number of major priorities and set out clearly the results we are aiming for. The focus on results rather than process means more emphasis on the use of targets and indicators to benchmark progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received considerable support from Parliament in this respect. Whilst we could have gone further, I welcome the fact that a reasonable number of well-focused targets remain. Emphasis on results also demands that more importance is placed on the recommendations to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In streamlining the employment guidelines and the broad economic policy guidelines it is also important to recall the advantages of this new streamlining of the employment policy coordination and the broad economic policy guidelines. We have to make sure that the simultaneous timetable for the two sets of guidelines fosters complementarity and creates a more coherent policy coordination at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the new priorities. I am not going to refer to all the specific guidelines, but I would like to refer to the three main challenges they address.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the adaptability of people and enterprises must be promoted. Adaptability requires a good balance between flexibility and security in the labour market. It also requires investment in entrepreneurship and in helping people and enterprises to cope better with the effects of economic restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to achieve full employment, we must see how we can increase the labour supply further. We must better exploit the potential of all groups of the population. We must increase the participation of women and older workers on the labour market. We must fully integrate immigrants into the labour market. We must transform undeclared work into regular employment. Parliament's support was extremely important in securing an agreement on this specific issue. We now send out a clear signal that we want not just more employment but also better employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, investment in human capital is increasingly at the heart of the issue of creating more and better jobs. It is crucial for more employment, more productivity and also more inclusion. This calls for redirecting resources in favour of investment in human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now address the views of this Parliament. I regret the timetable difficulties which Parliament has had to face. I understand your concerns and I know that both the Council and the Commission have done their utmost to take account of your views. Despite those difficulties, the revised guidelines I am presenting today strongly reflect the views of Parliament. Indeed, your views have provided significant added value in a number of notable areas.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a reference to reducing unemployment. Parliament fought hard to include a reference on the need to reduce unemployment. I agree that it is vital to illustrate to Europe's citizens that these reforms aim to tackle directly the areas of most concern to them. I am happy to report that we now have such a reference in the opening paragraphs of the guidelines, even though Parliament's request went further in suggesting a new target relating to full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area concerned is that of a fourth over-arching objective on equal opportunities. As a result of Parliament's opinion we now have a stronger set of guidelines giving a higher profile to gender issues. The revised text does not go as far as including a fourth over-arching objective, but in two important areas the guidelines have been strengthened: firstly, the introductory text makes it clear that equal opportunities and gender equality are vital for making progress towards all three objectives; secondly, we now have a more complete specific guideline addressing gender equality as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning a higher profile for the entrepreneurship priority, the Commission very much welcomes Parliament's comments that the scope of the entrepreneurship guidelines should be widened to cover support for all SMEs, rather than just new start-ups. This proposal has been taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards a more visible role for local and regional actors, the new proposals better reflect the importance of ensuring the close involvement of local and regional actors in the employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with Parliament's request, we now have a specific guideline on regional disparities that recognises the crucial role played by local and regional actors in addressing those disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions on governance were rather difficult. It is obvious that this is a very sensitive issue for Member States. However, it is important to stress that the success of the new European employment strategy ultimately relies on improved delivery and better governance. This is even more vital when we account for the needs of the new Member States, who have openly recognised the crucial importance of the issue. This is yet another area in which we very much welcome the strong support of the Parliament. The guidelines now clearly express the important contribution of parliamentary bodies for improving the governance of the employment strategy. Despite the fact that this falls short of your proposal that national parliaments should adopt the national action plans, it does however reflect important progress in ensuring a better governance strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in taking on board many of your expectations, these revisions now reflect the shared views of all parties. The revised guidelines present concrete objectives, priorities and targets and strengthen the delivery and governance of the strategy as a whole. As such, they are an excellent basis to support national employment and labour market policies for the years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmid, Herman (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, it was gratifying to listen to Commissioner Vitorino. Our work can have practical results, something which is needed. We have economic stagnation and growing problems in the labour markets in the EU. The resulting antagonisms concerning ‘the right policy’ are increasing, something we have noticed in this Parliament too.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been my great ambition throughout my work as rapporteur to try, despite the difficulties, to unite Parliament behind a common policy. The basis for this policy was the Lisbon strategy, according to which economic and technological development should be combined with a concentration on work of good quality, cooperation between the parties, production and, especially, solidarity with weak groups. We have therefore put forward a range of proposals. I am able to summarise them very briefly now, because Commissioner Vitorino has already commented on some of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have proposed increased attention to unemployment. That is important, for it is not enough just to increase levels of employment, as is done in periods of prosperity. That is not the same as combating unemployment. There can be access to the labour market at the same time as the long-term unemployed remain long-term unemployed. There is therefore a need for attention to be paid to this area as an important measure of renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have placed considerable emphasis on the fact that, in an economic situation like the present one, new jobs and new businesses are needed, something that certainly also requires political initiatives. We are now presenting a programme for entrepreneurship and new jobs that is much more comprehensive than the one contained in the Commission’s guidelines. At the same time, we are maintaining and emphasising our demand for quality, sustainability and a perspective upon the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we focus much more intently upon the equality perspective than the Commission’s proposal does. Above all, we propose that equality be made into an overarching objective alongside the three objectives proposed by the Commission. The Council is clearly not ready to adopt this as yet, but we should no doubt continue to exercise pressure. It is not the last time we shall have that opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we have put forward clear demands for regional and local employment strategies. I am pleased that there are clear responses to these demands, for it looked rather bad for a time when this feature had disappeared from what was the last guideline. Now, it has been reintroduced, which is important, because there is a need to be able to mobilise people and businesses from below if we are to be able to create the 22 million jobs talked about by Mr Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have agreed to recommend that the Member States’ parliaments adopt positions on the national action plans. They can then be more firmly rooted and combined with national employment policies. The problem has been that European employment policy has not been linked up with, or integrated into, the national policies. There has therefore been a considerable lack of efficiency. I appreciate that the Council is not ready for this, either. Perhaps we ought to go via the Member States and ask certain Member States at some point to raise this issue in the Council. They will then have Parliament’s support.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also agreed about other issues, a fact I think we can be proud of. We made no less than 16 compromises in the committee and reduced more than 160 amendments to a relatively manageable number. I should naturally be disappointed if, after all these compromises, it emerged that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats were still not completely satisfied. There therefore remains a certain lack of agreement, something upon which I wish to comment shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the PPE-DE Group wishes to strengthen the Commission’s wording on immigration and immigrant labour and does not want this matter to be addressed in the guidelines. Yes, this is a ‘hot potato’ in a number of Member States, but that cannot be helped. Irrespective of whether they border upon the EU or are in a particularly exposed position, all European countries face a common global reality whereby we are seeing increased immigration across our borders, something we must deal with in a document on employment policy. I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 62.</p>
<p class="contents">Another disagreement concerns tax policy. There are quite a few amendments about this. I think that tax systems are very national in character. If we are to come up with views on this, we must express ourselves in very general terms. It is impossible to produce practical proposals on tax policy for 25 countries. I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 66 by the PPE-DE Group, which is very radical and demands a general reduction in tax for both individuals and businesses in all the Member States but says nothing about how the financial position is to be regarded. In my own country, Sweden, reducing the tax burden is not at all the thing to do, but I appreciate that matters are different in Germany and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I just want briefly to say that the Liberals’ amendments on tax issues are of a quite different character. They are interesting, but very drastic. It is a question of shifting the tax burden from personal taxation to environmental taxation and taxation of consumer goods. That is something I consider to be worthwhile, but it is not something we can probably decide in this type of document.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to say that we have, in general, reached agreement. It is very important for us to be able to agree upon a document so that we have an answer to give to the Council that is sitting and waiting and will listen to what we are to say today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Thomas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, there are too many states in the European Union in which the economy is stagnating, and many areas in which reforms have not been implemented. The coming year’s enlargement from fifteen to an expected twenty-five Member States presents us with an additional challenge. The Lisbon strategy is an ambitious one, and its implementation must take account of these realities. It follows that we need to set other priorities for the European employment policy guidelines. As Commissioner Vitorino has already mentioned, this is about increasing the employment rate. It is also about increasing the value of products and raising the level of productivity. It is about reforms to the various systems of taxation and social security benefits – which, Mr Schmid, are in fact matters for the Member States – where a balance is to be maintained between flexibility and security. It is about activating those who are willing to work and capable of work, and about better involvement of the local and regional stakeholders. Finally, it is about mounting a more determined attack upon the black economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmid was prepared to take on board many of my group’s amendments. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I thank you for your good cooperation. Our proposals are reflected in what are now sixteen workable compromises, including on the use of educational and training methods to create workplaces of high quality, on increasing the level of investment in enterprises, on strategies for lifelong learning in accordance with the requirements and abilities of those involved, on the abolition of subsidies to industries which have no viable future, and on job creation in regions with a high level of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, a number of our core points are absent from the areas of the setting up of new enterprises, monetary policy and taxation. Firstly, one of the essential aspects of the European Employment Strategy’s approach is the practical support for the setting up of enterprises, which goes beyond simplified administrative procedures and involves the extension of information networks for those starting new businesses. If these – and as a result, new jobs – are to be created, there needs to be easier access to credit on favourable terms, so we need more dependable equity capital finance – an area where the European Union differs to a marked degree from the United States. If there is sufficient liquidity, then competitiveness is ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we cannot accept the renewed attempt at marginalising the Stability Pact, on which, in the eurozone, the confidence of economic decision-makers and consumers depends. It cannot be put to one side, even if, in certain Member States, ministers make so bold as to negotiate exemptions for their portfolios. The logical consequence of undermining the Stability Pact, which is so important, would be the loss of public confidence and the weakening of the euro, which is, thank God, a strong currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there must be incentives in law to make employment more attractive to workers and employers. This should involve reducing the tax burden on work to such an extent that the creation of new jobs ends up being less costly, which will make it possible to combat more effectively the black economy, which is booming. Overall, we should be working towards reducing the tax burdens in the Member States – for it is at that level that they are imposed – to such an extent that the public can again afford more and enterprises can at last get back to being more entrepreneurial. I very much hope that these amendments from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which we again discussed last night, will be approved by the plenary at noon today. Only then, Mr Schmid, will I be able to recommend to my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that they should endorse this report – only then!</p>

Employment policy is important on the whole. We now have a new framework to operate within, concerned with tighter coordination with the economic guidelines, more long-term thinking and more concentration upon the result of implementation in the Member States. We fully agree with this strategy. I wish to emphasise how important it is for the employment strategy to be put on the same footing as the economic guidelines so that they carry the same weight in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say something about the overarching objectives. We have abandoned the pillar structure. The fact that we now have full employment as an objective is particularly important. It is also important, as Mr Herman Schmid says, to supplement the employment objective with an objective relating to unemployment. Even if these are two aspects that run approximately in tandem, they do not do so one hundred per cent. It may be the case that employment is increasing but that there still remains a high degree of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another objective is work of good quality. In the future, Europe will not compete through cheap labour but through the quality of the products and services we are able to produce. For this, we need a properly educated labour force. Educating the labour force to make Europe competitive is clearly linked to lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">A third important issue is integration. It is not only a question of integration between regions, leading to a high level of employment – or full employment – throughout Europe, but also of there at present being groups that are, to a large extent, outside the labour market, for example people with disabilities and people from other countries. That is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The equality aspects have already been talked about, and it is important that we highlight them. They had a pillar of their own in the previous strategy. It is also important that the national parliaments be involved and that it be possible to supplement the overarching common objectives by national objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me briefly to say something about the disagreement. We need to resolve this in the committee. We have slightly different views of flexibility and security, but we shall succeed in agreeing on this point and saying that we need a balance.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the tax issue, I do not share Mr Mann’s view. You only have to look around in the European Union. Some of those countries that have the lowest unemployment and the highest levels of people in work do in actual fact also have the heaviest tax burden. This suggests to me that the tax issue is somewhat more complicated than appears from Mr Mann’s amendment. The level of employment is determined by a large number of factors. It is an over-simplification to say that, generally speaking, a reduction in tax is also good for employment. The fact is, it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, however, to say that I shall vote in such a way that we preserve unity in this House. What would be worst of all is if we in Parliament were not to express our view, now that we have an opportunity to do so. I shall be guided by that consideration in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report has our broad support.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, we have some concerns. First, we feel that too much detail may have crept both into the main report and certain amendments before plenary. Second, we wonder about some of the provisions on childcare and the reconciliation of work and family life. Are they fully compatible with sound public finance? In specifying the public sector, do they not ignore other means of delivering the same objectives as, for example, through the social partners?</p>
<p class="contents">On plenary amendments, we think that Amendment Nos 65 and 66 may send the wrong messages, respectively by implying a reduction in wages and by suggesting a one-size-fits-all approach. We prefer our own Amendment No 58.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, we applaud the references to people with disabilities and hope that a proposal for a horizontal directive will soon be forthcoming. We endorse the objective of gender equality and recognise particularly the need for special support for women returning to work.</p>
<p class="contents">I add my own particular concern about the continuing gender pay gap and call for a concerted effort to close it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we fully agree with the need for all stakeholders to be involved, including the parliaments within the Member States. Some are, and we welcome the initiative of others, such as the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament, to become so. But this should simply be the norm. The drive for more and better jobs is something in which we should all be directly engaged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, a debate distanced from the economic guidelines is meaningless, as is unfortunately the case with the debate now taking place, despite all the rapporteur’s efforts to the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s spring forecast predicts that GDP growth in 2003 will not rise above 1% in the Euro area. This will have negative effects on employment, which will fall by 0.1%, causing a rise in unemployment, which will reach an average of 8.8%. This situation should alert us to the need to change the Community’s monetarist policies, and in particular to review the Stability Pact, in order to give the highest priority to public investment and other means of promoting employment and social inclusion. The only problem is that, instead of this, the same old solutions are being put forward yet again. This makes it difficult to draw up credible employment strategies and targets for social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, although I still entertain the gravest doubts over the feasibility of the targets and goals proposed in this report, given the well-known positions of the Council, the Commission and the governments of most of the Member States on the possibility of changing the economic guidelines or of any revision of the Stability Pact to prioritise growth in high-quality employment giving the right to social inclusion, I would underline the positive (though inadequate) proposals which aim to improve employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also emphasise the point that all Member States must define quantifiable national targets to be included in the first national employment plan that they draw up in accordance with the new guidelines; the need for these targets to be debated in national parliaments; and the need for them to contribute to achieving better results, in terms not only of creating employment, but also of reducing unemployment, of equal opportunities and social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation, however, demanded much more. We must check the rapid growth of unemployment stemming from fundamental public sector liberalisation and privatisation, from the restructuring and relocating of multinationals, from the increasing difficulties facing micro-, small and medium-sized businesses and the lack of support they receive, from insistence on the supremacy of monetarist policies as well as restrictive ones which limit public investment and hinder the growth of workers’, retired people’s and pensioners’ buying power, and finally from an insistence on raising the retirement age, which punishes workers and does not create more jobs for young people. The only problem is that neither the majority in this Parliament nor the Council accept such proposals. On the contrary, they insist for the most part on policies which worsen the current situation, as we saw in the last part-session during the debate on economic policy guidelines, and as is happening again here, whenever anyone tries to go a little further, as Herman Schmid, the rapporteur, has done. Of course, advocating improved working conditions is a positive step, but proposing an overall reduction in the incidence rate of accidents at work of only 15% (25% in high risk sectors) throughout the Member States by 2010 does not mean a great deal, especially for a country like Portugal, which has the highest rate of accidents at work in the European Union, with an average of one death every working day. Attaining these aims, however, requires not only political commitment but also substantial changes to economic and monetary policy, which we have unfortunately not achieved up to now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we regret the lack of proper coordination within this Parliament with the broad economic policy guidelines and hope that we can rectify that in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the general thrust of the report and the Commission's proposals about the coordination with other strategies of the European Union, for example social inclusion. However, there is still a great underestimation of the importance of the sustainability strategy within this overall package as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome, however, the increased emphasis on the role of women in the report, and indeed the Commission's response to that, but we regret its removal as an overarching goal. We also welcome the increasing emphasis on the work-life balance. However, men will not achieve that until women have truly equal treatment in the workplace, and that includes equal pay.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a degree of sympathy with some of the remarks made about the cost of employment in terms of the costs to employers. However, the level of wages is also important and we are well aware that in certain Member States and some of the accession countries even the national minimum wage is effectively a poverty wage. Employers need to be looking at that dimension and not just the costs of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the issue of coordination with other polices, another one which should be included is our trade policies. We are working for a trading system which effectively drives production costs down and which encourages companies to relocate in search of competitive advantage. Therefore, we also need to examine the goals of our trade policy and the way they work with our employment policy because we are not convinced they are travelling in the same direction at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the coordinated employment strategy might have been useful, if it had gone into more detail, spoken of more precise problems and compared countries – if it had been pointed out, for example, that the unemployment rate in the countries of the euro area is approaching 9%, while in ‘non-euro’ countries it is in the region of 5%. Are there really no conclusions to be drawn from this fact? Even within the euro area, the disparities are very great. Leaving Luxembourg, an exceptional case, to one side, we see Austria on 4.2% and Ireland on 4.5%, at one end of the scale, with France on 9.3% and Spain on 11.9% at the other end. Faced with such differences, can we really extrapolate universally applicable guidelines without regressing into abstraction and even artificiality? For my part, I would rather see more respect for the spirit of open coordination – of diversity, of the exchange of good practice – and talk in concrete terms of successful experiments, which should be passed on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The points about the better balance between flexibility and security and the importance of entrepreneurship are very important themes in this debate and I will refer to those in my concluding remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start by sharing a very short story about the UK, which also has relevance for this morning. In my previous life in the manufacturing business, I remember vividly a certain major retailer that was losing market share and was starting to fall out with its advertising agency in this regard. The advertising agency had a very simple message 'You are not spending enough money on advertising'; the message was fine, so they increased the amount of money spent on advertising. The company continued to lose market share and the advertising agency said: 'you are still not spending enough money'. Finally the company saw the light and fired the advertising agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The moral of that story is that sometimes when you have a problem you do not need more and more of the same solution, you need very different solutions. That is a problem that we are facing within the EU and within Parliament at the moment. We have enough employment guidelines, the Commission's report was mildly helpful but the Member States already know exactly what they have to do. What they lack is the political will to do it. I do not believe it will help very much if we contribute to making those guidelines more detailed and more prescriptive. I agree with some of the comments of the rapporteur, and I very genuinely commend him for the hard work that he has put in, the thought that he has put in, and indeed the short timeframe in which he has done it. I agree particularly on the points he makes about tax, that it is very much a national issue and long may that so remain. However, some of the more prescriptive conclusions that he comes to and certainly the idea that, and I quote, 'there should be more comprehensive involvement of social partners that represent neither the majority of employers nor employees', do not seem to me to be a helpful step, I see them rather as a retrograde step.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of flexibility, security and entrepreneurship, I note that the Commissioner is not here today because quite rightly she is at this other very important meeting, the Employment Council. I hope at that meeting, where amongst other issues they will be talking about the Atypical Workers Directive, the Commission will take the opportunity to show that it wants to promote a different message and not the same old messages that have been promoted in the past and that it too believes in entrepreneurship and flexibility and does not wish to remain mired in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is a very important day, and I look forward to that meeting going the way I hope it will. I am sorry to say to the rapporteur that much as I support some of the thinking behind what he is saying we cannot support his overall report today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commissioner for what he said and for the effort which the Commission has made to accept amendments from Parliament. I know the Council is doing the same and is standing by waiting for us to adopt our opinion today, so that it can go ahead and adopt the employment guideline package.</p>
<p class="contents">That presupposes, however, that we will adopt this report today. In that respect, I would like to make an appeal to the PPE-DE Group, because that group has a tendency to seek revenge for the rejection of the Thomas Mann report on the spring summit some two months ago. That group has made it known that certain amendments are regarded as key amendments and if they are rejected in the House today then that group will vote to reject the whole employment guideline package. That would be a tremendously damaging blow. We have already dislocated the streamlined coordinated process, involving the employment and economic policy guidelines. I hope we can get the whole exercise back on track and I hope that group will pull back from this brinkmanship.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments its members regard as key amendments are causing us some difficulties. For example, Amendment No 64 concerns the stability pact. They are placing considerable emphasis on that point. That is strange because not even Mr García-Margallo y Marfil from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs places such emphasis on this point in his report on the broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 66 calls for a reduction in the overall tax burden on individuals and companies. A number of Members have made reference to this amendment already.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fundamental ideological point and is causing some difficulty for a number of my members. The emphasis that the PPE-DE Group members are placing upon this suggests that they have a determination not to seek consensus and to look rather to create problems for the adoption of this package. This amendment on the overall reduction in the tax burden is incompatible with the one they have tabled on the stability pact and it also concerns an area of responsibility that is reserved for the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot believe that if that amendment were rejected the PPE-DE Group would reject the whole package but I am assured by Mr Mann that would be the case. I hope the group will pull back. Reluctantly I am urging my members to abstain on Amendment No 66 in the hope that it will get through – although I disagree with it. If I fail and they lose that amendment, I again would appeal to the PPE-DE Group to pull back and not reject this package. It is simply not worth it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, which is very important, is on Amendment No 23 on the social economy. Last month I mentioned in the debate on the Cooperative Statute that the social economy had disappeared from the employment guideline package. I hope we can bring it back in as a result of this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the demands for adaptability will not lessen over the next few years. Training has an important role to play in this process, and I should like today to call for employment policy also to be seen in the context of the initiatives launched jointly by the EU’s education ministers with a view to improving the quality of training schemes through their open coordination. This will be of great importance to our longer-term competitiveness. A report, summarising the situation, will of course be produced by the autumn and debated at the Spring Summit in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all agreed that the objective is full employment and that this objective cannot be achieved without a basically sound economy, healthy public finances, a promising investment climate and keen competitiveness – all key elements when the idea is to create jobs. There is nothing contradictory about this, as parts of this Parliament perhaps appear to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Council has done a good piece of work in simplifying the employment guidelines. There was a need for this. Many of the guidelines were cobbled together without a thought for what they really needed to contain, which simply means that, in the case of many of the guidelines, the whole process has become less comprehensible and more perfunctory. I should therefore like to have seen Parliament be more sparing with the welter of amendments, even though our rapporteur has made great efforts to boil matters down to something comprehensible. The more guidelines that are crammed into employment policy, the greater the risk of their being viewed as immaterial. We need to focus on the objective: more employment and more jobs in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that Commissioner Vitorino is here rather than Commissioner Diamantopoulou is due to the fact that Commissioner Diamantopoulou is attending a meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council. That is a good thing, too, as we are voting today, and it is very good to hear that the things which we have already decided in the Committee, and which we hope to have adopted today and here I back the appeal by Mr Hughes to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are being discussed there so that we can reach further decisions. I should like to call for a number of things. First of all, I think that the general mainstreaming we are calling for is very important, and that this could in fact be extended still further, because I think that the whole equality arm, as it appeared previously in the European Employment Strategy, should still be formulated as a kind of objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also call for the development of two action plans. The first is an action plan against unemployment. Everyone knows what the problem is: unemployment is on the increase, and the recession is growing rapidly and is also set to last a long time – and something must be done about this. There is no balance between the long-term strategy of increasing employment participation, for example, and the short-term strategy in a number of other spheres. The second action plan is an action plan for improving quality at work and increasing productivity. Modernisation of work organisation, in particular, is urgently required. By way of conclusion, I think that it is important that we take the local and regional approaches and the involvement of national parliaments very seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is easy to agree on the principle of significantly reducing unemployment by 2010: I would challenge anyone to find a single European citizen – whether right-wing, left-wing or centre – who would vote against that principle. It is easy to agree on the principle that policies should contribute to reducing poverty by 50% by 2010 – we could have said ‘eliminate’ poverty while we were about it. I feel it is too easy to reach agreement on objectives of this kind. The problem arises – and it is a problem which we are failing to address – when it comes to defining options, taking decisions or calling for specific decisions to be taken. It has already been observed that employment increases with the growth of the economy – as is shown by a number of recommendations which I fully endorse on the quality of employment, equal rights for men and women, jobs and so forth. Since the labour market and policies relating thereto can encourage economic and employment growth in Europe, we need to introduce flexibility and liberalisation into the employment and employment agencies sector wholesale.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the tax burden, we need to take into consideration the burden of contributions for pensions systems. Young workers – Germans, Italians and Europeans in general – are paying through unemployment for excessively large pensions to be provided for workers retiring too early. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lifelong learning, employment for the elderly and combating undeclared work are all priorities which must be emphasised, as the rapporteur, of course, rightly states. Although it outlines the importance of common priorities, this report approaches certain areas less successfully. These areas are:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Stability Pact: applying the employment strategy is the responsibility of the Member States, who should ensure that sufficient financial resources are made available, bearing in mind the need for sound public finances in accordance with the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability Pact. The Stability Pact is an essential instrument for guaranteeing good public finance management on the part of the Member States and for ensuring sustainable growth and the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. Reference to the Pact and compliance with its provisions is thus crucial to European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, immigration as a response to the overall job creation strategy should be strictly regulated. Recruitment of immigrant workers should be done selectively. Checks must be carried out to see if the conditions for entry, residence and employment prescribed by the relevant legislation have been fulfilled, in order to avoid uncontrolled immigration. Illegal immigration into the Member States is the object of extremely uneven national legislation and has been on the increase in recent years, bolstered by the traffic in human beings and the activities of facilitators. It should be left to the discretion of each Member State to define the type of qualifications needed, as well as the number of workers it intends to recruit, based on the needs of its labour market, its population trends and its ability to integrate immigrants. Furthermore, the battle against undeclared work should be joined with renewed vigour, reducing labour costs and making the creation of new jobs less burdensome.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the definition of targets such as, for example, reducing unemployment or increasing the participation of women in the labour market, should be challenging but realistic, and the different starting points of the various Member States should be taken into account. These aims should be thought of as progressive steps to take rather than as levels to attain. Otherwise, we run the risk of their becoming unacceptable and badly implemented in national employment plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino, who expressed very well the need for a balance between security and flexibility as essential factors for competitiveness and productivity in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the rapporteur, for I feel that he has endeavoured in a short space of time to take into account all the different viewpoints in the House, without compromising on quality objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on a number of considerations. If we take into account the economic climate and the experience we have gained in recent years on the European employment strategy, it would appear that the Commission has already endeavoured in its proposals to define specific objectives which I consider to be particularly important because they are in line with the recommendations made by the Commission on the basis of the evaluation of national employment plans. I therefore believe that this strategy is becoming increasingly specific. If the Community institutions are to foster this tendency towards specific measures, we need firmer support from many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to focus on a number of points. The Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have defined precisely a number of aspects of the Commission’s communication, such as the need to invest in quality and services to make female employment a reality. In all the countries, some of them in particular, this aspect of the employment situation is distressing, in that there is both a high inactivity rate and a high unemployment rate. Matters can be improved by providing training for women and the services necessary to make the market favourable to female employment. The amendments adopted in committee are along these lines. Then we need a more effective partnership at Member State level involving governments, national Parliaments and local authorities in their respective roles. I feel these are tangible goals. This is a point on which we all agree but which is incompatible with cutting taxes across the board, for we cannot have it both ways: either we have investment resources or we reduce taxation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though I am very dubious about the value of EU guidelines, there is no point in discussing the whys and wherefores of them right now. I shall therefore concentrate on the Commission’s proposed guidelines and, above all, comment on Mr Herman Schmid’s report, as it appears following the vote in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much that is good in the Commission’s proposal, although even <span class="italic">that</span> is too detailed. The debate in committee has led to further detailed requirements and measures having been added. If guidelines are to be of any value, they must be firmly established in the relevant Member State. It does not make sense to cite, as now in this proposal, an ever-increasing quantity of measures and detailed objectives. At present, it is a question of 15 Member States; tomorrow, of 25. Offering at least 33% of children under three years of age childcare is, in my view, an issue that EU guidelines should have no bearing upon whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the general defect of being too detailed, the report before us has the fault of containing points that I very much doubt could do any thing at all to help increase employment. The rapporteur writes that responsibility for implementing a successful employment policy lies with the Member States. That is quite true for, as long as the governments of the Member States are not themselves prepared to take the necessary measures to reform the labour market, employment will not significantly increase. I am thinking mainly of reforms aimed at making it easier to employ staff, but also at reducing staff numbers. It is unfortunately the case that, for a small company to venture to employ one further person, its managers must know that, if it were to become necessary, they could reduce the number of staff. Germany is an example of what happens if a rigid labour market is not reformed. Unemployment has increased very considerably, partly because of rigid labour law. The fact is, too, that the longer the delay in reforming the labour markets, the more difficult the situation becomes.</p>
<p class="contents">It perhaps seems odd that, as a Swedish Moderate in this Chamber, I am going to refer to something said recently by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, but what he said is worth quoting. He said that structural reforms are needed if the European economy is to be given new impetus, that more trade liberalisation is required and, above all, a liberalisation of labour markets by means of fewer regulations and healthier levels of labour protection. There are at present 13 million people within the EU who do not have any work to go to. Chancellor Gordon Brown thought that flexibility was not a threat to full employment but the prerequisite for increased employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines should therefore be more overarching and concentrate on measures that, together with the economic policy guidelines, genuinely lead to economic growth and consequently to more people employed and thus to the provision of resources for things like education and health care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the short deadline, he has made a very reasonable and consensus-based approach towards getting an opinion from this Parliament that can be presented to the Council meeting. Of course, we have a right to be consulted under the Treaty obligations and we should always utilise such opportunities to put forward the ideas that we as representatives of the citizens of the European Union wish to see promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have difficulty with some aspects of the report, in particular regarding the introduction of issues related to the Stability and Growth Pact. I do not believe that we need to expand further on what the Commission has already said on this matter. Ultimately our role and our aim should be to try and create more and better jobs for people and to ensure that the guidelines as laid down are more focused; that they are flexible in the sense that they can respond to new opportunities which arise; and that they are based on competitiveness to ensure that companies are encouraged to take on more people and not to move their production abroad or outside of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key areas with regard to creating more jobs, if you look at the empirical evidence, has been sound public finances with a proper tax regime, to ensure that people are rewarded more for their work and entitled to keep more of their money in their pockets, rather than being penalised for working. This does not just apply to workers, it also applies to companies that employ those workers. We have to ensure that the social partnership model, which has been so successful in creating industrial harmony, is maintained and strengthened. We must also in this year, the European Year of Disabilities, take account of people with disabilities, some 70% of whom are unemployed. New innovative measures and research must be promoted to integrate people with disabilities into the labour market.</p>

In our view, there is a need to put forward ambitious objectives and pragmatic specific measures, with new and innovative approaches and more local and regional initiatives – all of which you have included in your report. For a long time, we have been passing resolutions demanding that the national parliaments be more involved – not only Denmark’s and Scotland’s, but those right across the European Union. However, the fact that the European Employment Policy allows national objectives and decision-making leeway is another indicator of how astute it is. What I would like to tell the honourable lady Member from Sweden is that the German labour market might well be in need of reform, but there is not one Member State of the European Union in which the removal of protection against dismissal has helped to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say, though, that there are two points on which we are critical of the Christian Democrats. One, which has already been referred to, is Amendment No 62. The Commission has proposed the use of immigration policy to govern the way in which the potential labour becoming available through immigration is used. I think there is a need for the Christian Democrats to face up to this fact and for this not to be taken, as it were, <span class="italic">ad absurdum</span> by means of special bilateral arrangements between the Member States, with conservatives remaining silent in the face of this practice. We cannot support tax cuts across the board, and I find it regrettable that this amendment is being treated as the most important. Europe’s entrepreneurs expect something different: their expectations are for the security that makes it possible to plan for the long term, for qualified workers, the best possible infrastructure, promotion of science and research, the weeding-out of rules and regulations, and investment. There is a need for such measures, and they cannot be brought about by tax cuts across the board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this light, the adoption of the rapporteur's report by a broad majority in Plenary is not just the only way forward, but is also an obligation towards the European citizens whose interests we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative taken by the Commission appears to confirm the priority of quality competition, which is bound up with the quality of employment and the quality of public services. The policy of promoting not just cheap labour but cheaper and cheaper labour, which the amendments by the PPE-DE will bring about, is a non starter because, while it brings about a gradual reduction in the standard of living, it also facilitates the survival of companies with low productivity and little growth capacity, as the rapporteur also rightly underlines. So instead of insisting on the link with the stability pact, which restricts initiatives for interventions in the labour market and measures to modernise public services, without which they will be handed over to the private sector on a plate, we should be calling consistently for other guidelines. Thus, we should be calling for maximum coordination with the European Charter for Small Enterprises, which places emphasis on promoting enterprises based on knowledge and innovation, and urging a rapprochement between industrial policy and the demands of the European social model. Industrial policy to date, instead of following this direction, marginalises employment-related matters.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a pity if the PPE-DE stood by its initial choices which, instead of resulting in the exploitation of the competitiveness of quality, which is the advantage of the European economy, insist on more and more exploitation of cheap labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to congratulate the Commission, which is placing particular emphasis on very close, more active participation by the national parliaments and on the mobilisation of local societies, with corresponding, specific commitments to increase employment, an idea which I too have supported in the past. In this way, we shall achieve not only a broadening of responsibilities on employment issues, but also the development of healthy competition between the individual regions of a country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank him for his effort to find common ground, even though we might not all agree on everything.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon European Council set a strategic objective for the European Union. The Union was to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the market. It was to be capable of sustainable economic growth and of generating more and better jobs. Social cohesion was to increase. The European Union’s commitment to jobs was consolidated and strengthened at the European Councils of Stockholm and Barcelona held in 2001 and 2002 respectively. I therefore believe that at a time when the European economy is stagnant and enlargement imminent, it is right to reiterate the ambitions stated at Lisbon and Barcelona. These ambitions should be adjusted to suit the current economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the right of each and every citizen of the European Union to work is enshrined in Article 15 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Economic activity, jobs and favourable conditions for development cannot be isolated and dealt with as a self-contained area. I would therefore like to focus on some cross cutting ideas. I am aware of the time restrictions and only intend to offer a few suggestions, given that Mrs Regina Bastos has already emphasised the need to abide by the Stability Pact, to continue combating illegal immigration and to ensure the integration of legal immigrants when appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have in mind specific ideas, such as the commitment to more and better jobs. These should be jobs in which flexibility and stability need not threaten workers’ rights. There is also the idea of making social policies such as those on accidents in the workplace horizontal. I refer to developing a culture of prevention, and to combating such accidents. After all, this report does contain specific commitments on reducing the number of accidents in the workplace. Then there are the policies on equal opportunities. It is important to go beyond issues relating to earnings and women’s access to the labour market. As I see it, it is also essential to ensure that the demands of the workplace can be reconciled with those of family life. National parliaments, regional assemblies, national and local authorities all have a part to play in this. They are in a good position to identify needs. As Commissioner Vitorino stated, they are also well placed to help explore new employment opportunities with all the parties involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall briefly summarise their views too, insofar as I am able.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of the European ruling class, and the European Parliament in particular, is to rewrite the model of the social market economy, to modernise it, to revise it without reducing the social undertaking. Job security must no longer be sought on the basis of acquired rights but through skills, hard work and lifelong learning. Wage differentiation, which has consistently been advocated in theory but has often been disregarded in practice, must become a genuine goal for Parliament, which must specify clearly and resolutely the process to be followed to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">This commitment to reform must be upheld first and foremost by the active parties, in other words by all the social elements who will have to make responsible commitments to promoting training, innovation and flexibility, without, however, subsequently going back on them when the time comes to implement them. The dialogue on the bargaining structure<span class="bold"> </span>will have to reinforce both the company level and wage differentiation; where the company level is reinforced, productivity is enhanced and individual contributions are appraised. Clearly, in order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to match bargaining at national level with bargaining at company level. In order to provide secure jobs, we need, however, above all, as has already been said, to boost investment, the real spearhead, especially in future initiatives targeting the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Joint ventures are another way of boosting SMEs, which, we must not forget, provide over 90% of jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">When applying flexibility, care must be taken to ensure that it does not become an easy option for certain companies which would like to exploit this solution by creating atypical jobs such as collaboration contracts, which do not represent a secure future, especially for young people. If we abuse this instrument, we will be in danger of creating future generations of precarious, insecure workers, but also, above all, of creating low-income future pensioners, in other words poor future pensioners. We must therefore avoid giving way to populism in these major reforms and endeavour to take resolute, practical, achievable steps forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the benefit of Commissioner Vitorino, I wish to mention a couple of amendments that we Christian Democrats, including myself, have been involved in wording. It is a question of the demographic challenge which, in Stockholm in March 2001, was identified as one of the Union’s most important issues for the future. It is estimated that, by 2050, the European Union will have 40 million more pensioners than at present and, thus, 40 million fewer people of working age. This is stated in Amendment No 1, as an important part of Mr Herman Schmid’s report. I want to ask Mr Vitorino how he regards the crisis in the pensions system in relation to economic development and the survival of whole districts within the European Union against the background of the serious demographic trend.</p>
<p class="contents">It is encouraging that a number of amendments, including Amendments Nos 28 and 38 concerned with the reconciliation of family and professional life, are now part of Mr Herman Schmid’s report. This is an incredibly important issue, but it is not good that Amendment No 43 states that work and family life will be reconciled notably through commitments to develop childcare services. It should be more a question of children having the right to more time with their parents than of our necessarily having to develop a form of childcare that gives children less time with their parents.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 is also important. It is about the need to strengthen the taxpaying ethic, about competition on equal terms between companies and about stepping up the fight against undeclared working.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me in conclusion to put in a good word for Amendment No 60, which emphasises the value of families, family enterprises and the transition from one generation to the next. If we are to do anything towards creating long-term jobs, the issue of how such transitions are carried out needs to be resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
