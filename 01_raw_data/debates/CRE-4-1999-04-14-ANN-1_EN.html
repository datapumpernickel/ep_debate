<p class="contents">Question No 19 by <span class="bold">Brian Crowley </span>(H−0259/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Computers and the year 2000</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the continuing concerns relating to the computer bug in the year 2000, will the Council urge each Member State to insist that all operators of major utilities, hospitals, airports, banks, social security systems, traffic control networks and police authorities immediately report to them any serious problems encountered relating to their computer systems so that the situation can be assessed and all relevant information exchanged and coordinated at a European level through the offices of the European Commission in order to counteract potential disasters?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">1. The Council is well aware of the problems arising from the fact that many computer systems and programmes will not be able to cope with the change of date at the millennium. The Council is also aware of the impact this will have on certain sensitive infrastructures and sectors such as major utilities, hospitals, airports, banks, social security systems, traffic control networks and police authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">2. I should like to remind the honourable Member that the Council has stressed the importance of this matter on a number of occasions: for example, the European Councils of Luxembourg, Cardiff and Vienna. The Council has also urged the Member States and all persons concerned to take action with a view to minimising any adverse effects of the millennium problem on the safety of European citizens and on the functioning of essential public services.</p>
<p class="contents">3. With regard to further consideration of this problem, the Council welcomes the Commission's intention to organise a meeting with representatives of public infrastructure facilities from the Member States in order to ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the cross‐border aspects in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">4. The Telecommunications Council will be adopting a resolution on 22 April 1999 dealing in particular with the importance of the continuing viability of critical cross‐border infrastructure. The resolution also considers the need for emergency planning to ensure the continuity of essential services in the event of a major crash.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 20 by <span class="bold">Eva Kjer Hansen </span>(H−0261/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Appointment of officials without holding a competition</p>
<p class="contents">It appears from ‘Agence Europe' of 5 March 1999 that the Council intends to appoint a group of employees from the ‘Schengen secretariat' without requiring them to pass either a competition or a probationary period, which would appear to conflict with the Staff Regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of an alternative appointment procedure based on Article 24 of the 1967 Merger Treaty would mean that the Council, on specific conditions and on the basis of a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, could appoint outside staff as officials without competition, but the Council presumably did not consider using this procedure here.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council explain why it in this case considers it legitimate both to flout the current Staff Regulations and to ignore the Commission's right of initiative laid down in Article 24 of the Merger Treaty?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 21 by <span class="bold">Mihail Papayannakis </span>(H−0268/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Incorporation of Schengen staff into the General Secretariat of the Council</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to incorporating the Schengen secretariat, the Council has opted for an ad hoc decision to recruit Schengen staff en bloc as officials of the General Secretariat of the Council, without following Staff Regulation procedures, in particular with regard to recruitment. According to the opinion of the Council's legal service (6 March 1998), this option is very questionable from a legal point of view in that it is not consistent with the Treaties and is contrary to the Staff Regulations. The Council is incorporating the Schengen staff despite the fact that the Secretary‐General and the Council's Staff Committee had already agreed in 1997 that Schengen staff would be incorporated on the basis of competition in line with the provisions of the Staff Regulations in this respect. The Council would seem determined, therefore, to act contrary to the Staff Regulations and the principle of the independence of the European civil service. Moreover, this decision has had serious adverse consequences within the Council. Does the Council not consider that this approach, which is not in keeping with the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations, threatens to compromise its relations with its staff and tarnish its public image at a time when the European institutions are already being criticised over their transparency and respect for the law?</p>
<p class="contents">Joint answer</p>
<p class="contents">With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam on 1 May 1999 the Schengen Protocol will also be applied. On the basis of Article 7 of this Protocol the Council is obliged by virtue of primary legislation to take responsibility for the recruitment of the Schengen staff. To this end the Council is authorised to adopt the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Council"s view the examination of the professional qualifications of the Schengen staff who are to be recruited and the trial period provided for will be sufficient to guarantee that the principles of a legally correct and transparent recruitment procedure are adhered to in the context of this special procedure for which provision is made in the Treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 22 by <span class="bold">Karl Habsburg‐Lothringen </span>(H−0267/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Eurostat abbreviation for Macedonia</p>
<p class="contents">In Commission Regulation (EC) 2645/98<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> , which covers the nomenclature of countries and territories for external trade statistics and the transition from a numerical to an alphabetical code, the Republic of Macedonia is given the code ‘XM' instead of the code ‘MK' originally assigned to it. The letter ‘X' is normally used exclusively for territories and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">What action has the Council taken, or does it intend to take, to avoid this discriminatory behaviour towards a sovereign and independent state such as the Republic of Macedonia?</p>
<p class="contents">When can the Council be expected to ensure that the Commission corrects Regulation (EC) 2645/98 accordingly, not least to avoid a European country like Macedonia suffering unnecessary economic damage in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of this problem, which has been referred to the competent Council group and the relevant working groups of the European Commission. The Commission has been asked to find a solution as quickly as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 23 by <span class="bold">Marianne Eriksson </span>(H−0272/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Structural Fund support for the Lear Corporation</p>
<p class="contents">An American company, the Lear Corporation, has decided to transfer production from Bengtsfors in Sweden to other locations, including Portugal. Its investment in Portugal is worth SKr 100 m. According to TV 4, Sweden's biggest TV channel, three quarters of this is coming from the EU's Structural Funds and one quarter from the Portuguese government. The Lear Corporation has also used EU Structural Funds to finance its operations in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council take the view that American or other companies should be able to use EU Structural Funds to play two Member States off against each other? What restrictions and controls does it intend proposing with regard to the payment of subsidies now that the Structural Funds are to be reformed and renegotiated?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 24 by <span class="bold">Inger Schörling </span>(H−0273/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU grant for relocation of company within EU assisted regions</p>
<p class="contents">The American Lear Corporation has produced a plan which entails the closure of its plant at Bengtsfors in Dalsland, Sweden. The town will lose 860 jobs at a swoop. The company's car‐seat production will be transferred to a plant which it is planning to build in Portugal. By relocating to Portugal, the company will receive an EU grant of SEK 75 million and a tax concession from the Portuguese government to the same amount. In addition, the Lear Corporation previously received an EU grant to maintain production at Bengtsfors and is now to receive a grant to move it away. Is it reasonable for EU funds to be used to move production from one assisted region to another? Surely only new production set‐ups should qualify for grants under EU subsidy rules? If this is not the case, should such a rule not be introduced? Does the Council accept tax competition of this kind despite the fact that tax competition is contrary to the code of conduct on corporate taxation adopted in 1997? Does the Council intend to investigate more closely the circumstances under which the Lear Corporation obtained the grant to transfer its production to Portugal? Are there, or have there been plans to produce statistics on the frequency with which EU grants result in companies moving their production from place to place within the EU without creating any more jobs?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 25 by <span class="bold">Jan Andersson </span>(H−0285/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Action to prevent Structural Fund grants from contributing to job losses</p>
<p class="contents">Lear, the motor vehicle components company, has transferred operations from Bengtsfors in Sweden to Palema in Portugal as a direct result of receiving EU aid. As Lear is a major employer in Bengtsfors, the closure will have very serious consequences for the whole district. All over Sweden, people are quite rightly up in arms about EU resources being used to shed jobs. The EU's inability to do more to ensure that structural aid and regional development grants do not distort competition is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council say what steps are being taken to stop Structural Fund grants causing distortions of competition resulting in job losses, as has happened at Bengtsfors?</p>
<p class="contents">Joint answer</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give a joint answer to the questions raised by Mrs Eriksson, Mrs Schörling and Mr Andersson as they all refer to the same case involving European Structural Funds. I would emphasise that the Council has no knowledge of the facts involved in this case and has therefore never discussed them.</p>
<p class="contents">All I would say is that implementation of Structural Fund aid is not the responsibility of the Council but of the Commission, and it is therefore to the Commission that you should address your questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would refer in this context to Articles 169 and 170 of the Treaty, which state that the Commission ensures that the Member States fulfil their obligations under the Treaty and point to the possibility of recourse to legal action should this fail to be done. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 26 by <span class="bold">Gerard Collins </span>(H−0277/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Protection for pedestrians in car design</p>
<p class="contents">In each of the past five years the results of crash tests have shown that car manufacturers are not taking sufficient steps to incorporate design features which would improve pedestrian protection in collisions with cars. Legislation to force manufacturers to make the necessary modifications is supposedly in the pipeline but has been repeatedly delayed. Given that around 8000 pedestrians are killed each year in Europe, with particularly high numbers in rural districts with poor roads, can the Presidency give an assurance that the rapid introduction of this vital legislation be given a high priority, and will the Presidency outline the timetable envisaged for the implementation process?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not received any Commission proposal for legislation compelling car manufacturers to incorporate design features which would improve pedestrian safety in the event of a collision between a car and a pedestrian. Without a Commission proposal the Council cannot even begin to give thought to a timetable for the adoption and implementation of such legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 27 by <span class="bold">Olivier Dupuis </span>(H−0278/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Tunisia: the case of Mr Khémaïs Ksila</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Khémaïs Ksila, vice‐chairman of the Tunisian League for the Protection of Human Rights, has been imprisoned for almost two years for his activities as a human rights militant. His situation is a cause for concern as he is a diabetic and has a heart condition. He was prosecuted on charges of ‘defamation against public policy and the public authorities', 'spreading false reports likely to cause a breach of the peace' and ‘incitement of citizens to break the law of the land' and sentenced, under scandalous circumstances, to 3 years' imprisonment and a heavy fine by the Tunis Criminal Court on 11 February 1998. This sentence was upheld on appeal on 25 April 1998 and his appeal on a point of law was hastily dismissed on 28 May 1998. In the unanimous opinion of his Tunisian lawyers and 9 international observers, Mr Khémaïs Ksila is the victim of a genuine miscarriage of justice made worse by the way in which the authorities have hounded him and his family. What steps has the Council taken since Mr Ksila's arrest to persuade the Tunisian authorities to release him, stop all forms of harassment of him and his family and as well as anyone militating for the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in Tunisia and for the observance of fundamental rights? Since any steps which may have been taken have been fruitless, what further steps does the Council intend to take to obtain the rapid release of Mr Ksila? Finally, does the Council not believe that in the light of such conduct on the part of the Tunisian State it would be advisable to review relations between the EU and Tunisia?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware of the circumstances of the Khémaïs Ksila case referred to by the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council places great political importance on the spread and observance of human rights in Tunisia and is therefore paying close attention to developments there.</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia was the first of the Mediterranean partners to conclude a EURO‐MED association agreement with the European Union, which established a direct political dialogue in which both sides can openly discuss political issues, including human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has, in various approaches, repeatedly raised the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms with Tunisia and it will continue to do so in future, including in relation to the Khémaïs Ksila case.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, human rights in Tunisia will be discussed in the course of the next meeting of the CFSP working group in May. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 28 by <span class="bold">Manuel Medina Ortega </span>(H−0279/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Fishing agreement with Argentina</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Council's policy with regard to the present fishing agreement with the Argentine Republic, the Argentine Government's failures to comply with it and the prospects for renegotiation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware of the problems that have arisen as a result of the Argentine Republic"s new fisheries regulation. To solve these problems a meeting of the EC‐Argentina Joint Committee was held in Buenos Aires on 4/5 March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Joint Committee meeting the Community called upon the Argentine Government to comply with all the provisions of the fishing agreement with the European Community. It urged in particular that the discriminatory elements of the fisheries regulation (zoning of the hake fishing area) be withdrawn. The Community also expressed its regret that the agreement is no longer a balanced one as a result of the discriminatory legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations on a new agreement are the responsibility of the Commission, which has already held exploratory talks with the Argentine Government on this issue. Following the conclusion of these exploratory talks the Council will establish an appropriate mandate for new negotiations in due course. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 29 by <span class="bold">John McCartin </span>(H−0281/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Amnesty International claims concerning human rights in Egypt</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of Amnesty International claims regarding a worsening human rights situation in Egypt, particularly in respect of the numbers of deaths and the torture of prisoners in custody? Has the Council raised in any of its contacts with the Egyptian authorities the situation surrounding the death in 1996 of Karimi Nduthu, the Secretary‐General of the Release Political Prisoners Group, into which no inquest has yet been held?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware of the reports by Amnesty International on human rights in Egypt. The EU has repeatedly taken up human rights issues with the Egyptian Government and it will maintain its commitment in future. The EU has not yet had an opportunity of taking up with the Egyptian Government the particular case you mention.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights issues are also an important aspect of the negotiations currently under way on an association agreement between the EU and Egypt, since Egypt is not prepared to accept unreservedly the human rights clause required by the EU. The EU is therefore closely monitoring human rights in Egypt and is engaged in a dialogue with the Egyptian Government on these issues. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 30 by <span class="bold">Anna Karamanou </span>(H−0284/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Organisation of impartial investigations into the disappearance of 3000 people in Algeria</p>
<p class="contents">According to Amnesty International, the problem of disappearances in Algeria has been shown to have intensified following revelations of arbitrary arrests and illegal detention. More particularly, during the last six years, about 3000 men and women have disappeared and only very few of them have been traced following prolonged period of secret detention. The authorities and the security services are refusing to provide any information concerning the fate of detainees to their families, who are desperately searching not only hospitals and army camps but also mortuaries and graveyards for even the slightest clue as to their whereabouts. What steps will be Council take to launch a full, impartial and independent inquiry into all these disappearances and to ensure effective protection for human rights in Algeria?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation in Algeria has improved significantly in the last year. This is also clear from reports by independent human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The disappearances date mostly from the mid−1990s; recently there have been hardly any such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The Algerian Government is showing an obvious willingness to cooperate in this area and has now contacted the ICRC in order to deal with the subject of disappearances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Algerian foreign minister, Mr Attaf, has already agreed, during the EU‐Algeria consultations in October 1998 under the Austrian Presidency, to examine the cases raised by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This topic has been dealt with on several occasions in the CFSP working group responsible. The presidency last presented Algeria with documented individual cases for examination in March. The dialogue with the Algerian Government and independent human rights organisations will be continued by the Council, including the Heads of Missions in Algiers. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 31 by <span class="bold">Mark Killilea </span>(H−0290/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Monitoring of equal opportunities across the Structural Funds</p>
<p class="contents">The European Employment Strategy, adopted at the Luxembourg Summit, is committed to creating labour markets that provide equal opportunities and freedom from discrimination. Can the Council indicate what specific mechanisms will be put in place to ensure adequate implementation of such measures and how monitoring of Member States' activities in this respect can be carried out?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Employment Policy Guidelines adopted in 1998 following the European Council of Luxembourg contain equal opportunities as one of the four pillars of the new employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of experience of the first year of transposition of the directives, significant importance is attached to the equal opportunities aspect of the 1999 Employment Guidelines (OJ C 69, 12.3.1999, p. 2). Directive No 19 extends equal opportunities so that it also covers the other three pillars of the strategy (employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability).</p>
<p class="contents">The details of transposition of the Employment Policy Guidelines are left to the discretion of the Member States. They can present, in the National Action Plans to be submitted in June 1999, those measures with which they are endeavouring to achieve the objectives set out in the Guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure appropriate monitoring of transposition of the Guidelines, the introduction to the text of the 1999 Guidelines stresses the need for common indicators which must be drawn up at Community level and on the basis of comparable statistics. The Committee on Employment and the Labour Market, with the technical support of the Commission's services, is actively engaged in identifying such indicators. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 32 by <span class="bold">Alan Gillis </span>(H−0292/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Angola</p>
<p class="contents">Given that Angola has now slipped back into civil war and the actions of both sides in this conflict are having a disastrous effect on the people of Angola in areas controlled both by the Governing MPLA and UNITA, it is the ordinary people yet again who are paying the price. What steps can the Council take to bring pressure on the warring sides to come to the conciliation table and therefore bring this suffering to an end?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council fully shares the honourable Member's deep concern at the current situation in Angola. We have made known our position on Angola on numerous occasions and we have repeatedly called on both parties – the government and UNITA – to honour their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. We have repeatedly called on the government not to seek a military solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Resolution 1229 of 26 February 1999 on extending the mandate of MONUA, the UN observer mission, the UN's Security Council made it clear that UNITA bears the main responsibility for the present situation because of its failure to honour the Lusaka Protocol of 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lusaka Protocol remains the only legal framework for a peaceful negotiated solution to the conflict. The Council is of the opinion that the EU should continue the policy it has pursued hitherto of supporting the efforts at conciliation by leading politicians from the UN and from the region and of ensuring effective implementation of the UN sanctions in Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is all too aware that it is the ordinary people of Angola who have to pay the price of this conflict. The EU is making efforts, both via ECHO and bilaterally on the part of the Member States, to ease the suffering through humanitarian aid. However, the only possibility of a solution to the conflict lies in an end to the fighting and in UNITA pursuing the path of peaceful negotiations. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Reduction in European funding for Spain</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds that Spain will receive for the period 2000‐2006 was agreed at the Berlin Council. Compared with the upward trend of the period 1993‐1999, is it not the case that Spain's cohesion funding is decreasing? Is it not also the case that the amount agreed for the next round of funding is lower than the Commission's most pessimistic predictions and the worse‐case scenarios discussed in the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">At its special summit in Berlin on 24/25 March, the European Council decided that the Cohesion Fund, whose fundamental objectives continue to be valid, should also be available to Member States in the euro zone whose national level of prosperity is less than 90 % of EU GNP. In order to take account of the increase in prosperity of euro participants as a result of previous support measures, the total appropriations were adjusted accordingly. The award of EUR 18 billion agreed in Berlin is, in the Council"s view, clear proof of the high priority given to cohesion policy and solidarity in the European Union. It is also welcome news in this context that the issue of the indicative allocation of Cohesion Fund resources to recipient states has now been successfully resolved in the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 34 by <span class="bold">James Fitzsimons </span>(H−0295/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Fighting drugs</p>
<p class="contents">According to the EMCDDA 1998 Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union, the total figure for internal spending in 1997 on EU drug‐related actions was ECU 33.3 million.</p>
<p class="contents">What assurances can the Council give that, in the light of its decisions in Berlin on EU expenditure over the coming years, future expenditure on drug‐prevention programmes and actions will not be cut back but will, in fact, be stepped up on the basis of an increase in appropriations starting in the financial year 2000?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the honourable Member"s question, it should be pointed out that the Council attaches the highest importance to the fight against drugs whose harmful effects are undermining the social fabric of our democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not yet submitted its draft general budget for the year 2000, and so the Council is not really in a position to comment on the amount of appropriations earmarked for this important aspect of Community policies. However, the Council can assure the honourable Member that it will give this matter its full attention. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 35 by <span class="bold">Niall Andrews </span>(H−0297/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Involvement of all ‘stakeholders' in the development of EU‐supported Urban strategies and initiatives in cities such as Dublin</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has submitted to the Council and the European Parliament an important Communication on ‘Sustainable Urban Development in the European Union: a Framework for Action' in which it argues that all stakeholders, including citizens, should be involved in the formulation of integrated urban strategies for sustainable development. It also argues that EU policies need to be made more ‘urban sensitive'.</p>
<p class="contents">With 80 % of the EU population living in towns and cities, and with urban areas having to bear the brunt of economic, social and transport problems, will the Council give an assurance that the Urban Initiative, supported from the current Structural Funds, will be central to future policies aimed at developing successful urban strategies, a matter which is vital for a rapidly expanding city such as Dublin?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware of the specific problems of urban areas and it has always attached particular importance to strategies for successful town planning.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the talks on Agenda 2000, the European Council in Berlin also reached political agreement on reform of the EU's structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the European Council has adopted the Commission's proposal to reduce the number of Community initiatives to three: Interreg, EQUAL and Leader. The objectives of the Community initiatives which are to be discontinued – including URBAN – can be pursued under the new Objectives 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, urban problem areas (accounting for 2 % of the EU's population) will be eligible for particular support in the new Objective 2. These areas include those with a high population density which are suffering from above‐average unemployment, high levels of poverty, environmental damage and crime, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Subject to the legislative procedure with Parliament, it is the Council's view that the future structural aid period will assign high priority to urban development policy, and that it will therefore allay the honourable Member's concerns. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 36 by <span class="bold">Pat Gallagher </span>(H−0299/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Outcome of the Berlin Summit and the common fisheries policy</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the conclusions of the Berlin Summit, will the Council indicate the likely consequences for the common fisheries policy and the development of the fishing and fish‐processing industries in Ireland?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The general compromise reached at the Berlin Summit entails including the fisheries sector in Objective 1 support and horizontal support outside Objective 1 regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures outside the Objective 1 regions will be supported by the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) which has funds of EUR 1.1 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria for support are set out in Article 2 of the draft of the FIFG in conformity with the Commission proposal for an implementing regulation. This proposal is currently under discussion in the Fisheries Council which is expected to take a decision on 10 June, </p>
<p class="contents">Since the practical details of aid are set out in the implementing regulation, it is not possible at present to give a precise assessment of the impact on the development of fisheries and the fish‐processing industry in Ireland. The actual effects will also depend on what measures the Irish authorities focus on in the programming procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this opportunity of being able to refer to the great success of structural aid for Ireland and the fact that Ireland's per capita GDP is approaching the Community mean. The proposal provides for a general structural fund regulation with a six‐year transitional period for regions which will no longer be eligible for Objective 1 aid. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 37 by <span class="bold">Liam Hyland </span>(H−0301/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Development of the Irish and European food industry</p>
<p class="contents">The food industry plays a vital role in the Irish and other European economies. In the face of a highly competitive international market and the additional need to ensure top priority for food safety issues, will the Council state what new initiatives could be taken at EU level to benefit Irish and European food producers and enable them to strengthen their position on home and world markets?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Food safety is a matter to which the Council attaches considerable importance, particularly in relation to protection of the health of consumers but also in the light of the European food industry. All legislation concerning food is especially concerned with safety and quality. The European Council of Luxembourg gave expression to this in its statement on food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, the Commission's task to submit to the Council proposals for initiatives in this area. No such proposal is currently before the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement by the European Council of Luxembourg is contained in the presidency conclusions of 12 and 13 December 1997 (SN 400/97, p. 37). In the statement, the European Council stresses that ‘the production and supply of safe food must be one of the European Union's priorities' and that ‘a high level of health protection' must be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to BSE, the Commission submits a report of activities to the Council and the European Parliament twice a year. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 38 by <span class="bold">Karin Riis‐Jørgensen </span>(H−0305/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Risks connected with BSE</p>
<p class="contents">One of the conclusions of the BSE conference of 30 November and 1 December 1998 was that it is not possible to operate with a no‐risk concept in food safety. Can the Council state what scientific risks there are in connection with BSE, e.g. what is the risk level compared with that of other forms of risks in food?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, is it possible to provide copies of the reports covering the observations made during the visits by members of the SSC (scientific steering committee) to the meat producers' factories – the dates of the visits, the names of the SSC members and their conclusions from the visits?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Under the heading ‘Lessons to be learned from the BSE crisis", the second joint European Commission and European Parliament conference held on 30 November and 1 December 1998 made an interim assessment of work done so far to combat mad‐cow disease. Around 450 politicians and scientists, civil servants and industrialists, consumers and farmers spent two days discussing future strategies for food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also welcomes the fact that consumers and society in general can be informed about existing risks and that an open dialogue can be held on the subject. The Treaty of Amsterdam actually now enshrines the consumer"s right to information and provides a further boost to this policy of openness.</p>
<p class="contents">However, questions concerning the scientific evaluation of risks in food should really be addressed not to the Council but to the European Commission, which can also provide information on the composition of the Scientific Steering Committee and on the reports and conclusions produced by these experts. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 39 by <span class="bold">Gary Titley </span>(H−0308/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: POWs still missing following the Gulf War</p>
<p class="contents">Eight years after the end of the Gulf War, the fate of over 600 POWs (mainly Kuwaitis) remains unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the terms of UN Resolution 687, Iraq is obligated to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross and account for and release all POWs. In December 1998, however, Iraq stopped collaborating with the ICRC.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council now bring pressure to bear on Iraq to account fully for all POWs it took during the Gulf War and release immediately and unconditionally any POWs it still holds?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">It is barbaric that eight years after the end of the Gulf War there are still prisoners of war and civilian detainees and that no information is available on their fate.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an item which will remain on the agenda of the international community until it has been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of Security Council Resolution 687 (the cease‐fire resolution of 1991) is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the Security Council itself which acts on behalf of all the UN's member states. In return, the member states implement the measures mandated by the Security Council: in this case, the sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of POWs is one which is on the agenda of the Security Council. The third of the panels set up on 30 January has just published its report, which is largely devoted to this question. The report will be one of the bases for the Security Council's future stance towards Iraq. As stated above, the issue will remain on the agenda until it is resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the honourable Member will be aware of how difficult if is to exert pressure on the Iraqi leadership with any prospect of success – and if it is difficult for the Security Council it is even more so for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the Council respects the approach of the ICRC, which treats the fate of the POWs and – to use the ICRC's wording – 'persons whose whereabouts is not known' as a humanitarian and not a political problem, and which conducts its negotiations in the utmost confidentiality, and once again it calls on Iraq to resume cooperation within the Tripartite Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 42 by <span class="bold">Anneli Hulthén </span>(H−0315/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Azo food dyes and the internal market</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden we have hitherto had a ban on azo food dyes, which is now being lifted in the interests of the functioning of the internal market. These are a group of synthetic dyes which are used among other things to colour desserts, as well as sweets and ice‐cream, which of course appeal in particular to children.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the German Presidency consider that we can guarantee the safety of our citizens when we know that these substances may be allergenic, and can we in the European Union really accept our children being needlessly exposed to dangerous food dyes?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The lifting of the ban on azo food dyes in Sweden is based on a Commission decision that was published in Official Journal L 3 of 7 January 1999, page 13. It would therefore be up to the Commission to explain this decision to the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would merely like to point out that European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC on colours for use in foodstuffs – which also lays down conditions for the use of azo food dyes – is based on an opinion delivered by the Scientific Committee for Food assessing the safety of additives. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 43 by <span class="bold">Christine Oddy </span>(H−0316/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: European Company Statute</p>
<p class="contents">What progress is being made by the German Presidency in discussions on the European Company Statute?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">There is considerable agreement between the Member States on the substance of the draft regulation on the European Company Statute. The main stumbling‐block to its adoption is the lack of agreement on the directive on participation by workers in European companies, which as far as the Member States are concerned is a prerequisite for adoption of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a failure to reach agreement on the abovementioned directive at the Labour and Social Affairs Council of 2 December 1998, the presidency is currently endeavouring to find a solution through bilateral talks with a number of Member States. The next specialist Councils (for the directive, the Labour and Social Affairs Council on 25 May 1999; for the regulation, the Internal Market Council on 21 June 1999) will be looking at this question again.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assured the honourable Member that the presidency attaches the highest priority to a successful conclusion of the matter of the European company. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 44 by <span class="bold">Carlos Bru Purón </span>(H−0319/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Introduction of a European eco‐tax</p>
<p class="contents">The Federal Republic of Germany has decided to levy a tax on the use of hydrocarbons, varying from 0.2 DM per kw/h to between 0.06 and 0.32 DM per kw/hour, according to circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council not of the opinion that the time has now come to introduce this eco‐tax, or a similar one, throughout Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Germany did indeed introduce an environmental tax reform on 1 April 1999, and the products which are being taxed are diesel, petrol, domestic fuel oil, petroleum gas and electricity. The tax revenue is returned in full to the taxpayers by means of reductions of 0.8 % in pension insurance contributions. This has benefits for the environment and also promotes employment, thus representing a double dividend.</p>
<p class="contents">Other EU Member States such as Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands have been busy introducing eco‐taxes as part of environmental tax reforms for several years now, and other states such as Austria and Belgium have environmental components in their tax systems. Since the beginning of this year Italy has introduced the first of five phases of an environmental tax reform, and is the first southern state to do so. The United Kingdom has also announced its intention to introduce a tax on industrial energy consumption in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">So more and more Member States are introducing environmental tax reforms. For competition reasons energy‐intensive industries generally come under a special taxation scheme, but this could be reduced if all states introduced this type of energy taxation. So in order to help to harmonise the internal market the European Commission presented on 12 March 1997 a ‘Proposal for a Council Directive restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products". Consequently, EU‐wide minimum rates of taxation, which already exist today for mineral oil products, are also to be introduced for all other energy products and, like those for mineral oil products, are to be increased in two further phases.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions on this proposal have been underway since 1997. At the end of 1998 the European Council in Vienna asked the Council to continue to work on a Community framework for energy taxation. At the same time it pointed to the promises of the Luxembourg and Cardiff Councils to integrate the environment and sustainable development into all Community policies in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ecofin Council is currently discussing the Commission proposal of March 1997 to further harmonise the taxation of energy products. The German Presidency has focused on this issue and set itself the goal of achieving a basic consensus between all Member States on the need to harmonise energy products and on the structure of such harmonisation. This should open the way to practical negotiations on the details of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Any form of support from the other Member States and the European Parliament for the harmonisation of energy taxation is therefore very welcome, especially as a majority of states are in favour of it. The objective is now to convince the states which do not agree in principle of the need for and benefits of this proposal. </p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<p class="contents">Question No 45 by <span class="bold">Alexandros Alavanos </span>(H−0225/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Abolition of the ‘bonus‐malus' factor in compulsory motor vehicle insurance</p>
<p class="contents">It has been reported in the press that the option of transferring the deduction in car insurance premiums under the ‘bonus‐malus' system is to be abolished. In view of the fact that some 70 % of Greek policy‐holders who have a positive ‘bonus‐malus' balance are affected and that the proposed abolition of the transfer of the deduction as it applies today will undermine competition, given that consumers will be reluctant to take out an insurance policy with a different insurance company offering lower rates, since they would thereby lose the deduction in their insurance premium, will the Commission say whether such an arrangement is in keeping with the European Union's rules on competition?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The abolition of the ‘bonus‐malus' system in Greece, to which the honourable Member refers, could be beneficial for both insurers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the abolition of the former system in 1996, each insurer has been free to set his own premiums and develop his own customer policy. Greece abolished the ‘bonus‐malus' system when transposing Directive 92/49/EEC (the third directive on non‐life insurance) which provides for freedom of rates and the removal of prior checks on premiums and contracts by the supervisory authorities of the Member State of origin of the insurer. More specifically, the Greek authorities have eliminated the provision laying down a compulsory ‘bonus‐malus' system, on the grounds that such a system was a price‐related measure and therefore contravened the third directive on non‐life insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">As for consumers, although it is true that a uniform ‘bonus‐malus' system makes it easier to transfer from one insurer to another, the freedom to set premiums has other advantages for consumers: Greek insurers will be free to take account of the ‘bonus' accrued with another insurer under the old system and, indeed, to grant even larger deductions than those allowable within the narrow bounds of that system. Moreover, depending on the background of each new client, the new insurer may vary the premium on the basis of several criteria, unlike what happened before. The variation in the criteria taken into account and the individual assessment of the risk posed by each policy‐holder may lead to greater competition on the market and to a reduction in premiums, to the benefit of consumers seeking third‐party motor vehicle insurance on the Greek market. All insurers are free to make an offer, and their customers are free to make up their own minds.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Commission remains competent under Community law to handle any further questions in this sector. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 46 by <span class="bold">Paul Rübig </span>(H−0226/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Raising public procurement thresholds</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution of 9 February 1999 the European Parliament called for the threshold values for public service, supply and works contracts to be raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the Commission expect such action to ease the burden on companies tendering for public contracts, for example for SMEs and in respect of the paperwork required, or to remove existing barriers in the internal market?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Threshold values for the application of the public procurement measures have been agreed so as to cover procurement potentially tradeable across frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives are thus meant to align the procedures to be followed in each Member State whenever a contract is to be awarded with a value exceeding, the thresholds, whereas the general principles enshrined in the Treaty apply to all contracts irrespective of their value.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that the application of the Community directives<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> may sometimes result in a heavy administrative burden, particularly for SMEs. This message came out clearly from some citizens and some representative organisations, which were recently consulted. It is also correct that the inter‐market penetration of public procurement is not as high as it is in other economic sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to cooperate with Member States and interested parties to improve the situation. However, the Commission is of the opinion that the answer to a sometimes disproportionate administrative burden does not lie in eliminating common procedures, including the right to remedies, which are necessary to ensure clarity and competition in public procurement. Rather, the answer lies in making the procedures simpler, more understandable and less costly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Commission has started several actions as discussed in Parliament on the occasion of the adoption of the Tappin report on the Communication of the Commission on Public Procurement in the European Union on 9 February 1999: </p>
<p class="contents">1. Firstly, the Commission is preparing some amendments to the existing legislation in order to simplify it whenever possible and to introduce flexibility. Those amendments will be presented to the Parliament and the Council in the next few months.<br />2. Secondly, the Commission is issuing interpretative documents in order to clarify the existing rules, in particular those which are coming more and more into use: for example a draft communication on the rules applicable to concessions has been put out for consultation.<br />3. Thirdly, the Commission is taking measures to promote electronic procurement. For example, the SIMAP (Système d'Information pour les Marchés Publics) website, which is free of charge from 1 January 1999, is an initiative aiming at improving the quality of information for SMEs about procurement opportunities and ensuring that information is available to all potentially interested suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">Those measures should reduce administrative barriers for enterprises wishing to take part in tendering procedures, whether national or throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Commission will continue to follow closely this matter to ensure that the measures taken actually produce the expected results. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 47 by <span class="bold">Ana Palacio Vallelersundi </span>(H−0234/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Greek law on television advertisements targeted at minors</p>
<p class="contents">The proceedings commenced under Article 169 of the EC Treaty with regard to the Greek law banning the televising of advertisements for children's toys between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. have been under consideration for a number of years now, and the Commission has already forwarded a letter of formal notice, arguing that the measure in question is excessive. In view of this situation, can the Commission say what steps it has taken to bring the aforesaid proceedings to a conclusion, forward the studies, reports and other documents drawn up on this matter, and compare the approach in each of the Member States to the advertising of toys on television?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In order to clarify and facilitate its assessment of the proportionality of the Greek law, at the end of 1998 the Commission collected a number of recent studies on the subject of advertising and children, which examined from a scientific point of view the dangers to children of being exposed to televised advertising, mainly for toys. The Commission services have drawn up a document summarising the main results of this research. This document, which I will make available to the honourable Member, does not include any working conclusions because of the sometimes contradictory points of view expressed by the researchers. It nonetheless served as a basic consultation document for a group of experts on commercials which held a round table on the subject on 22 October 1998. During this interesting debate we saw once again the diversity of current opinions on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The results were broadly speaking as follows: Greece is the only Member State to almost totally prohibit television advertising for toys. Sweden prohibits all television advertising targeted at minors. More limited prohibitive measures are found in Ireland and in the Dutch‐speaking area of Belgium, where advertising is banned during and immediately before and after children"s television programmes. The other Member States have, on the whole, simply adopted the provisions contained in the ‘Television without Frontiers" directive<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> . The justifications put forward by the Member States who have introduced prohibitive measures are essentially that children are unable to comprehend the commercial purpose of advertising and to differentiate between a commercial and another programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the information gathered, the new Commission will have to decide what to do next. I firmly believe it is necessary to find a rapid solution to this dispute so as to ensure a balance between legitimate concerns for the protection of children and the constraints of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the course of this year, in line with its promises to Parliament and the Council, the Commission is to launch an extensive study on the general problem of the impact of television advertising and of tele‐shopping on minors, in the context of evaluating the implementation of the ‘Television without Frontiers" directive. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 48 by <span class="bold">Thomas Megahy </span>(H−0251/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Spanish Gibraltar frontier</p>
<p class="contents">Restrictions by Spanish border guards at the Spanish/Gibraltar frontier are now causing delays of up to five hours or more. This is causing considerable difficulty on both sides of the frontier. The tourist industry in Gibraltar is badly hurt as are the 3000 people from La Línea legally working in Gibraltar who are protesting to their own government that the border restrictions threaten their livelihood. What steps does the Commission propose to re‐establish right of free movement for EU citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been informed from various sources about the difficulties mentioned by the honourable MEP encountered by European citizens when crossing the border at Gibraltar. They concern the border checks applied both to persons and to their belongings (vehicles, luggage in particular), which would entail according to these sources from 3 to 5 hours waiting time.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as far as the free movement of persons<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> is concerned, since one of the two interested Member States is not a member of the Schengen Treaty, it is not possible to apply the Schengen system that has abolished all border controls. At a border, like the one at Gibraltar, controls are allowed within the frame of current Community legislation. Pursuant to such provisions, Member States must allow citizens of the Union to enter their territory simply on production of valid identity card or passport, subject only to the limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of principle the legality of national provisions is subject to the proportionality test. The Court of Justice attaches special importance to the principle that the action of public authorities, whether Community or national, and obligations imposed on citizens who exercise individual rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty, should be proportionate to the legal objectives sought by public authorities<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> . Any Community or national measures limiting the exercise of a fundamental right such as the right to move freely within the territory of the Member States shall therefore respect the proportionality principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, the Commission is in contact with the Spanish authorities, in order to assure that the measures applied are compatible with Community law. The Commission will keep the honourable MEP informed on the follow‐up. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 49 by <span class="bold">Helena Torres Marques </span>(H−0275/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Disappointment of citizens in the euro zone regarding private use of the euro</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the countries of the euro zone have had a single currency since 1 January 1999, citizens of the zone wishing to use the euro are obliged to pay charges as though they were conducting transactions in more than one currency.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information provided by experts on the banking system, these charges may continue even beyond 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The great advantage of the single currency rests on the significant savings which it was expected to offer in cross‐border payments and above all in certain sectors such as tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to rectify this situation, there will need to be an inter‐bank payment system at internal‐ market level so that the euro zone can operate in the same way as the inter‐bank system in individual countries. Only then will the public see any advantage in using the euro rather than national currencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say when such a European system for payments in euros is to be set up and when the euro will be used and payments made in euros without entailing costs for citizens within the euro zone, thus bringing into being a genuine European internal market?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The question from the honourable Member concerns both the exchange of euro area national banknotes and cross‐border payments in euro in small amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the exchange of euro area national banknotes, the Commission is monitoring the situation closely. To this end, the Commission has asked the European banking associations to supply information about the past and present level of exchange fees. On 16 February, the Commission also announced an inquiry into whether banks have acted in breach of the competition rules in the Treaty, when setting their new exchange fees. It should be noted that the problem of fees for the exchange of euro area national banknotes is a transitional problem, which will be solved when euro banknotes are issued in 2002. Under Article 2, section (b) of Commission Recommendation 98/286/EC of 23.04.1998, the Commission expects banks to exchange household amounts of their national banknotes and coin into euro banknotes and coin, at least for their own customers, free of charge. The European banking associations have stated that their members will comply with the Commission Recommendation. It should also be noted that, during the transitional period, national central banks in the euro area are willing, subject to certain conditions, to exchange other euro area national banknotes into their own national banknotes free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards cross‐border euro payments in small amounts, the Commission has also asked the European banking associations to supply information about the past and present level of charges. The most important case relates to cross‐border transfers, where the cost of conversion for the banks represents only a small proportion of their total costs. Their other costs relate to working time, systems costs, telecommunications costs etc. As the honourable Member says, these other costs will not disappear, even in 2002. However, these costs could be reduced if the links between cross‐border retail payment systems were more efficient than they are at present. Some of the necessary elements for improving these links (e.g. the definition of the new ‘International Bank Account Number') are already in place. But more needs to be done to enable charges for small‐value cross‐border charges to be reduced towards the level of domestic charges.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission has announced in the Framework for Action that it intends to map out a common strategy for mobilising the efforts of the public and private sector in order to achieve the goal of a Single Payments Area for retail payments. The Commission will come forward with this Communication as soon as circumstances allow. The Communication will examine the existing barriers to small‐value cross‐border payments and propose concrete measures in order to reduce them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees that it is not acceptable in the single currency area for charges on small‐value cross‐border transfers to exceed charges on domestic transfers by several orders of magnitude. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Operation of the Commission's common external service (CES)</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the reform of the Commission services, whereby the responsibilities of DG IB and DG VIII for development cooperation with non‐governmental organisations are being brought together within a common external service (CES), many applications for project co‐financing and approval are being held up.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say how many projects are being processed at present within the said service and the dates on which those still awaiting processing were submitted?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 51 by <span class="bold">Josep Pons Grau </span>(H−0232/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Common external service</p>
<p class="contents">A number of European non‐governmental organisations have encountered problems in the processing of projects they have submitted to the CES for co‐financing, apparently because of staff shortages. How does the Commission intend to resolve the problem of staff shortages and speed up the processing of projects?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 52 by <span class="bold">Anna Terrón i Cusí </span>(H−0233/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Common external service</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that since the CES was set up the processing of many applications from non‐governmental organisations for Commission funding has been held up, does the Commission believe that it has the number of officials required for the CES to fulfil its remit?</p>
<p class="contents">Joint answer</p>
<p class="contents">At the outset, the Commission wishes to pay tribute to the work carried out by NGOs in Third World development and notably with disadvantaged groups of the population in some of the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively exploring means of streamlining procedures for the selection and management of the very large number of individual NGO projects benefiting from Community grants. The outcome of this work will go much of the way to addressing the concerns raised by the honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The newly‐established Joint Relex Service plays a key role in this process as its remit includes the simplification and harmonisation of funding procedures in all areas of external policy, excluding humanitarian assistance where the Commission has already proceeded with a simplification of procedures by means of a specific instrument to this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decision establishing the Joint Relex Service, set up on 1 July 1998, foresaw a staffing level of 648 plus the Director General, six Directors and staff directly attached to them. However this level has not been reached, notably because of the reduction in the 1999 Budget for appropriations for external staff. The Commission is considering urgently how to deal with this shortfall in the staffing of the Joint Relex Service. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 53 by <span class="bold">Roberto Speciale </span>(H−0237/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Trade in human beings in the Sudan</p>
<p class="contents">Recent reports in an Italian national daily newspaper have highlighted the existence of trade in human beings in Sudan, especially in the south of the country, including minors from the Dinka and Nuba tribes in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of this situation?</p>
<p class="contents">If so, has it contacted the Sudanese authorities to verify these reports and express the European Union's total opposition to such practices?</p>
<p class="contents">What reprisals mights the European Community take in order to end this trade (beginning with the suspension of all aid and cooperation programmes)?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Following allegations in the international press about the existence of contemporary forms of slavery in Sudan, the Commission has been monitoring this issue very closely. Continuing human rights abuses take place in both civil war and civil rights contexts. The Commission is very concerned about the impact of the current conflict in Sudan on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the lack of respect of human rights and human rights violations, the Commission suspended its development cooperation with Sudan in 1990 and development assistance was phased out. This position continues in 1999 reflecting the concerns of the Union in respect of human rights violations, the lack of moves towards democracy and the armed conflict in the south.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to follow the situation in Sudan very carefully and avails itself of every opportunity to urge the Sudanese government to allow unimpeded access for monitors and international observers and to investigate allegations on abduction promptly, publish their findings and punish offenders. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 54 by <span class="bold">Clive Needle </span>(H−0289/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Outstanding payments</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst numerous complaints concerning outstanding payments from the Commission to organisations carrying out valuable work in the field of development, a company based in the East of England has now been forced to close because the Commission has not made the relevant payment.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission explain what progress has been made in improving the efficiency and speed of payment and what assurances are being given to companies and organisations legitimately seeking to contribute to programmes supported by Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission very much regrets the delay which occurred in making a payment to the company in the honourable Member's constituency, a delay which was exacerbated by the fact that the payment was made to the incorrect account after the beneficiary had changed their bank.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the Commission has taken steps to speed up payments and has set its services a deadline of 60 days from the receipt of a valid payment claim to the transfer of the payment from the Commission bank account. Nonetheless, this deadline is still exceeded in too many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve the management of external aid, including in the area of development, the Commission established a new directorate‐general in 1998, the Joint Relex Service. One of the tasks of the SCR is to simplify procedures in order to make the handling of payment requests more straightforward.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be done, inter alia, by the simplification and harmonisation of procurement procedures and the standardisation of contracts. A clear and consistent definition of the documentation required from a beneficiary for a payment claim to be processed will assist both the claimant and the Commission services. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 55 by <span class="bold">Nelly Maes </span>(H−0304/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Use made of aid to countries at war in the Great Lakes region</p>
<p class="contents">The numerous wars currently in progress in Africa are kept going by a constant supply of arms. The Council considers that the Union should adopt a general approach to aid to countries at war. In particular, it should be ascertained whether European tax‐payers' money is being used to finance wars.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission completed its inquiry into the use made of aid from Member States to countries at war? Have the findings been announced?</p>
<p class="contents">Aid from the European budget to such warring countries as Rwanda and Uganda is indirectly equivalent to aid for arms procurement. Under the European structural adjustment programme for Rwanda, EUR 24.6 m is to be provided in budgetary aid.</p>
<p class="contents">How can it be maintained that European tax‐payers' money is not being used for arms procurement when for example Uganda's defence expenditure has risen by 27 % and when Rwanda is capable of occupying parts of Congo with a force of 16 000 soldiers who cost $180 per day?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Armed conflicts cause immense human suffering, destroy the efforts of human and economic development and undermine the solidarity among ACP countries, which is the basis for the Lomé partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent times vast regions of Africa have become war zones, others hosting millions of refugees and displaced people – 4 million in southern Sudan, almost 3 million in the Great Lakes region, several hundred thousand in Angola and other neighbouring countries of Congo – and about a dozen governments are spending scarce resources to buy arms and to sustain military efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Exceptional situations require exceptional measures. In parallel to the review of the institutional framework in the post Lomé negotiations, the Community has to undertake a profound review of its relationship with Africa from the point of view of conflict management and conflict containment, in addition to the efforts we already undertake in conflict prevention. The objectives of trade liberalisation and economic reform to facilitate Africa's integration into the global economy will become meaningless if substantial parts of the continent sink into chaos and protracted armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the close relationship established by the Lomé Convention, the Community has a special responsibility to assist the ACP countries in finding peaceful solutions to conflicts among them, but also the duty to ensure that any funds made available for ACP countries are used in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and with the foreign policy objectives enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, and in particular to prevent a diversion of funds for belligerent purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">A debate with the Member States of the Community on this issue has been launched and the Commission welcomes the honourable Member's question which brings the issue to the floor of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain measures have already been taken by the Commission in order to improve the existing control mechanisms: for all new programmes of direct budgetary assistance (notably structural adjustment support, STABEX and SYSMIN), the Commission introduces clauses for payment in instalments and periodic reviews of the financing agreement requesting full budgetary transparency from the beneficiary government. These evaluations are carried out in close cooperation with the international finance institutions. Furthermore a letter to the Head of Government of the beneficiary country expresses the Commission's concern about the involvement in armed conflict, the hope for an early withdrawal and for a constructive attitude of the government concerned in the search for a peaceful solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, however, that the response to conflict situations of the scope we are witnessing today in Africa cannot be limited to these steps taken by the Commission. The Community has to consider what measures can be taken to curb arms trade, to implement sanctions imposed by UN Security Council, to promote negotiations etc. But it has also to consider whether it is appropriate to continue with the present levels of development assistance to countries which are spending a considerable amount of their resources for military purposes that can hardly be justified as ‘legitimate self defence'.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the policy decision will have to be taken on a case‐by‐case basis, it is essential to make sure that measures are not taken in an isolated manner, but as part of a coherent strategy with clear and transparent objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 56 by <span class="bold">Concepció Ferrer </span>(H−0307/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU/South Africa trade agreement</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the free trade negotiations between the Union and South Africa, certain industrial products, particularly those in the textile and apparel sectors, have been affected by factors such as the asymmetrical dismantling of tariffs and the possibility of a much wider definition of mixed origin than in other agreements. Will the Commission explain what measures it is currently taking, or intends to take, to guarantee that the opening of markets is a two‐way process?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has negotiated a trade, development and cooperation agreement with the Republic of South Africa in accordance with the negotiating directives it received from the Council in June 1995 and March 1996. According to these last directives, the negotiations, in the trade field, were aimed at establishing a free trade area over a transitional period lasting, in principle, a maximum of 10 years and in accordance with the WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Between the main principles of the FTA, as foreseen in the negotiating directives, are those of asymmetry and differentiation. These twin concepts reflect the developmental approach of the proposed agreement. In recognition of South Africa's economic restructuring efforts currently under way, the Community will open up its market faster and more extensively for South Africa products than it will ask South Africa to do for Community products.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles are reflected in the different trade sectors, including textiles and clothing, where the Community will open its market faster and more extensively to South Africa than this country will open to the Community exports. In this particular sector, the principles of asymmetry and differentiation also reflect the different levels of competitivity of the industries of the two parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community aims to achieve the largest market access for its products into South Africa, including total free access, over an appropriate period of time. In exchange, it has offered to South Africa free access in a shorter period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the negotiations have been endorsed recently by the Heads of State or Government at the Berlin European Council. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 57 by <span class="bold">Richard Howitt </span>(H−0310/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Investment in ACP countries</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 24 of resolution A5‐0508/98<a href="#def_1_6" name="ref_1_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> , adopted in January this year, calls on the Commission to ensure that its development strategy to strengthen the private sector environment in developing countries specifically integrates the role of European‐based MNEs, and to progress an investment agreement with the ACP to promote economic growth and poverty reduction. Does the near future development agenda of the Commission include any initiatives to monitor European business and industry investment in the ACP countries through promoting codes of conduct so as to guarantee a coherent and transparent development policy that supports local development as well as foreign investment?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">1. The Commission has taken an increasing interest in matters concerning the role of multinational companies investing in developing countries. This is a logical result of the growing interest in stimulating the role of private investment in the context of development policies. The importance of the role of the private sector, including the support to foreign direct investment, has today become a major issue in the Commission's policy dialogue with developing countries. This applies in particular to the currently ongoing negotiations with the ACP countries on the successor agreement to the Lomé Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">2. With the emphasis on the importance of the private sector and foreign investments there is an equal growing attention to the behaviour and role of foreign companies in developing countries. In the post‐Lomé negotiations there is a prominent place for the definition of fair and social policies and the role of civil society in the implementation of development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">3. Thus the post‐Lomé debate seems to be laying the basis for a policy where the support to investment goes hand in hand with a growing attention for the conduct of private sector investors. The Commission will consider monitoring mechanisms as requested in the Parliament's resolution A5‐0508/99 in the frame of the above‐mentioned ongoing negotiations and the future cooperation with ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">4. Finally, it should be mentioned that the Commission is actively participating in the review of the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and supports the view that the principles laid down in those guidelines should be observed world‐wide by our Member States. It is also taking an active interest in company‐based codes of conduct and helps notably NGOs to discuss, sensitise and assess the conduct of multinational investors and it supports awareness campaigns in developing countries (through budget line B7‐6000‐NGO‐co‐financing). However, the Commission stresses the importance of the voluntary nature of ‘codes of conduct' and of ‘social labelling'. As mentioned in earlier replies to Parliament the Commission favours a policy of the ‘carrot' and not that of the ‘stick'. It prefers multilateral agreements to unilateral rules. The Commission favours the implementation of existing international rules such as those developed by the ILO.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 58 by <span class="bold">Patricia McKenna </span>(H−0223/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Foreign lecturers employed by Italian Universities</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission confirm that it received strong protests from the lecturers involved in this situation, alleging that inaccurate and incomplete information was being sent by the Italian authorities to the Commission concerning proceedings under Article 169?</p>
<p class="contents">Can it further confirm that one of the lecturers involved formally served the Commission with a copy of a complaint addressed to the Italian Director of Public Prosecutions concerning the transmission of this questioned information to the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">What steps does the Commission intend to take concerning the lecturers' fears that inaccurate and incomplete information is being processed with regard to the Article 169 proceedings?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission, in the interests of transparency and natural justice, use its discretionary powers to give the lecturers full access to all documents concerning the Article 169 proceedings?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission confirm and explain that it changed its pleadings in law without notifying the lecturers who are the complainants?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the lecturers consider that it has been misled by the Italian authorities. Furthermore, a copy of a complaint from the lecturers to the Italian Prosecutor alleging the transmission of false and misleading information by the Italian authorities was handed over to the Commission at the end of January.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission wishes to emphasise that, during the course of the proceedings, all information supplied by the Italian authorities has been carefully analysed and contrasted with the information supplied by the lecturers. On the basis of this permanent assessment of facts and evidence, the Commission considers that the information as a whole, which it has processed provides a reasonably accurate and complete picture. It must also be pointed out that, even in advance of receiving correspondence from the lecturers, complaining about the information supplied by the Italian authorities, the Commission had decided to send a supplementary reasoned opinion to Italy. This decision was taken after a full analysis of that information and precisely because the Commission did not accept the contention of the Italian authorities regarding compliance with Community law in the relevant universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Infringement proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty are brought against a Member State and complainants may not be considered as parties to the infringement proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission considers that giving individuals access to the infringement file would be contrary to the public interest within the meaning of the exceptions contained in the annex to the Commission Decision 94/90/ECSC/EC/EURATOM of 8 February 1994 on public access to Commission documents. Case law of the Court of First Instance has stated that the pre‐litigious correspondence between the Commission and a Member State, relating to investigations which may lead to an infringement procedure, falls under the heading of the protection of the public interest and thus warrants a refusal of access. The Court of First Instance has also confirmed that the public interest exception under the Code of Conduct is a mandatory exception and, thus, the Commission is obliged to refuse access to documents falling under such an exception. Given this clear jurisprudence, it has been the Commission's position that, if pre‐litigious correspondence between a Member State and the Commission is confidential and falls within the public interest exception, then a fortiori, the actual litigious pleadings based on Article 169 of the Treaty are similarly protected.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be mentioned, however, that this issue is currently the subject of legal proceedings before the Court of First Instance, in case T−309/97, where a complainant is challenging the Commission's refusal to deliver a copy of a draft reasoned opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission's legal position in the present case, it must be noted that the main claim which the Commission is putting forward in all its legal documents is the alleged infringement of Article 48 of the Treaty caused by the administrative practice of certain universities which seem not to have respected the acquired rights of the former language lecturers. The Commission's basic legal position has therefore remained unchanged since the beginning of the infringement proceedings. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 59 by <span class="bold">Hugh McMahon </span>(H−0306/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Foreign language lettori working in Italian universities</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion (Rule 147) for the Petitions Committee on the situation of foreign language lettori of 3 July 1997 (PE 222.503/fin), Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee requested that specific enquiries be made by the Commission to the Italian government concerning complaints coming from lettori at the universities of Verona, Naples, Salerno and Bologna where there have been mass sackings.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission report on these four specific universities and can the Commission confirm that these four universities will be used in its pleadings in law under the Article 169 proceedings currently in progress?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the opinion of the Social Affairs Committee on foreign language lecturers in Italy, the Commission gathered a large amount of information concerning the situation at the universities of Verona, Naples, Salerno and Bologna.</p>
<p class="contents">Such information has been used in the context of the infringement proceedings against Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The information and documentation collected by the Commission showed that the situation was not always clear in all universities. In many cases, the dispute between the lecturers and their university involved issues relating to national law together with issues relating to Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of earlier cases decided by the Court of Justice concerning the position of the foreign language lecturers in Italian universities the Commission has come to the view that Italy has the right to organise and reorganise its public service, including professors and lecturers at universities, as it deems necessary. Such organisation or reorganisation falls foul of Community law, however, if it perpetuates the discrimination against EU citizens and does not respect their acquired rights. Therefore, the Commission in its complementary letter of formal notice and complementary reasoned opinion has concentrated on the situation in nine selected universities, including the University of Naples, where the lack of respect for the acquired rights was, in the Commission's view, the most obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that it presently has sufficient proof in hand to bring the infringement procedure to a successful conclusion. Introducing the other universities mentioned in the question into the procedure would lead to further delays and complications which would not be in the interest of the Community and the individuals concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will pursue the infringement proceedings until a solution which is in full conformity with Community law is found. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 60 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−0229/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Western Sahara</p>
<p class="contents">Like other colonised nations, the people of Western Sahara are entitled to self determination and independence, but Morocco, which for nearly 24 years has occupied Western Sahara in breach of the UN Charter and international law, stands in the way. It has hampered, delayed and blocked the UN peace plan. Nevertheless, the EU is giving Morocco substantial economic aid.</p>
<p class="contents">What action does the Commission intend to take in support of the Western Saharan people's right to self‐determination and independence, and how does it reconcile EU aid to Morocco with the latter's occupation of Western Sahara?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely monitoring the implementation of the plan to resolve the Western Sahara conflict that was adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Moreover, as the Council presidency confirmed in a statement on 29 December 1998, we fully support all efforts made by the Secretary‐General of the United Nations to find a fair, equitable and lasting solution for Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the humanitarian aspects of this conflict are concerned, the Commission is continuing to supply substantial food and medical aid to the refugees in the Tindouf region through its NGO partners. The most recent instalment of this aid was adopted by the Commission on 20 October 1998 and totals EUR 10 million.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the financial assistance that the Community provides to Morocco comes under the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership that was launched in Barcelona in November 1995. This Euro‐Mediterranean initiative is not intended to replace the plan to resolve the conflict in Western Sahara that was adopted and that is currently being implemented by the United Nations Security Council. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Development aid and Morocco</p>
<p class="contents">Morocco is the greatest, or one of the greatest, recipients of EU development aid (ten years ago it was Ethiopia/Eritrea).</p>
<p class="contents">Exactly how much does Morocco receive every year (from all sources in the Budget)?</p>
<p class="contents">How does this priority for Morocco relate to poverty‐oriented policies of the Maastricht Treaty and the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The total amount allocated for the financial and technical accompanying measures that Morocco has benefited from since the MEDA regulation<a href="#def_1_7" name="ref_1_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> was adopted comes to EUR 454.48 million for 1996, 1997 and 1998. The funds are used, in particular, to support economic transition and sustainable economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures are more than just development aid and come under the terms of the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership that was established by the 15 Member States of the European Union and the 12 Mediterranean countries. One of the main aims of this partnership is to set up a Euro‐Mediterranean free trade area.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Aid for the Kingdom of Morocco</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1996 the Kingdom of Morocco has received Euro 140 million a year from the EU. Each year its continued occupation of Western Sahara costs a huge amount, and it is continually delaying the referendum proclaimed by the UN on the freedom and independence of Western Sahara. Is the Commission therefore planning to cut back or even completely stop the provision of funds to Morocco?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely monitoring the implementation of the plan to resolve the Western Sahara conflict that was adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Moreover, as the Council presidency confirmed in a statement on 29 December 1998, we fully support all efforts made by the Secretary‐General of the United Nations to find a fair, equitable and lasting solution for Western Sahara.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: EU security service</p>
<p class="contents">According to reports in the media, some of the staff of the EU's security service are members of extreme right‐wing organisations or have contact with them. Can the Commission confirm that this is the case? If so, does the Commission have any plans for measures to rectify the situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not keep any records of whether or not members of its staff – including the staff of the security service – belong to political organisations or parties.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 64 by <span class="bold">Renzo Imbeni </span>(H−0240/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Discrimination suffered by a disabled person on a domestic airline</p>
<p class="contents">Recently a domestic airline in a Member State refused to accept a reservation by a disabled person bearing the usual WCHC ticketing code and thus prevented the person from travelling. The reason given was that a person in a wheelchair can be transported only when accompanied by an able‐bodied passenger capable of assisting him, even though the person concerned had always travelled unaccompanied on other airlines. Does the Commission believe that this is consistent with Community legislation and the need to prevent discrimination against the disabled?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In many airports WCHC (wheel chair carry‐on, carry‐off) passengers need manual help, for example, to board the aircraft and ensure access for their wheelchair. Council Directive 90/269/EEC of 29 May 1990<a href="#def_1_8" name="ref_1_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> on manual handling of loads forbids airline personnel (among others) to carry heavy loads such as an electric wheelchair or its owner. Some European carriers therefore require that another person who is able to assist must accompany WCHC passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Existing Community legislation therefore does not prevent the airlines from requiring that WCHC passengers be accompanied by another person. It is, nevertheless, the opinion of the Commission that the passenger should be properly informed about this at the time of booking of the ticket, and not when he or she is actually presenting himself for check‐in.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is presently working on a Communication on passengers' rights in the air transport sector. Several relevant issues, including those relating to the provision of proper information to passengers whose mobility is impaired because of physical disability will certainly be covered in that publication. After public consultation, the Commission will give consideration to the need for legislative initiatives on these and other issues. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 65 by <span class="bold">Linda McAvan </span>(H−0244/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Anti‐racism training for customs and immigration officials</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament have on many occasions called attention to the racist and xenophobic behaviour which EU citizens of ethnic minority origin often encounter when exercising their right to move freely across internal EU borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission indicate whether it supports or would support an initiative to give customs and immigration officials in both the EU and the applicant countries anti‐racism training within existing European funding programmes such as Phare and the Odysseus programme?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The political conditions for accession to the Union, agreed by the Copenhagen European Council, stipulate that candidate countries have to achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing human rights and respect for the protection of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The institution building and training projects in the field of justice and home affairs under the PHARE programme include elements which seek to address the need for protecting human rights, including an equal treatment of minorities. These issues are covered in particular in the projects on transposition of the asylum acquis and police training on immigration matters which were launched earlier this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards measures within the Union, the Odysseus programme, which covers cooperation in the areas of asylum, immigration and arrangements governing the crossing of external borders, can be used to fund measures aimed at staff responsible for carrying out border controls, not least with a view to ensuring better compliance with the principles governing human rights and the protection of minorities. Where appropriate, the measures funded may involve the applicant countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 66 by <span class="bold">MaLou Lindholm </span>(H−0249/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Closure of smoke‐houses</p>
<p class="contents">According to information from the Food Administration and other sources, several small fish smoke‐ houses have been forced to close and even more are at risk. Small‐scale fisheries and small and medium‐sized smoke‐houses have a tremendously long history in Sweden and for decades have contributed to employment and small‐scale production in small coastal and island communities. As the EC directives allow exemptions for example for small‐scale poultry operations (92/116/EEC)<a href="#def_1_9" name="ref_1_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> and meat products (92/5/EEC)<a href="#def_1_10" name="ref_1_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> the Food Administration's interpretation was that the small‐scale exemption also applied to fish. An EU inspection of such premises revealed, without reasons, that this was not so. People in this trade are now being forced to either make expensive alterations to their premises (which most of them cannot afford) or to go out of business and become unemployed. At present DG VI is reviewing Directive 91/493/EEC<a href="#def_1_11" name="ref_1_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a> on health conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission's amended proposal allow general exemptions for small establishments, and can the small smoke‐houses and fish wholesalers affected be granted a stay of their alterations and exemptions until the new directive has been adopted?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products are governed by Directive 91/493/EEC. This Directive fixes a high level of health protection and allows for derogations in the following cases: </p>
<p class="contents">1. A derogation from the structural requirements for establishments. The possibility for granting such derogation has however expired on 31 December 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Small establishments which distribute on the local market and are situated in regions subject to particular supply constraints. For that purpose, the Commission has submitted, on 16 December 1992, a proposal to the Council in order to fix the minimal conditions to be respected by small establishments in certain parts of the Community. This has resulted in derogations for small establishments in Greece. However, the possibilities for exploiting this procedure have expire don 1 July 1992.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member of Parliament is pointing out, the Commission is preparing a proposal for a single hygiene text applying to all food, including fishery products. In this context the need for possible derogations will also be examined. The proposal will be submitted later this year, but its adoption may take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to point out, however, that Directive 91/493/EEC does not apply to retail sales and direct transfers on local markets of small quantities by fishermen to retailers or consumers. Theses sales and transfers must be subject to health checks laid down by national rules. It may be worthwhile to explore whether the production of smoked fish referred to by the honourable Member of Parliament falls within this category. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 67 by <span class="bold">Hubert Pirker </span>(H−0253/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Migratory movements in the EU</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 July 1998 the Commission submitted proposals amending Regulation 1612/68/EEC<a href="#def_1_12" name="ref_1_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> and Directive 68/360/EEC<a href="#def_1_13" name="ref_1_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a> (COM(98)0394/final)<a href="#def_1_14" name="ref_1_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a> . The new versions regard the reunification of families in an entirely new light, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A number of questions remained unanswered in the discussion of my opinion for the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">What actual effect have the provisions on freedom of movement had on movements of people within the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">What investigations have there been of the actual extent of migratory movements in the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's opinion, how large is the group of persons referred to in Article 10(1)(c) of the Commission proposal amending Regulation 1612/68/EEC?</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the provisions in the new Article 11 of Regulation 1612/68/EEC whereby such persons are given access to the labour market, consideration must be given to the effects of this right so that there is no additional strain on social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions on free movement of workers have been in force for the past 30 years. Nonetheless, only around 5 million Europeans have exercised their right to free movement and live permanently in another Member State (including all categories of persons: employed and self‐employed workers, retired and inactive people and students).</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural, social and linguistic barriers remain and the legislation has not resulted in major migration flows within the Union during the past thirty years.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission's proposals for amending Regulation 1612/68 on free movement of workers, Article 10.1(c) of the Commission's proposal only covers family members who <span class="italic">already</span> form part of the family household of a Community worker within the Union. First entry in one Member State of such family members, when they are third country nationals, would still depend on national immigration law.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this amendment is to ensure that a family household which <span class="italic">is already formed within a Member State</span> is not broken up due to the fact that the worker decides to exercise his/her right to free movement. Member States have no data on the number of people affected, but the Commission has no indication that the total number is significant.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the impact of the proposed Article 11 of Regulation 1612/68 on the national labour markets and national social security systems, family members of Community workers who are European nationals already have a direct right to work. The new provision would essentially benefit third country family members who were not previously covered by the family reunification rules of Regulation 1612/68.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the limited number of persons who would be covered by this new provision, it cannot be expected that there would be a significant impact – either positive or negative – on social security systems. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 68 by <span class="bold">Philippe Monfils </span>(H−0255/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Mismanagement of the Clovis crèche</p>
<p class="contents">The Clovis crèche, which has achieved notoriety as a result of the serious offences alleged to have been committed there by paedophiles, is managed by a company that has no expertise in this domain and does not comply with the contract specifications, with the result that there is high staff turn‐over, the prescribed ratio of staff to children is not observed, absurdly punitive methods of controlling the children are employed, and the meals provided consist of frozen, rather than fresh, food. Despite these irregularities, the contract has been extended until June 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that it is essential either to cancel the contract on the grounds of the company's failure to meet its contractual obligations, or at least not to extend it beyond June 1999?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The company that manages the Clovis crèche was selected following an invitation to tender that established the technical conditions for its management on the basis of contract specifications. The subcontracting agreement for the management of the crèche was signed on 23 June 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the points made by the honourable Member concerning non‐compliance with the contract specifications, I would make the following comments: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ in terms of the high staff turn‐over, 87 % of the nursery nurses were recruited between 1995 and 1997, and 49 % of them have worked there since 1995, when the contract with Esedra was signed, </p>
<p class="contents">‐ as far as the ratio of staff to children is concerned, a nursery nurse with at least three years" experience is present in every room, in accordance with the contract specifications; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ as regards the methods used to punish the children, the Commission has received no specific, detailed complaints about these. In view of the serious nature of such accusations and so that action can be taken at management level, including legal action if necessary, the administration must have conclusive information about the events and those involved. We have asked the parents" association for assistance here; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ as for the fact that the meals provided consist of frozen food, the contract specifications do allow this and it is also permitted by the national childcare organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The regular checks carried out by the Commission have not uncovered any serious instances where the company has failed to comply with the contract specifications to an extent that would justify immediately terminating the contract. Nevertheless, the Commission is continuing to monitor the application of the contract specifications in order to determine what attitude it should take throughout the duration of the contract. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 69 by <span class="bold">Esko Seppänen </span>(H−0257/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU Staff Regulations</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission's view on the question whether the same person may legally receive both a salary and a pension from an EU institution? If this should prove to be illegal, what does the Commission propose to do pursuant to Article 232 of the Treaty in the event of such a case arising?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Article 40 of Annex VIII of the Staff Regulations of the European Communities states that ‘a retirement or invalidity pension shall not be paid concurrently with the salary payable by an institution of the three European Communities nor with the allowance payable under Articles 41 and 50 of the Staff Regulations". This article does not allow for any legal interpretation that would enable an official to draw both a salary and a Community retirement or invalidity pension. However, if such a case were to arise, the Commission would rectify the situation in accordance with Article 41 of Annex VIII of the Staff Regulations and would recover the undue payment pursuant to Article 85 of the Staff Regulations. Possible disciplinary proceedings might also be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission carries out regular checks designed to detect cases such as this, while at interinstitutional level, software that was introduced in 1998 should prevent any such errors <span class="italic">a priori</span> through preliminary checks on a proportion of those beginning work in the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission does not see any link between Article 232 of the EC Treaty and Community salaries and pensions. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 70 by <span class="bold">Elly Plooij‐van Gorsel </span>(H−0258/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Compatibility of the French Electricity Act with the European electricity directive</p>
<p class="contents">On 2 March 1998 I tabled questions to the Commission on (proposed) French legislation concerning liberalisation of the electricity market which referred to the transfer of the electricity transmission network by the French state to EDF at an inappropriate transfer price. This would increase, in an unlawful way, EDF's capital.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission replied that it was not aware of this legislation, but that it would look into the matter I had raised. Can the Commission inform me of the results of this inquiry?</p>
<p class="contents">The French Electricity Act which has now come into force contains a provision to the effect that customers can change electricity suppliers only once every three years. Does this clause infringe the competition rules in general and the electricity directive in particular?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not as yet concluded its examination of the measures taken by the French authorities in transferring the general transmission network to EDF. It is looking at this issue in the context of its analysis of the various measures taken by the Member States to liberalise the electricity market in line with Directive 96/92. The Commission will take the necessary steps if it becomes evident that the measures taken by the French authorities contravene Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive does not contain any explicit provisions on the duration of contracts relating to the provision of electricity. As far as the Commission is concerned, this is a matter of freedom of choice which may come under the competition rules set out in the EC Treaty. The Commission is aware of an amendment adopted during the vote at first reading in the National Assembly requiring companies to agree to stay with the same electricity supplier for a minimum of three years. It is possible that by imposing a minimum period of three years, the authorities are introducing an unjustifiable restriction to the liberalisation of the market that is required by Directive 96/92, and are contravening Articles 5, 85 and 90 of the Treaty. The Commission will express an official view on this matter if the amendment in question is included in the final version of the law. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 71 by <span class="bold">Eva Kjer Hansen </span>(H−0262/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Infringement proceedings against Denmark over the registration tax</p>
<p class="contents">In its reasoned opinion of 18 May 1998 the Commission took the view that the provisions of Sections 114 and 115 in the Danish Ministry of Transport's registration order conflicted with Article 48 of the EC Treaty concerning the free movement of workers and Article 59 on the freedom to provide services, as they prevented persons residing in Denmark from using foreign‐registered company cars for business and private use in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend to pursue the matter to ensure that the provisions of the Treaty are implemented?</p>
<p class="contents">Would the Commission consider it sufficient a satisfactory solution for authorisation to be issued for the partial use of company cars in return for a periodic or daily charge, would it regard such double taxation of the vehicle as an unreasonably discriminatory arrangement?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Current Danish rules forbid the use of company cars registered abroad by crossborder workers who reside in Denmark. The Commission is of the opinion that these rules are incompatible with Articles 48 and 59 of the EC Treaty, and infringement proceedings against Denmark have been launched, following a complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of these proceedings, the Danish proposal for amendments to laws on registration of motor vehicles is being examined by the Commission, and the question of subjecting companies to double registration will be examined in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will keep the honourable Member informed. </p>

<p class="contents">In the Commission Communication and Fourth Report on the present situation and prospects for radioactive waste management in the European Union (COM(98)0799/final, of 11 January 1999), the Commission refers to numerous past Council resolutions dating back to 1989 on which the strategy has been promulgated, for instance in section 1.8. Why has the Commission made no reference at all to Parliament's report on the transport and storage of radioactive waste by rapporteur Mr Llewellyn Smith, A3‐0220/93<a href="#def_1_15" name="ref_1_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a> , adopted with amendments by Parliament on 16 July 1993? In particular, why has the Commission not responded to recommendation 17 of the report calling on the Commission to establish a complete database of all categories of radioactive waste by location in the Community?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would refer the honourable Member to its answer to her written question E−586/99. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 73 by <span class="bold">Alexander Falconer </span>(H−0264/99/rev. 1)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia</p>
<p class="contents">According to World Bank figures, prior to ‘ethnic cleansing', between 600 000 and 1.9 million workers out of a total workforce of 2.7 million in the former Yugoslavia were declared redundant under the US loan‐pressured Financial Operations Act, and GDP subsequently declined by 50 % as a result of the privatisation programme. Can the Commission confirm these figures, and, if so, can it indicate whether, in its opinion, this action was a factor in the ethnic cleansing operations?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot answer the honourable Member's question. Apart from the absence of dates or clear references, the question is not clear if it concerns the FRY or rather the countries of ‘former Yugoslavia'. In either case, the state has never ‘declared' workers ‘redundant'.</p>
<p class="contents">The near 50 % decline in GDP in the period between 1991 and the present, is due to war, sanctions, economic mismanagement and the dismantlement of the former SFRY economy, and certainly not to privatisation (which has not really begun) or to any single economic decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, whatever the impact of the events mentioned, or indeed of any economic event in the SFRY or the FRY in the last decade, the Commission is of the firm opinion that such events are in no way responsible for the nature of the war which followed.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility for the ethnic cleansing and the vicious nature of the war in the former Yugoslavia lies with the authorities in power. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 74 by <span class="bold">John Cushnahan </span>(H−0265/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Roaccutane</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that concerns have been raised regarding possible side effects of the drug Roaccutane? What action does the Commission propose to take in relation to these concerns?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that concerns have been raised regarding possible side effects of the medicinal product called Roaccutane, the active ingredient of which is Isotretinoin.</p>
<p class="contents">The medicinal product has been marketed in most of the countries in the Community since 1983. The use of the medicinal product is restricted to the management of severe acne which has failed to respond to other therapies. The medicine is available on prescription only, and in some countries its use is restricted to use by specialist dermatologists.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the time of first marketing, Roaccutane has been strictly contraindicated in women where there is any risk of pregnancy, since it is known to be teratogenic.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently new information on psychological side effects has emerged, and these side effects have been extensively discussed within the Pharmacovigilance working party of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products during the period from March 1998 until October 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Following these discussions, variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation have been introduced in all Member States where the product is marketed, including special warnings on the risks of depression, suicide or suicidal tendencies and the need for particular care to be taken with respect to the monitoring of patients who have been prescribed this medicine. These warnings have been introduced into the prescribing information and the patient information leaflets. In addition, as is normal with all marketed medicinal products, the national authorities continue to actively monitor safety data on Roaccutane.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore satisfied that the potentially very serious side effects of this medicinal product are well known and are being continually monitored by all Member States where the medicinal product is marketed and that measures are in place to assure additional follow‐up on new information if necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 75 by <span class="bold">Mihail Papayannakis </span>(H−0269/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Protection of the designation feta</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent judgment, the Court of Justice annulled the provision of the Regulation establishing feta as a protected designation of origin. Without wishing to interfere in the Court's proceedings, I believe it is imperative to ask the Commission for its opinion as to the accuracy of certain arguments put to the Court and to the public via the press. It was claimed, for example, that feta is a cheese produced from cow's, sheep's and goat's milk. What ‘scientific' study produced this finding when it is a well‐known fact that neither fresh nor powdered cow's milk has absolutely anything to do with feta? Does the Commission intend to reformulate the wording of the Regulation to make absolutely clear this distinction, which is important in terms of technology and flavour and will also help consumers recognise whether they are buying just any ‘white' cheese or feta and will protect genuine feta producers?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Greek regulation of 1994 governing practices that are 2000 years old, the name ‘feta" is reserved as a protected designation of origin for cheese produced in a specific geographic region and made exclusively with sheep"s milk or a mixture of sheep"s milk and goat"s milk according to a traditional method.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission confirmed this protection for the name ‘feta" at Community level through Regulation (EC) No 1107/96.</p>
<p class="contents">On 16 March 1999, the Court of Justice partially annulled this regulation on the grounds that the Commission had not given sufficient consideration to the situation in the other Member States. It should be noted here that although production of this cheese in France respects the traditional quality requirements mentioned above, the feta cheese produced in Denmark and Germany is mainly made with cow"s milk. However, since Directive 94/36/EC was adopted, the use of colouring agents to whiten feta cheese, which is initially slightly yellow, has been banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Court"s judgement and in view of the guidelines it has set out, the Commission must now review the entire ‘feta" problem and comply with the restrictions on substance and procedures that are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2081/92. It would therefore be premature to give a definitive response to the honourable Member"s question. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Impact of budget spending on employment</p>
<p class="contents">For two years in succession the EU has entered EURO 150 m in its budget for employment. What results have these funds produced? How many jobs have been created, in which industries and in which Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Growth and Employment Initiative (which committed 120 m ECU in 1998 and 150 m ECU in 1999 and year 2000, respectively) covers a programme of financial assistance for innovative and job‐creating SMEs. It aims at stimulating job creation by facilitating and strengthening the establishment and growth of SMEs, by supporting their investment activity through increased availability of finance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has implemented three types of facilities: the <span class="italic">EFT start‐up Facility</span> and the <span class="italic">SME Guarantee Facility</span> – on which the Commission has already initiated negotiations with Member States to set up and select financial intermediaries – and the <span class="italic">JEV Facility</span> . These facilities are currently in the implementation phase and, therefore, it would be premature to give a definite answer at this stage. The issue concerning the number of jobs created by these facilities will be addressed during the monitoring and evaluation phases. Their results will be included, as far as possible, in the annual reports that the Commission will present to the Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Employment Strategy establishes the orientation for priorities and focus of future employment policy at national and Community level. The targets and objectives of the Employment Guidelines set the course for their action while Community financial support is provided by the Structural Funds. The European Social Fund, in particular, has a specific mandate to financially support the European Employment Strategy. The main responsibility, however, for implementing the European Employment Strategy remains with the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 77 by <span class="bold">Gerard Collins </span>(H−0271/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Equality of opportunity in employment</p>
<p class="contents">The most recently published employment statistics from Eurostat show that while the rate of unemployment among men across the Union has decreased from 8.8 % to 8.5 % since 1992, the unemployment rate of women has actually increased from 11.4 % to 11.7 %. Can the Commission state what emphasis it has been putting on the need to promote equality of opportunity in its recent assessment of the national action plans?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, for the first time, Member States drafted National Action Plans (NAPs) in which they presented the way in which they were implementing the 1998 Employment Guidelines. In a communication published in May 1998<a href="#def_1_16" name="ref_1_16"><sup>(16)</sup></a> , the Commission examined the commitments made by the Member States as regards the four pillars of the Guidelines, including equal opportunities. Generally, the responses of Member States demonstrated that there was a clear commitment to making progress on employment. A number of positive elements could be discerned. All Member States had taken the issue of equal opportunities on board. Preparing the NAPs had raised awareness of the importance of equal opportunities policy. However the principal focus in the Plans was on the first two pillars, 'employability' and ‘entrepreneurship'. On the fourth pillar, the content of the NAPs addressing the issue of equality between women and men appeared to be modest and insufficiently detailed. This was reflected in the relatively limited number of new measures proposed, the small budgets attributed (if mentioned), and the limited number of quantitative targets envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Employment Report<a href="#def_1_17" name="ref_1_17"><sup>(17)</sup></a> of 14 October 1998 presented an analysis of the implementation of the NAPs and a series of good practices in Member States. The Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Vienna in December 1998 considered this detailed examination. This led to the conclusion of the Vienna European Council that ‘employment is the top priority of the European Union' and that equal opportunities for women and men are a vital component of the whole employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have agreed to submit by 31 May 1999 a report, describing both the implementation of the 1998 National Action Plans and the adjustments to be made to it in 1999, inter alia, to take account of the changes introduced by the 1999 Guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1999 Employment Guidelines<a href="#def_1_18" name="ref_1_18"><sup>(18)</sup></a> concerning equal opportunities between men and women have been strengthened as compared with the 1998 Guidelines: Member States are urged to mainstream equality between women and men in all employment policy and labour market measures. This should allow the adoption of a gender‐mainstreaming approach in implementing the Guidelines. Furthermore, Member States will, as part of their policy to tackle gender gaps, also strive to promote equal pay for equal work or work of equal value and to diminish gender differentials in incomes. They will consider an increased use of measures for the advancement of women. The 1999 Guidelines also attach more importance to the reconciliation of work and family: Member States will design, implement and promote family‐friendly policies, including affordable, accessible and high quality care services for children and other dependants, as well as parental and other leave schemes. </p>

<p class="contents">The American Lear Corporation has produced a plan which entails the closure of its plant at Bengtsfors in Dalsland, Sweden. The town will lose 860 jobs at a swoop. The company's car‐seat production will be transferred to a plant which it is planning to build in Portugal. By relocating to Portugal, the company will receive an EU grant of SEK 75 million and a tax concession from the Portuguese government to the same amount. In addition, the Lear Corporation previously received an EU grant to maintain production at Bengtsfors and is now to receive a grant to move it away. Is it reasonable for EU funds to be used to move production from one assisted region to another? Surely only new production set‐ups should qualify for grants under EU subsidy rules? If this is not the case, should such a rule not be introduced? Does the Commission accept tax competition of this kind despite the fact that tax competition is contrary to the code of conduct on corporate taxation adopted in 1997? Does the Commission intend to investigate more closely the circumstances under which the Lear Corporation obtained the grant to transfer its production to Portugal? Are there, or have there been plans to produce statistics on the frequency with which EU grants result in companies moving their production from place to place within the EU without creating any more jobs?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 80 by <span class="bold">Jan Andersson </span>(H−0286/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Commission efforts to prevent distortion of competition in the internal market</p>
<p class="contents">Lear, the motor vehicle components company, has transferred operations from Bengtsfors in Sweden to Palema in Portugal as a direct result of receiving EU aid. As Lear is a major employer in Bengtsfors, the closure will have very serious consequences for the whole district. All over Sweden, people are quite rightly up in arms about EU resources being used to shed jobs. The EU's inability to do more to ensure that structural aid and regional development grants do not distort competition is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">What action can the Commission take to prevent structural aid from being used as direct aid to companies and thus from contributing to a distortion of competition which results in jobs being lost at other locations which are in need of jobs, as has happened at Bengtsfors?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 81 by <span class="bold">Yvonne Sandberg‐Fries </span>(H−0288/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Internal market and relocation aid</p>
<p class="contents">The Lear motor parts factory in the Swedish industrial town of Bengtsfors has decided to relocate parts of its operation to Palema outside Lisbon (Portugal). It appears that one reason for the decision was that it will give the firm access to higher levels of EU aid. Lear is a major employer in Bengtsfors, and the closure will hit the local community and its inhabitants very hard. Many people are currently indignant – and rightly so – at EU funds being spent to take away people's jobs. The public must be clearly informed of what measures are being taken to prevent structural fund/relocation aid being used as an inadmissible competitive advantage to entice firms away from another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that the use of structural aid in connection with Lear's relocation from Sweden to Portugal may be seen as having contributed to a distortion of competition, thereby conflicting with the very spirit of the EU's regional policy? What measures does the Commission propose to take to ensure that the use of structural fund and relocation aid does not result in the kind of distortion of competition we have seen in the case of Lear?</p>
<p class="contents">Joint answer</p>
<p class="contents">In a Community where one of the basic principles is the freedom of establishment, any enterprise can decide to set up where it wants to or to transfer its activity from one area to another. Most often, this kind of decision is taken in a broader context of rationalisation or development of an investment plan. The elements which are taken into account by a firm in deciding on localisation are numerous and, in general, unknown to the Commission. The possibility of obtaining aid is but one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards national aid for regional development purposes, the Commission considers that this aid is compatible with the single market and in conformity with Articles 92‐94 of the EC Treaty if it conforms with the rules adopted by the Commission under its competition policy. These rules restrict inter alia the geographical scope and the admissible intensity of the aid. At the request of the Member States and subject to the Commission's approval, Community Structural Funds may part‐finance the approved national aid. In doing so, the Structural Funds compensate for the lack of resources available in disfavoured regions to assist their enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the investment by Lear corporation in Setubal, Portugal, the Commission can confirm that, according to information provided by the Portuguese authorities, public aid of 10.7 million euro will be paid in accordance with the PEDIP programme approved by the Commission in 1994. Of this amount 75 % is co‐financed by the Structural Funds. Of these 8 million euro, 2.5 comes from the European Regional Development Fund and 5.5 from the European Social Fund. In addition, the Portuguese authorities have agreed to provide up to 5 million euro in fiscal credits. Setubal being a region which qualifies as a least‐favoured region both under Article EC 92.3.a and under Objective 1 of the Structural Funds, this assistance complies with the Community competition rules on State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be emphasised that, according to the information available to the Commission, the investment is part of a wider strategy of the enterprise to expand its activities in Europe. The investment in Portugal amounting to 73.5 million euro, it is expected to create 4022 new jobs. At the same time, the company operates a reorganisation of its production facilities in Sweden. This includes the transfer to Thailand of most of the sewing activities of the Bengstfors plant, representing 280 jobs, whereas the production and assembly activities of the plant are transferred to Göteborg, which is a non‐assisted area. These elements indicate that there is no direct link between the company's reorganisation in Sweden and its greenfield investment in Portugal. It follows that, in the present case, the Commission is not of the opinion that Community funding has been used for the relocation of jobs into Portugal at the expense of jobs in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general level, the Commission agrees that efforts should be made to discourage ‘subsidy shopping' by investors and to avoid investments being (re)located purely as a result of the availability of aid. What is more, the Commission has already taken concrete steps in that direction: </p>
<p class="contents">* In 1997, the Commission has approved new Guidelines on national regional aid. The new Guidelines contain a special provision requiring Member States to make the granting of regional aid conditional on the maintenance of the investment concerned for a minimum period of five years. Member States have until 1 January 2000 to bring their existing regional aid schemes in line with this new provision.</p>
<p class="contents">* With respect to the next programming period, the Commission has proposed, in Article 29 of the draft Regulation laying down general provisions of the Structural Funds, that the Member States shall ensure that an operation retains the contribution from the Funds only if that operation does not, within five years of the date of the decision of the competent national authorities or the managing authority on the contribution of the Funds, undergo a substantial modification resulting notably from a cessation or change in location of a productive activity.</p>
<p class="contents">* Finally, in the recently issued guidelines for the next programming period, there is a statement of principle that the Structural Funds should not be used for the mere relocation of existing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 82 by <span class="bold">Vassilis Ephremidis </span>(H−0276/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Urgent need for intervention to save the historic monastery of Apostolos Andreas in occupied Karpassia</p>
<p class="contents">The historic monastery of Apostolos Andreas in occupied Karpassia is in a dire situation and in immediate danger of collapse. This monument to the religious, historical and cultural heritage is the sole surviving monastery in the occupied territories; all the others have either fallen into ruin or have been converted into mosques by the occupying regime which is engaged in a campaign of cultural cleansing and falsification of the history of the occupied territories, allowing – or encouraging – looting, the sale of priceless objects, vandalism and destruction of historic sites, museums, works of art and churches.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that the Monastery of Apostolos Andreas is not only important for Cyprus and Greek civilisation but is also part of the European and international religious, cultural and historical heritage, will the Commission say what measures it will take to activate and implement the agreements and programmes for the preservation and conservation of the cultural heritage and send a team of scientists and engineers to preserve and restore the monastery in question? What measures will it also take to protect the other historic and religious monuments, buildings and objects threatened with vandalism and destruction, which would deprive world civilisation of its inalienable riches?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth financial protocol between Cyprus and the EC provides for the possibility of financing projects between the two communities and it is possible that the action suggested by the honourable Member could be included in that context. However, since December 1997, when Mr Denktash decided to suspend all contact between the two communities following the Luxembourg European Council, we have not been able to consider any projects for possible funding. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 83 by <span class="bold">Manuel Medina Ortega </span>(H−0280/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Fishing agreement with Argentina</p>
<p class="contents">What action has the Commission taken to ensure compliance with the present fishing agreement with the Argentine Republic, and what safeguards are there for maintaining the activity of the Community fleet in those waters?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">1. What action has the Commission taken to ensure that Argentina complies with the fisheries agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries agreement between the EU and Argentina, which entered into force on 24 May 1994 for a period of 5 years, provides for the establishment of joint enterprises and temporary joint ventures.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of 27 joint enterprises have been set up involving 29 vessels that have been transferred permanently to Argentina; 15 of these fish for ‘hubbsi" hake. The three temporary joint ventures that were formed, involving three vessels, are now coming to an end and the vessels are returning to the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, since the entry into force of the fisheries agreement, Argentina"s catch of ‘hubbsi" hake has increased so much that its survival is threatened. As a result, the Argentinian Government has proclaimed a ‘fisheries emergency" and is adopting a series of management and conservation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">During the seventh meeting of the joint committee – held in Buenos Aires on 4 and 5 May 1998 – the parties recognised that the scarcity of the resources was not due to the activities of vessels that had been transferred to Argentina under the fisheries agreement, but rather to the inadequacies of the Argentinian system of managing and controlling its resources.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Community has always supported any conservation measures aimed at ensuring that sustainable and rational use is made of resources. The Commission has often stressed that it supported all conservation efforts that were not discriminatory and that were adopted in a transparent manner on the basis of objective scientific criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Through Resolution 2/99 of 5 January 1999, the Argentinian Government adopted a conservation measure reducing each vessel"s maximum catch for 1999 by 50 % compared with 1997. It also established three fishing zones according to the type of vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this resolution affects the fishing activities of the vessels operating under the agreement. It was adopted without consulting the Community, either before or immediately following its adoption; it therefore contravenes Article 9(1) of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards its substance, the Community has established that this measure represents an average reduction of more than 65 % in the individual quotas allocated to these vessels. In addition, the Community considers that the establishment of fishing zones has no scientific basis and is not provided for in the agreement. It also prevents those involved from fully exercising the fishing rights they were granted under the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, this resolution, which was adopted unilaterally by Argentina, disrupts the overall balance of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission explained to the Committee on Fisheries at its meeting on 15 and 16 March 1999, it has made its position clear to the Argentinian authorities on several occasions, including in a letter of 25 January 1999 from Mr Cavaco, the Director‐General of DG XIV, to Mr Auguste, the Argentinian Deputy Secretary of State for Fisheries. In addition, talks were held on 2 February between Mrs Bonino, the European Commissioner, and Mr Alonso, the Argentinian Secretary of State for Fisheries, and a letter was sent on 1 March from Mrs Bonino and Vice‐President Marín, the European Commissioner, to the Argentinian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Di Tella. Moreover, in accordance with Article 10 of the agreement, the Community asked that an extraordinary meeting of the joint committee be convened.</p>
<p class="contents">The letter from Vice‐President Marín and Mrs Bonino protested against the new measures adopted by Argentina and asked that the appropriate changes be made to preserve the overall balance of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">During the meeting of the joint committee, which was held in Buenos Aires on 4 and 5 March 1999, the Commission reasserted its position and asked that the reductions should be applied on the basis of the quotas allocated to each vessel and that the zones should not be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Argentinian delegation showed no flexibility in trying to rectify the situation and reestablish the overall balance of the agreement. It reminded the Community that EUR 6 million had yet to be paid in the context of scientific and technical cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">2. What safeguards are there for maintaining the activity of the Community fleet in Argentinian waters?</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member is aware, under the agreement substantial financial aid was paid to Community vessel owners who formed a joint enterprise in Argentina with a view to transferring vessels there permanently. As a result, we cannot talk about a Community fleet that operates in Argentina; we should instead look on it as a section of the Argentinian fleet operating under the fisheries agreement that expires on 24 May 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The vessels transferred under the fisheries agreement are Argentinian vessels and should benefit from the same safeguards as the rest of the Argentinian fleet. The Community will continue to ensure that these vessels are not discriminated against in any way, in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the fisheries agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 84 by <span class="bold">John McCartin </span>(H−0282/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Amnesty International claims concerning human rights in Egypt</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of Amnesty International claims regarding a worsening human rights situation in Egypt, particularly in respect of the numbers of deaths and the torture of prisoners in custody? Has the Commission raised in its contacts with the Egyptian authorities the situation surrounding the death in 1996 of Karimi Nduthu, the Secretary‐General of the Release Political Prisoners Group, into which no inquest has yet been held?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is informed about the human rights situation in Egypt and is consistently monitoring developments. This includes the reports by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations concerning the question of alleged deaths and torture of prisoners in custody.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not discussed the case of the death of Mr Karimi Nduthu with the Egyptian authorities. Karimi Nduthu, Secretary‐General of the Release Political Prisoners Group, was a Kenyan citizen; the Release Political Prisoners Group is a Kenyan human rights organisation and his death took place in Kenya. To the knowledge of the Commission there is no connection with Egypt. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 85 by <span class="bold">Karin Riis‐Jørgensen </span>(H−0283/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Travel discounts granted on social grounds to certain sections of the population in Denmark</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, the State provides subsidies so that certain sections of the population (pensioners, those on national service, etc.) can travel at reduced rates or free on public transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish government is required to send information to the Commission on its financial links with public‐sector undertakings, including financial remuneration for tasks which undertakings carry out for public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Is discrimination between passengers using public‐sector and private‐sector transport undertakings admissible with regard to travel discounts granted on social grounds? Will the Commission also state whether the Danish government has sent information on the subsidies paid to DSB (Danish State Railways) and other public‐sector transport undertakings in connection with such discounts?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member will know, different fares by different operators for particular social groups and for travelling at different times are normal in public transport. They are not, in themselves, evidence of discrimination by public authorities and they may result from the varying cost structures or pricing strategies of different operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Even where fare discounts are funded by state aids (in accordance with Regulation 1191/69), differences in the availability of aids for different types of operators may reflect sound transport policy judgments by the authorities that grant the aids, or they may be due to various acceptable priorities pursued by different competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In general – and for obviously practical reasons – questions of possible discrimination are assessed at the national level. Community interest in such questions arises only when Community considerations are relevant particularly, for instance, where there is significant cross‐border operation of transport services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish authorities have only transmitted a figure for aids to Danish State Railways and the sums relate to a combination of aids for tariff obligations and for obligations to operate. For 1997 (the latest year for which figures are available) that total was 1, 671.1 million Danish krone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not ask for information about aids for other forms of passenger transport, such as buses and light rail, as these sectors are not liberalised in the Single Market and financial support is therefore not likely to distort competition in the Community. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 86 by <span class="bold">Lone Dybkjær </span>(H−0287/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Blue Flag campaign</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, the Commission decided to end its financial support for the Blue Flag campaign. The main reason for doing so, it said, was that it had received a large number of official complaints about the campaign. The Blue Flag coordinators repeatedly asked the Commission to let them know how many complaints had been received and what they were about, but the Commission refused to provide such information, citing the need to protect the plaintiffs. The Commission's manner of dealing with this matter raises a number of general questions concerning openness and fairness in connection with the allocation of support to NGOs: </p>
<p class="contents">Are organisations against which complaints have been lodged able to ascertain how many complaints have been received and what they are about?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission have legal reasons for withholding such information?</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission considered that it might be possible to tell those against whom complaints have been lodged what the complaints are about without revealing the identity of the plaintiffs?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member refers to the issue of access to information relating to complaints about the Blue Flag campaign, the Commission replies to the questions concerning access to information in the light of this specific case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission received in 1998 some complaints about a possibly doubtful attribution of Blue Flags for some beaches. The letters raised issues related to criteria of the Blue Flag scheme, which falls outside the Commission's competence, where only water quality under the Bathing Water Directive is covered. Because the Commission has only the competence to control matters under Community law, it advised the complainants to refer their concerns to FEEE European coordinator, who is responsible for the Blue Flag campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">FEEE asked for information in the said letters. Pursuant to the rules in Commission Decision 94/90/EEC on public access to Commission documents<a href="#def_1_19" name="ref_1_19"><sup>(19)</sup></a> , an applicant for documents – in this case FEEE – is referred to the author if these documents originate from outside the Commission. However, as in the subject case authors are complainants, whose identity under the Commission rules on handling of complaints is confidential, FEEE could not be referred directly to the authors, but the Commission advised the authors to contact FEEE as explained above. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 87 by <span class="bold">Alan Gillis </span>(H−0293/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Working time Directive</p>
<p class="contents">Given the continuing non‐respect of the working time Directive by the Health Boards in Ireland with regard to the working hours of non‐consultant hospital doctors and general medical practitioners employed by the Health Boards, in some cases as many as 108 hours per week, what measures will the Commission take to ensure an urgent end to this situation which is causing grave damage to the health of our medical practitioners working in these deplorable conditions and in the long term putting patient care at risk?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to doctors, it should be noted that the provisions of the Working Time Directive (93/104/EC)<a href="#def_1_20" name="ref_1_20"><sup>(20)</sup></a> do not apply to ‘doctors in training'.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not clear whether the doctors referred to in the question fall under the definition of ‘doctors in training'. Since Member States are responsible for the implementation of Directives, complaints alleging breaches of national laws implementing a Directive should be addressed to the relevant national courts in the first instance.</p>
<p class="contents">Where it appears to the Commission that a Member State has failed to implement the provisions of a Directive, the Commission will investigate the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has clearly stated that the working time of doctors in training needs to be reduced. That is why it has already proposed to apply the provisions of the Working Time Directive to them. Under the proposal<a href="#def_1_21" name="ref_1_21"><sup>(21)</sup></a> , weekly working time would be limited to a maximum of 54 hours on average for a transitional period of 7 years and to 48 hours on average thereafter. This proposal is presently being examined by the Council and the Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 88 by <span class="bold">James Fitzsimons </span>(H−0296/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Coastal protection</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission indicate what action it proposes to take to promote greater emphasis on coastal protection policies, particularly in areas such as the east and south‐east coasts of Ireland?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's Demonstration Programme on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) was launched in 1996 as a response to the Council Resolution of 6 May 1994 calling for a Community strategy on integrated coastal‐zone management (94/C 135/02).</p>
<p class="contents">The programme is based around 35 local and regional projects, a series of cross‐cutting thematic analyses and research projects. These activities are designed to document, assess and confirm or disprove the hypothesis presented in the Communication from the Commission to the Council and Parliament on the integrated management of coastal zones (COM 511/95)<a href="#def_1_22" name="ref_1_22"><sup>(22)</sup></a> that the continued degradation and mismanagement of many of Europe's coastal areas can be traced to problems related to insufficient coordination between different levels and sectors of administration, insufficient participation and consultation of all of the relevant actors and insufficient or inappropriate information, both about the state of the coastal zones and also about the impact of human activities (economic and non‐economic).</p>
<p class="contents">As well as providing concrete examples of good practice in ICZM in a range of socio‐economic, cultural, administrative and physical conditions, the Demonstration Programme is also intended to be the raw material for proposing the development of a European Strategy for ICZM.</p>
<p class="contents">A document has been compiled by the Programme's thematic experts presenting the conclusions of the programme to date and launching the question about the appropriate contents and form for a future European Strategy on ICZM, consistent with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. This document will be diffused in late April with comments welcomed until the end of September, following which the Commission will prepare its final recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Further information on the programme can be found on the Web page europa.eu.int/comm/dg11/iczm/home.htm.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has identified for the period 1999‐2002 the monitoring and managing of coastal processes and the coastal zone as a specific topic in the Fifth RTD Framework Programme (item 3.3 of the Programme ‘Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development', key action ‘Sustainable Marine Ecosystems'). In the first year, projects will concentrate on integrated studies on land‐ocean interaction while for the second year coastal protection against flooding and erosion and coastal processes monitoring are prioritised topics. The call for proposals of 20 March 1999, not being restricted to a particular European area, gives a good opportunity to propose also research projects for the east and north‐east coast of Ireland.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Europol help‐line</p>
<p class="contents">Once Europol is fully operational, does the Commission consider that, in the context of fighting transnational organised crime, it would be possible or advisable for an EU‐wide free phone line to be set up to enable EU citizens to contact Europol in order to pass on information that might help to tackle organised crime, drugs and trafficking in human beings?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not consider that it would be advisable to set up a Community‐wide free‐phone to enable citizens to contact Europol to pass on information that could help to tackle organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of Europol is to improve the effectiveness and cooperation of the competent authorities in the Member States in preventing and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime where there are factual indications that an organised criminal structure is involved and two or more Member States are affected by the forms of crimes in question in such a way as to require a common approach by the Member States owing to the scale, significance and consequences of the offences concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is still the task of the authorities in the Member States to evaluate information and intelligence in accordance with national law. It is then the task of the national units within the Member States to supply Europol on their own initiative with the information and intelligence necessary for it to carry out its task. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Dumping of munitions in the Irish Sea</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will recall my question tabled in 1995 (H−0696/95)<a href="#def_1_23" name="ref_1_23"><sup>(23)</sup></a> on the extensive dumping by the UK of munitions, including chemical weapons, in the Irish Sea and off the north‐west coast of Ireland over a period of years (1920‐1945).</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission now indicate what it believes the position to be as regards the dumping of these munitions and chemical weapons and to what extent it has pursued this issue since I first raised it in 1995?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognizes, as Mrs Bjerregaard stated on 10 October 1995 in reply to Oral Question H−696/95<a href="#def_1_24" name="ref_1_24"><sup>(24)</sup></a> , that there is a potential risk posed by munitions including chemical weapons dumped in the Irish Sea and off the North West coast of Ireland in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is however more appropriately addressed by the Member States concerned in the context of the OSPAR Commission. OSPAR, the body responsible for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, last year agreed strategies aimed at progressively limiting the input of hazardous substances to and ionizing radiation in the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">While these strategies are basically aimed at preventing future activities harmful to the marine environment, OSPAR will, based on a document prepared by Ireland, discuss possible action on this issue at its next Heads of Delegation meeting in May.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the understanding that the Irish document will contain updated information on munitions dumped in the past and more recent events such as the washing up on beaches of weapons which have ‘escaped' from the dumping sites. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 91 by <span class="bold">Liam Hyland </span>(H−0302/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Prospects for the future rural policy</p>
<p class="contents">A quarter of the population of the European Union lives in rural areas. Looking to the future and given the need to ensure that the number of people living in rural areas throughout the European Union does not decrease any further, will the outgoing Commission indicate what it considers its legacy to be in relation to rural policy, how it views progress on the conclusions of the Cork Declaration, and whether it believes that the legacy of the Berlin Summit will be the preservation of rural life, jobs, culture and a unique European heritage?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Agricultural Council compromise and the Berlin Council Conclusions put into place the framework for rural development proposed by the Commission, that is, to establish rural development policy as a second pillar of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that previous reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Structural Funds created a patchwork of regulations and a territorially fragmented approach to rural development. Local and regional actors and rural communities were unable to fully play their role.</p>
<p class="contents">The current reform establishes a new framework for rural development which is built on the Cork Declaration. We have made programming, which now covers all rural areas, both simpler and more flexible and, indeed, compatible with the principles of sustainable development. It will tap into the potential of people and agencies living, working or operating in rural areas, and be reinforced by a Community initiative for local rural development. Above all, we now have an instrument which has the potential to accompany further change in the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has endorsed this framework as the most effective way of preserving rural life, jobs, culture and the unique European heritage. It is to be hoped that the financial resources available are enough to fully reap the benefits of this new approach. It is disappointing that suggestions by certain Member States to increase the budget available for rural development disappeared in the final agreement in Berlin. However, the new arrangements for rural development will be more flexible and would enable the budgetary authorities to rebalance expenditure were it thought appropriate. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Commission communication on a new association between the European Union and Latin America for the XXIst Century</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recently published a communication on a new association between the European Union and Latin America for the XXIst Century which coincides with the forthcoming European Union‐Latin America and Caribbean Summit to be held in June in Rio.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the importance of relations between the Union and Latin America: </p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend to carry out the proposals contained in its communication, and in what time frame?</p>

<p class="contents">What is the Commission's opinion of the proposals addressed at the European Union‐Latin America and Caribbean Summit contained in the Final Act of the XIVth Interparliamentary Conference?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission communication to which the honourable Member refers is to contribute to the preparations for the coming summit of the Heads of State and Government in Rio. Naturally, the Commission hopes that as many of the document"s proposals as possible will be accepted by the Heads of State and Government and thus reflected in the final texts adopted in Rio. It is hoped, in particular, that the Heads of State and Government will reach agreement on a priority programme of joint activities that would form the point of reference for cooperation in the years ahead. Clearly, the Commission and – at a bilateral level – the Member States will then have to translate the Rio conclusions into practical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that this approach answers the honourable Member"s concern about the development of a new global action programme for Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also taken due note of the message from the XIVth Interparliamentary Conference to the Heads of State and Government of Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Moreover, it is aware that there is substantial agreement between honourable Members and the Commission on two fundamental points in particular: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ firstly, the need to consolidate the central role of bodies promoting regional integration in dialogue with the EU; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ secondly, the need to allow bodies representing civil society to play a greater part in this dialogue than they have done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 94 by <span class="bold">Robert Evans </span>(H−0312/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Non‐EU countries joining the single currency</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that negotiations have taken place to allow three non‐EU countries, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City to join the single currency, can the Commission clarify the criteria for membership?</p>
<p class="contents">Are there other non‐EU states in the process of joining and, if so, is this not a completely anomalous situation and one that should be stopped?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">On 31 December 1998 the Council took three decisions authorising the conclusion of bilateral agreements on monetary issues and exchange rates between the European Union and the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City.</p>
<p class="contents">These decisions authorise France to conduct the negotiations with the Principality of Monaco and Italy to conduct those with the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City. The Council decisions lay down the position to be adopted in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">France and Italy have long been linked to the Principality of Monaco, in the case of the former, and the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City, in the case of the latter, by agreements on monetary issues and exchange rates. These agreements authorise the third countries in question to issue coins denominated, as appropriate, in French francs or Italian lire and stipulate that notes and coins issued by France or Italy are legal tender on the territory of the third countries in question.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting these decisions, the Council has honoured the commitment stemming from Declaration No 6 annexed to the Treaty on European Union, in which the Community undertakes to facilitate the renegotiation of existing arrangements with the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City following the introduction of the single currency. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 95 by <span class="bold">Markus Ferber </span>(H−0313/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Air quality in the buildings of the European Patent Office</p>
<p class="contents">Members of staff of the European Patent Office have been complaining for years of health problems caused by the air conditioning system and by noxious substances in offices. Following official complaints in this regard by several members of staff, the Patent Office commissioned a number of evaluations, the results of which were for the most part not made publicly available.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures does the Commission intend to take to induce the European Patent Office to make the results of the investigations on germ contamination available to the offices and persons concerned?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission urge the European Patent Office to say whether the air conditioning system has in the past been cleaned using chemicals and, if so, which?</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that the Patent Office carry out a standardized poll of all people working in its offices in order to shed light on the issue of ‘sick building syndrome'?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to take the necessary measures to establish a legal framework for the procedures dealt with by the invalidity assessment committees?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">International health and safety legislation must be complied with by the agencies and by all the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission has no authority in this area with regard to the agencies as they are independent bodies. The Commission is therefore unable to reply to the honourable Member"s question. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 96 by <span class="bold">Susan Waddington </span>(H−0314/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Discrimination at Border Controls</p>
<p class="contents">In its unsatisfactory response to my written questions, (P−2892/98, E−3769/98), the Commission stated that it is unaware of any problems of discrimination or racism against women during passport and customs checks, and therefore does not see a need to act. Such an answer belies the true state of affairs. As we have frequently seen over recent months, denying a problem's existence does not make it disappear. Given that the greatest weapon against discrimination is education, and in view of forthcoming Treaty changes, will the Commission now allocate resources to fund a study of the problem and measures designed to support the education of the officers who conduct these checks?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 97 by <span class="bold">Christine Oddy </span>(H−0317/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Passport controls and fight against racism</p>
<p class="contents">What steps are the European Commissioners taking to ensure that European Union borders internally are not being patrolled in a racist way which penalises black European Union citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the European Commission ensure that this is a priority after Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty comes into effect?</p>
<p class="contents">Joint answer</p>
<p class="contents">Border controls should not go beyond what is allowed by current Community legislation. Pursuant to this legislation, Member States must allow citizens of the Union to enter their territory simply on production of a valid identity card or passport subject only to the limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. Members of the family who are nationals of a country for which a visa is required must produce a visa and Member States shall accord to such persons every facility for obtaining them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view of the honourable MEPs that border controls should not give rise to racial discriminations.</p>
<p class="contents">Racist controls constitute an infringement of the fundamental law of every Member State. Moreover when they are carried out on the occasion of passing through the frontier, they are also contrary to the fundamental right to free movement for persons established in Article 8a of the EC Treaty. Above all, it is incumbent on the authorities of each Member State to ensure that their officials, in carrying out their duties, respect these fundamental rights, which implies a particular vigilance on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is worth noting that on 11 and 12 December 1998 the Vienna European Council underlined the necessity to fight against all forms of racism, both in the Union and in third countries. In this respect, the Commission was invited to present proposals to the forthcoming Cologne Council, which would cover applicant countries as well as Member States. Some such initiatives have already been undertaken in the framework of the PHARE programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission will analyse the possibility of proposing measures aimed at combating all forms of discrimination in the Union, including discrimination based on race or ethnic origin, once the new Treaty has entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in accordance with its statement of 17 March 1999, the Commission had decided not to take fresh political initiatives. </p>
