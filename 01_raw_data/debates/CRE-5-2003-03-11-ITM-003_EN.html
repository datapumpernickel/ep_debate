<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>The debate on the state of the Union is an established item on our agenda. It gives us the chance to look at progress in the year just ended and our objectives for the current year. This year, the debate falls at a particularly sensitive time in terms of both international affairs and the life of the Union. The Iraq crisis, enlargement and the Convention weigh so heavily on our minds and hearts that there is no need for me to mention them. I shall only stress that today's debate gives us all the duty to weigh up the opportunities and challenges connected with the unification of our continent and to reflect on the lessons to be drawn from the Iraq crisis at a time when we are drafting the new constitutional charter of our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with enlargement today. Last December, we wound up accession negotiations with ten countries. Ten countries we should now call ‘acceding’, not ‘candidate’ countries. Meanwhile, negotiations are going ahead with Bulgaria and Romania so that they can join shortly afterwards and, with the necessary adjustments, joint work is continuing with Turkey. In this regard, before you all, I want to express my thanks to the Commission staff and Commissioner Verheugen for their dedication and their hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union's task, however, in the area of enlargement does not end with the decision taken at Copenhagen. Indeed, Croatia's recent application shows that another region of Europe is knocking at our door. Here I refer to the western Balkans. I want to make it quite clear that the unification of Europe cannot be regarded as complete until the Balkan countries are members of the Union too. This prospect of membership must be clearly offered, while it must also be stressed that the criteria followed in the first round of enlargement will be applied just as strictly. After years of uncertainty, democratic debate in both the old and the new Member countries of the Union will now be on firm ground. The very positive outcome of the referendum in Malta is an auspicious sign and an incentive to even greater efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Important though it is, the accession of the new Member countries is only one stage in the process, and it must not obscure the fact that there is still much to do. The first job is to complete economic integration. The current 15 Member States can and must do much more to promote growth and employment and to reduce disparities. It is the future Members, however, those that are to join next year and those that will join a little later, which warrant the greatest attention. Our shared goal must be to foster sustained growth, strengthen cohesion, step up environmental protection, reduce disparities and, ultimately, encourage all to adopt the euro. Broadly speaking, those are the main points of our economic integration project.</p>
<p class="contents">While this is our first priority, the second task is to advance the political debate, and that is equally important. It is time we had an in-depth, honest, completely transparent debate on the type of Europe we want to build together. The very success of our integration has already made it unavoidable. The Iraq crisis and the state of international relations mean we can put it off no longer. The possibility of war in Iraq deeply stirs the feelings of Europeans because reconciliation and peace lie at the very foundations of the European Union. It affects us Europeans all the more here and now because chance would have it that four of our Member Sates and one candidate country are currently members of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, we have to guard against two temptations. One temptation would be to build a Europe that is in opposition to the United States. This crisis is marked by widely diverging views on the instruments to be used. These differences are important because they mark the line between war and peace, but they do not affect the ultimate objective of our policies or the solidity of our alliance or cast doubt on the whole web of transatlantic relations, our shared history and the extent of our bonds. The second temptation we must guard against is focusing solely on the dissension within the Union. Differing views have clearly emerged among both the 15 Member States and the future Members in recent weeks. However, as the extraordinary meeting of the European Council of 17 February rightly pointed out, we are all agreed on a large number of fundamental points. We all want the UN to remain the cornerstone of world order. We all support the Security Council in carrying out its duties. We all believe that war is not inevitable but, at the same time, we think that Iraq must be made to face up to its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, we must confront our weaknesses head on. Indeed, we Europeans not only have a political obligation to reach a common position: after Maastricht, we are obliged by the Treaties to show loyalty and mutual solidarity. The Member States on the Security Council have a particular duty to coordinate their actions and keep others informed of what is happening, while the permanent members should defend the positions and interests of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The mechanisms for this are clearly inadequate, but does this mean we have to wring our hands and conclude that the objective of joint action is unachievable? Absolutely not. Failure to put in place effective procedures and instruments that facilitate the emergence of shared positions will make it hard to forge a common Union foreign policy and will certainly delay it. Our imagination and our determination must be equal to the challenge. Giving in is absolutely out of the question. The questions before us, which we have to answer, are both difficult and crucial. What kind of Europe do we want? What guideline are we following? I personally cannot be content with a ‘supermarket’, or some sort of large Single Market. Do we not want to build a genuine political area that allows us to affirm and defend our principles and our values throughout the world? Then we cannot continue indefinitely in this state of ‘European schizophrenia’ in which we expect the Union and the integration process to provide prosperity and development while relying on the United States to guarantee our security.</p>
<p class="contents">European public opinion is remarkably clear about what it wants. The regular Eurobarometer surveys carried out by the Commission reveal that our citizens, in particular, want the Union to ensure their security, both at home and abroad. This afternoon, to step up our commitment in the defence sector, the College will adopt a Communication strengthening the European defence industry. On the question of war and peace – and we have had a spectacular and unprecedented demonstration of the public's views in the streets and squares of our cities – the shared views of the public know no barriers in Europe. This is a sign that the peoples of Europe are moving closer together, a sign which prefigures and anticipates the reform of the European institutions and procedures. This shared sentiment, this spontaneous sharing of values in no way reduces the importance of an in-depth, open political debate: it only emphasises the need for it even more. It was no accident that the Commission's first contribution to the Convention on 22 May 2002 proposed a project for Europe that highlighted, amongst other things, the need for a Union that can ‘exercise the responsibilities of a world power.’ One of the few benefits of the tragic Iraq crisis is that it is actually forcing us to talk honestly about the very nature of our way of coexisting and doing things. We must not be afraid of an open debate, for it is only through dialogue that possible solutions can emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the Convention. I have always believed that our mission was to bring about enlargement and reform of the institutions in parallel. As they stand, the institutions and procedures, conceived and designed for a community of six largely homogenous States, no longer meet the requirements of a larger, more diverse Union. That is why I feel it is positive that the candidate countries have been full members of the Convention right from the beginning and that they are making an active contribution to it. Indeed, I would like to stress that one of the most encouraging aspects of the Convention’s work is precisely the way delegates meet and work in a variety of mixed configurations that make any distinction between the representatives of the present and the future Member States essentially impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the time or the place to go into the progress made by the Convention, but I would like to say that the wide consensus on issues such as the constitutional nature of the text to be produced, the streamlining of instruments and procedures, the full inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the legal personality of the Union is grounds for optimism regarding its conclusion. As I have said, this is not the place to go into details, but there is one point I regard as essential, in the light of both the international crisis and the role the Union is called to play on the international stage; I am referring to the use of majority voting across the board. The requirement of unanimity actually causes paralysis, as we have seen in recent days. This is already the case now and will be even more of a problem in the enlarged Union we have decided to build. This is another reason why we need an open political debate on the new enlarged Europe. Only if we have devised a common project will we be ready to fully accept the basic rule of every democratic institution, which is majority voting. Only when we feel that we agree on all the basic elements that unite us will we be able to accept being in a minority whenever necessary while still feeling fully represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, today's annual policy strategy debate will define the political horizons and resource framework for 2004. It kicks off a process that will end with the adoption of the budget and the presentation of the legislative work programme for next year. Throughout this process, we shall be engaged in an intense detailed debate with Parliament and the Council in order to define the fundamental political options. I would stress that the work of the Parliamentary committees will be of crucial importance here, in particular. A new element in the strategy for next year is the 2004 – 2006 multiannual programme that is to be approved by the European Council, a completely new departure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that our interinstitutional cooperation will generate a work programme that matches our ambitions, and we have very high ambitions, as is quite clear from the political priorities we have set ourselves for 2004. Indeed, next year, our efforts will focus on enlargement, growth and internal and external security.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into the details of the individual aspects of this programme, I would like to draw your attention to the issue of our relations with countries that are already our neighbours or will be neighbours of the enlarged Union. I am referring to the band of countries stretching from Russia and Ukraine to Morocco. With this ring of friendly countries we propose to step up cooperation to start a process that may in time lead us to share ‘everything except institutions’ with all of them. A common market, a reinvigorated political dialogue based on shared principles and values and the harnessing of the full external potential of our common policies: these are the pillars of the new strategic concept for the Union that we are setting out in a communication on a ‘Wider Europe’. Only in a wider area of stability and prosperity can Europe deal safely with the sometimes disturbing developments on the world stage and fully exploit the opportunities offered by globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Like all Europe's policies for the coming years, this medium- to long-term strategy for relations with neighbouring countries calls for the preparation of a political project for the Union, and its financial implications will need to be determined. The medium-term political programme preparing the forthcoming Financial Perspective will play a key role here. The Financial Perspective must not only be in line with the constitutional Treaty that will emerge from the Convention and the subsequent intergovernmental conference but also lay the necessary foundations for an enlarged Union that strives to achieve three major political objectives: peace, freedom and solidarity. In this regard, by the end of the year or, at the latest, in early 2004, we shall put forward our overall political project for the enlarged Europe and outline the broad guidelines for the financial proposals it calls for. Then, we will prepare the relevant legislative proposals so that they are ready for adoption towards the middle of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">We have completed the enlargement negotiations. Now we must define the political project for the enlarged Union. This means we must say what can be done at Union level to foster and safeguard civil liberties, how the Union can complement Member States' laws in fundamental areas such as health, security and the area of freedom and justice, what policies at Union level can best contribute to sustainable prosperity in Europe, what objectives the Union should set itself to further regional and social cohesion in an enlarged Europe that will have much greater economic disparities than the Union of Fifteen, what changes will be needed in research policy and the Structural Funds to achieve those objectives, whether expenditure on cohesion should rise, fall or remain unaltered if economic inequalities are to be reduced both between Union countries and within the individual Members, and, lastly, what policies are needed to project the European model externally, particularly in countries that are close to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen today, the Union is a Union on a journey. A Union that must draw on present experience to grow stronger, so that it can assert its identity and its role in the world more decisively. The current crisis must serve as an incentive for us to speed up the reform process which is underway. This process is necessary irrespective of enlargement, but enlargement and the present international context make it even more imperative and urgent. Today, we have a chance to reinvigorate our unity. Our fellow citizens are calling for this and events leave us no choice. The Convention is a potential turning point in the life of our Community: let us all strive to make it a success. Together, we can succeed. Together, we can and must lay the political and financial foundations to complement the institutional basis and open this new chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">The work we accomplish together this year and next year will, to a large extent, dictate the nature and role of the Union in the world, the Union we will leave to future generations.</p>

It sets out the outline of Union finances post-2006, rightly asking which project we want in terms, for example, of the competences that the Union will have, the limits to the geographical size of the Union, and a whole range of matters which set our budget debate in the right perspective. First I shall deal with the substance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that we should have a range of ideas, with working groups set up by the Commission dealing with peace and prosperity and with questions of sustainable development. But in terms of the external side, the working group does not cover what the external dimension of the Union should be. As the President said about the current context, it would seem to be relevant that we should be thinking about substantive issues such as what the transatlantic partnership is going to be like in five years' time.</p>
<p class="contents">We have asked for a report. It has not been produced. Indeed, we included in the budget for this year – 2003 – a request to have a document drawn up. When one asks the question, 'what should be the strategic priorities for the Union in the external field to 2007?' a deathly silence descends.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, in terms of procedure, we should be a little careful that this Commission, although very active in looking forward to the next financial perspective, could bring us in theory to 2013, which not only covers the next Commission but also the Commission after that. To find ourselves in 2003 already discussing 2013 all seems rather far away.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context there is one specific question I would like to ask the President of the Commission. The last phrase of this interesting document says that the duration of the next financial perspective could be brought into line with the five-year mandate of the Commission and of the European Parliament. Does that mean that the financial perspective would be to 2010 instead of 2013? The PPE-DE Group is in favour of the financial perspective covering a five-year period. I would like some clarity on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">While talking about the Commission, Mr President, you mentioned the Convention. When we envisage a post-2006 Union with 500 million people or more, how will it be possible to run a Union with fewer Commissioners than we have today? There seems to be this refrain across the House at the moment that we should have 10 to 12 Commissioners. I do not see how we can run a Commission with only 10 to 12 Commissioners when most governments have at least 30 to 35 ministers to run their own countries. We are dealing here with the Union, a much bigger enterprise, so why not have 30 or 35 Commissioners?</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me quite normal that we should do so in the context of the Union of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the priorities of the budget for 2004 are well set out in the annual policy strategy document in terms of the three points that are made. Concerning sustainable growth, it makes sense to have better integration of environmental concerns. In addition, the PPE-DE Group is interested in the document concerning a better relationship with our neighbours in terms of security and stability. Above all, we are interested in the enlargement process and in making sure that we can fulfil our obligations and that Member States are fully integrated into the Union after 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share the view that the procedure for dealing with these policy strategies as they go through the committees and then through the budget process will be very important in order for us to be able to see that they are properly brought together.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions we will be asking concern the significant rise of 780 in staffing numbers and, in particular, whether we need so many civil servants in the interpretation and translation departments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to my group's priorities during the budgetary process. We remain faithful to what has guided us in the last few budgets in terms of three particular elements which are important to us. Firstly, the completion of the reform of the institutions. This is where the Commission started out. We would like to ensure that this reform is completed by the end of our mandate. We still find irritations here. Yesterday mention was made of a document which was quoted partially in the press about the ongoing affair of the chief accountant who has been suspended. We would like to see that document. It is not so secret - most Members, including myself, have a copy. Why is there this fear, this wish to keep secret a document that is already half-known? We would like to see that document as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of the A-30 subsidy lines – a specific, but very sensitive point for Parliament. We would like to be clear on what the Commission will be proposing in terms of these subsidies for particular institutions. We have differing views across Parliament as to what should and should not be benchmarked and we need a common approach on that.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment pertains to a letter I have from the Secretary-General about follow-up to parliamentary acts. Here we find that at least 25% or 30% of reports that we ask for in this House are never produced. It states with regard to Parliament resolutions on COS documents that, of the 490 requests we made last year, the Commission has decided not to follow up 104 cases. We would like clarification as to why the Commission is not doing what Parliament requests and we certainly feel that there should be some reflection in the budgetary process if the Commission does not wish to do what Parliament has requested.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying that this is a key moment in this budgetary process. The Commission has set out some useful lines of discussion and debate looking ahead post-2004. I hope that at the end of the process our Parliament will be able to reach the right conclusions in the interests of our citizens.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we are presented here today with a highly technocratic document and a speech by you, Mr Prodi. I would not want to deny that the speech, being political, is more to my taste. What I would like to do is to try and bridge the gulf between the two elements.</p>
<p class="contents">You are indeed right, President Prodi, to say that the framework conditions are far from favourable, and they will probably not be anything like favourable in 2004 either. The threat of war in Iraq has opened new fault lines within the European Union and also within the candidate countries. Today, unless there is radical change, our foreign and security policy lies in tatters, and economic developments – particularly where jobs are concerned – have not been as favourable as we expected. This means that we have to take a rather more critical approach to things.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with what enlargement is intended to achieve. It is indeed the case that we have to see to it that enlargement ends up being a success. To all those who – perhaps with the events of the last few months in mind – have given it as their opinion today that we have to delay enlargement, I would like to put the counter-argument that this would divide and weaken Europe still further. I concede, though, that many of us are disappointed at how little evidence there is among many of our neighbours – and, admittedly, among some of our members – of any emotional and intellectual attachment to the European project. They are right to say that the European Union is not a supermarket, and that it is not a bank either, one from which one just collects money for a few projects. Nor is it an artefact that exists only to be used as a justification when unpleasant but necessary reform measures have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that we have probably all failed – and not only in relation to the Iraq issue – to highlight the objectives and actual <span class="italic">raison d'être </span>of the EU as a peace project. President Prodi mentioned the International Criminal Court. Here too, we have neglected to convince the new members of the immense importance to us of, for example, the International Criminal Court, and also of the United Nations, and of how dear these multilateral institutions are to us. That was a mistake and a failure. Perhaps we are paying the price for what was sometimes a too legalistic and narrow view of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now proposing that we should establish a circle of friends around the enlarged EU, but, President Prodi, we have, over the past few years, not even managed to gain enough friends among the governments of the candidate countries, and we have to concede that the Americans have sometimes had more success in alienating at least the governments of certain countries even before their accession, using lobbyists' money, a closely-woven network of institutions and foundations, some of them funded by the diaspora, and, where necessary, pressure and threats as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also has the task of considering how we can counteract that, and how, above all at the level of culture and society, we can put the European idea across to more of the public, in addition to the united voice of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now deal with stability in and around Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too, I believe, we have to take a rather broader and deeper view of the individual regions and shape relationships along appropriate lines. The objectives involved are too imprecise and undifferentiated, as Russia needs to be handled in a different way from the Mediterranean, which in turn calls for an approach different from that taken to the Balkan countries, which, by the way, have been potential candidates ever since the Zagreb Summit even though this paper states that they have yet to acquire that status.</p>
<p class="contents">We must concede, though, that our visa policy as regards these countries – to which I travel very frequently – is lousy. Business people, scientists, journalists, students – all those who could help to foster friendship with these countries – are often deterred by a visa policy that is highly restrictive, mindlessly unmoveable and bureaucratic, irksome to these people and, above all, to the most important opinion leaders in the countries from which they come. We must of course have a restrictive visa policy, but these social groups could receive flexible treatment under it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the third objective – sustainable growth. I admit that this is a very vague concept, but it is one that already means a number of things to me. I simply ask myself whether we really do have a coherent policy for growth. We invest too little – not only in research and development, but also in infrastructure. Think of public transport, which could also do more for the environment. Too little is being done to make educational establishments more efficient while maintaining access to them for the broad mass of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">We often accuse people – our own citizens – of lacking the willingness and courage to take risks. If, though, the gaps in the social networks in our own countries become ever wider and let more people fall through, it is not surprising if people are often afraid – of risks as much as of anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the progressive undermining of services of general interest – an area in which we are still awaiting a coherent policy from the European Union, and especially from the Commission – often has the unfortunate effect of leading some people to blindly oppose globalisation, or, at any rate, to be suspicious of the common market. Here, too, I want to underline what you said. The European Union is indeed not a supermarket. We should be perfectly capable of combining the objectives of sustainable development with social market economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">My group does not see the desire for greater individuality, more flexibility, more mobility, more – to use a new expression – employability, as an antiquated concept. We will have succeeded when people throughout Europe have an appropriate social security network available to them. My group is firmly convinced that – even if only to avoid unfair competition – this network must also embrace those who have migrated here.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore affirm our commitment to a European model of capitalism, one that, in the long term, is more efficient, more social, and more humane.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by reiterating my warm welcome, and that of my group, for this paper. It is my belief, though, President Prodi, that, as you said in your speech, we need more conviction in matters of policy, as well as strategies that come to terms with the popular mindset, both in our own countries and among our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Do something, Mr President, to ensure that the Commission's documents clearly express the nature of the European project – that it is neither technocratic nor administrative, but political.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, at a time when the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe have been subject to quite a great deal of criticism from EU Heads of Governments, and from European Commissioners and others, for making their views on the Iraq crisis known, the ELDR Group strongly welcomes the statement from the European Commission that the central priority must and will remain enlargement. It is in our view absurd that so many criticisms have been made of candidate countries; they have been reprimanded in a condescending manner when the divisions that have opened up within the European Union in the current crisis are almost entirely of the making of the existing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course true that the European Union is not a supermarket, but equally it is not a temple in which people who speak a little too loudly are asked to remain quiet. The reasons why divisions have opened up are largely to do with insistence by existing Member States on a slavish allegiance to Washington, or an equally stubborn hostility to everything that emanates from the United States. The candidate countries are innocent bystanders in that debate and should not be penalised for having being pressured into making their views known.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we strongly welcome your emphasis, President Prodi, on making sure that these current problems do not in any way derail or slow down the enlargement process and hope that you will do everything possible to see the enlargement process through to its logical conclusion next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make is on the issue of governance. This document is a useful step forward in the improvement of EU governance and to that extent we welcome it warmly. It is crucial that governance is improved at an institutional level. There is no point in one institution or another raising its game if the other institutions do not reciprocate. That is why the ELDR Group is especially keen that the somewhat stalled talks in the interinstitutional working group, which is looking at the way in which we all collectively improve our law-making capacity, should conclude as quickly as possible. Deadlines have slipped; the group should have concluded its work at the end of last year and the new deadline for the spring summit also now seems unrealistic. It is essential that we all pull our weight in the three institutions concerned to make this institutional approach a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you an example. You cite at length in your document the very laudable attempts in the European Commission to apply impact assessments of a number of key legislative proposals. I think you are proposing to do that on 31 proposals in 2004. There would be no point in those impact assessments if MEPs in the European Parliament or Ministers in the Council of Ministers were then to ignore your assessment and simply revise the legislation without any regard for the impact. That is why many of us in the interinstitutional working group have been urging you in the European Commission to think about how you could extrapolate your excellent work in the impact assessment field and urge all institutions to sign up to similar practices. We would certainly urge you to redouble those efforts in the weeks ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Four months later, having read the long communication from the Commission and heard President Prodi, and speaking on behalf of the GUE/NGL, I would be tempted to say the same thing, except that today’s information document is far more watered down. It is a display of what I would term blind optimism. Worse still, I find it to be extremely dated and swamped with useless, obvious facts. For example, the mandate of the Prodi Commission ends in 2004; European elections will be held and 732 members will be elected; enlargement will take place on 1 May provided that the ratification process is complete.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, world peace is severely threatened and the UN is in danger of losing credibility. The Member States are divided between those that uphold peace and those that are in favour of war, between those that are blindly following the United States and those seeking a balanced European position. The economic crisis and the recession are worsening rapidly, unemployment is increasing everywhere with thousands of people the victims of harsh redundancies, insecurity in all its forms is flourishing to the detriment of the weakest and, in the face of these mortal challenges, the first two of which were raised by President Prodi this morning, the written communication discusses new forms of governance, stability, new social and economic agendas, quality of life, border security and even traffic and registration taxes for private vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the members of my group are not all pro-Europe, to say the least, but they are realists. The vast majority of them, given that Europe now exists, demand that it should at least be a people’s Europe, that it should be democratic, pay attention to social issues and not be subject to the diktats of the economy, in order to respond to the real problems of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to have to tell you, therefore, President Prodi, that not only do we disagree with the ideology that underpins your proposals but, what is worse, these proposals, even if we were to accept this ideology, are barely equal to the major issues we need to resolve. That, Mr President, is why, with all the respect that is due to you and that I have for you, I would ask you to review your document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the disappointment of my fellow Member Mr Elles with regard to the absence of the Council. Today we are discussing the<span class="bold"> </span>budget guidelines and the Commission policy strategy at the same time, as we hoped that a kind of synergy would arise between the two. That is very difficult, however, when<span class="bold"> </span>those policy intentions are tabled so late: too late to discuss them at length in the groups and also too late to compare them with the guidelines drawn up by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, my group believes that it is important to choose another moment this year for the Commission to clearly set out its specific priorities for the coming year; not a laundry list of good intentions, therefore, but political choices combined with a time schedule. Indeed, we have little time left in this legislative period. I take as an example the agreements concerning chemicals. These are supposed to be implemented in 2004, but there is a danger that a number of changes which have been agreed upon will be presented too late, which may mean that the procedure for these additional changes cannot be finalised before the end of this term. In that case, of course, there is no way we can make that 2004 implementation date, and my group is concerned about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In a different context, too, the motto of my group in recent months has always been ‘make law not war’. In our view, legal instruments and abiding by agreements are essential; especially in matters of human rights and democracy. We should like, therefore, to make further agreements on the clauses included in the treaties with third countries. Parliament must play a role in monitoring those agreements, and conclusions must also be drawn. How else is it possible to prevent those important clauses – to which the European Union also makes constant reference in order to indicate its support for human rights and democracy – becoming just empty words?</p>
<p class="contents">The equal treatment of men and women also touches the heart of the Union’s values. Last Saturday was 8 March – International Women's Day – and so I thought it fitting to say something about that here, too. The directives have been very influential in the emancipation of women and it is vital that they are complied with, including in the candidate countries. This is a part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> that has to be adopted without transitional periods. I expect the Commission to indicate whether, in its opinion, it has sufficient financial and administrative means for this. If not, this is another part that must be included in the budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to a point of an entirely different order. The report by Mrs Gill states – against her wishes, incidentally – that political parties have to be paid out of Parliament’s budget. This really leaves me dumbfounded. Have we not learnt anything from the report by the Court of Auditors, which said that there must be no interconnection between the groups and the political parties? In addition, this would make the line between donating money and buying votes a very fine one. Could it be that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats finds it convenient that the Council has no control over these funds, because in that case the Council, in accordance with the gentlemen’s agreement, will also not have any say as regards the funds for the political parties? In the view of my group, that is unacceptable. If, against our hopes, the amendment by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, advocating the inclusion of those funds in the general Commission budget, is not adopted, we shall unfortunately feel compelled to vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the economic and social climate is extremely tense, I am surprised by the optimism of the Commission communication and, to be frank, exasperated by this way of approaching debates. I could have written Paragraph 2 of the draft resolution on the state of the European economy which calls on European leaders at the next Spring Economic Affairs Council to avoid vague, self-satisfied speeches, and I would vote for it tomorrow. That, however, is the only part of this debate with which I agree.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rest is concerned, there is a vast gulf between, on the one hand, the Commission’s lyrical flights of oratory as regards the most competitive European economy, the knowledge-based<span class="bold"> </span>society, new governance and, on the other, the dashed hopes of growth and employment despite the repeated promises of the single market and the euro. It is shocking and cannot easily be explained. Perhaps Mr Prodi will be able to explain why the Commission is speaking this way when the analyses carried out by Eurostat and the OECD clearly paint a pessimistic picture. The government of my country has also, at last, accepted the facts, having shown excessive optimism for which, ironically, the Commission has not failed to criticise it. It is even more shocking to see that, faced with the facts, the Commission is persisting with enlargement and using all possible means to try to make the European Union attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">I found the advertisements that appeared in the Maltese daily newspapers, announcing the sum of aid the country will receive if it joins the Union, to be particularly inappropriate. I experienced the same unpleasant feeling on reading the following part of your strategy for 2004: ‘Against this background, this Commission wishes to leave the foundations for the success of the enlarged Europe. In this context, this Commission notes that 2004 will see the completion of the objectives that it set at the beginning of its mandate’. This passage reminds me of another extract from five years ago, which stated that the mandate of the Commission at that time had been characterised by progress in several fields in order to prepare for the future with the necessary confidence and resources. This passage merits consideration in view of what happened to the previous Commission and the political objective of transparent, effective management. It is up to you to prove to us that you are not taking the same path, and that will not leave us much time to police the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to the form: the very first paragraph states, and I quote: ‘The Annual Policy Strategy adopted by the Commission […] seeks to define the Commission's policy priorities and ensure that there is the right match between policy initiatives and the corresponding resources’. This phrase could give the wrong impression. It leads us to believe that the Commission is a government adopting its policy strategy. This is not the case: this communication is merely a proposal which must, one way or another, be adopted by the Council, which is the only body with the power, under Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, to provide the Union with its political impetus. I would also note that the Council is not present today, and I do not know what conclusion to draw from this absence.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the right priorities have been chosen, but it is possible to infer a difference in approach between the first, enlargement and the working of the European Union, and the second, border stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Union, including old and new Members, there is a kind of Community fundamentalism; in relations with neighbouring countries, however, flexibility and variable geometry allow the implementation of differentiated frameworks for cooperation. It seems to us that flexibility should be present in all cases. President Prodi has just repeated yet again that, in a Europe with 25 States, we would have to abolish unanimous decisions and generalise qualified majority voting. Our opinion is that qualified majority voting will not work either if we do not also accept the right of veto for national parliaments and variable geometry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the 2004 financial year will be an unusual one for several reasons. Firstly, our Budget will have to take into account the fact that, on 1 May of that year, ten new Member States will probably be joining us. For this to be possible, the financial perspective will have to be changed. Negotiations are still taking place on this subject, but, as far as Parliament is concerned, adoption of the acts of accession, and the figures they contain, should not automatically signify approval of the financial perspective. Further discussions will be needed on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has a very strong preference for a budget to be adopted in December of this year for 25 Member States. That means that we shall have to work on the basis of 15 Member States for the first part of 2004 and then, as of 1 May 2004, for the ten new Member States on top. The budgets will therefore have to contain certain remarks to make this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Another new element of the 2004 budget to which I hope Members will become accustomed is a new system called ‘activity-based budgeting’. As I have said, everyone will have to become accustomed to this. What are the priorities of the 2004 budget? First of all – and Mr Prodi has already said this – we have to see to it that the economies of the new Member States are integrated into those of the present Member States. We must promote economic activity and, to that end, we must first of all create better investment opportunities in those countries, and we must look into all the means to make that possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority of the budget is improving administrative capacity in those countries. How will they be able to cope with the enormous sums of money they receive and how can they see to it that good projects are submitted?</p>
<p class="contents">I now wish to say something about the various budget headings; starting with heading 1, agriculture. Everything will depend on the results of Commissioner Fischler’s mid-term review, but irrespective of this, we should like attention to be paid to a number of matters. First among these is the question as to the precise nature of the relationship between the payment of agricultural subsidies and European environmental guidelines. We shall have to determine this more precisely.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the question as to whether it will be possible to develop insurance schemes in the future for animal diseases. We are currently seeing avian influenza in the Netherlands, and we have seen foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever. We shall have to look into this. Furthermore, is it possible to take further action to promote the sale of agricultural products, especially high-quality agricultural products?</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding heading 2, structural funds, the main thing is that we have to do what we have promised. We have to see to it that the countries who have been told they may receive structural funds do actually receive these and that the administrative restrictions are not too restrictive. We shall have to investigate the consequences of the n+2 rule and the consequences of the 4% performance reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards heading 3, internal policy actions, a number of items under this heading have already been laid down. For the rest, we shall have to devote attention to what Europe can do in the field of combating terrorism – which is very topical at this time. What can be done better at European level than in the individual Member States? What can we do towards the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, towards better protection of the external borders and a better asylum policy? What can we do to improve nuclear safety in the new Member States? Lastly, I should like to raise another point: what can we do about the proliferation of agencies? It seems that every year yet more agencies are added. Is that not excessive? I should also like to raise a final point: what can we do about the ageing population of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">As always, heading 4 requires special attention, particularly at this time. What will be the consequences of any crisis in Iraq or a crisis in the Middle East? We shall be confronted by many more points, and we shall therefore have to keep a close eye on those.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning heading 5, administrative expenditure, we shall have to look carefully at the results of the Commission reform. We shall also have to see what the results of the extra allocation of officials have been which we have carried out in the past, et cetera.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the last point, heading 7, a decision was taken in Copenhagen to categorise aid to Turkey under heading 7, and the Commission agrees. The Council, however, has also said that we shall have to wait until 2004 to look at whether negotiations with Turkey can begin. We shall have to look at whether this heading will have to be renamed and whether we shall have to divide it up into different sub-headings, et cetera.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point – I can hear your hammer, Mr President – is that I am anticipating constructive cooperation with everyone in this Parliament, and especially with the many committees. Lastly, I shall also be paying special attention to the point raised by Mr Elles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, the 2004 other institutions budget, as Mr Mulder has said, will be the first one for the European Union composed of 25 Member States. Consequently, it is likely to be more complex than any other and I would therefore like to thank everyone at the outset for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">For me it is imperative that the European institutions are provided with the necessary means to complete their preparations, because enlargement must be visibly successful to the European citizen. Within this context, there are three main themes in my resolution. Firstly, to achieve greater accountability through improved presentation and transparency of the budget. I want to improve the quality of the spending, not just achieve the spending. There is a need for further development of the information on most important cost factors, to achieve greater effectiveness and sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">Real transparency will only really be evident externally to European citizens if we have it in the first instance internally. Our current system does not always lend itself readily to achieving this goal. Decision-making is too centralised and there is not enough devolution and delegation in management structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we are on transparency, one of the major new areas under consideration is funding for political parties. I am very disappointed that those on the other side of this House, who claim to be champions of transparency, are pushing for funding within Parliament's budget instead of the Commission's. Surely this will leave us open to allegations that we are looking after our own political interest. This budget line should remain with the Commission, which has the mechanisms for managing it objectively. The Commission is wrong to take a very short-term view and propose otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">My second main concern is that we connect and communicate more coherently with the people of Europe. We need to be more innovative and ambitious in almost every area of our operation, never more so than in our information and communication policies. When it comes to informatics, our website has to be seen more as a communication tool than just an information port.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has to play an even greater role in the interinstitutional communication strategy executed by the Commission. Furthermore, we need greater endeavours by everyone to ensure active citizenship and civic participation. It is therefore crucial that European citizens are better informed about the activities of Parliament and how European legislation can influence their daily lives. To achieve this we need to consider creating a European public media space.</p>
<p class="contents">My third theme is to create a flexible framework for the future operations of Parliament and other institutions. This is probably one of the greatest challenges for all the institutions and I welcome the 'raising the game' proposals put forward by Parliament's Secretary-General to improve the focus of our secretariat's activities and give greater legislative assistance to Members. It has to be said, though, that this is a fairly tame set of proposals. Within these proposals there is one for establishing a tabling office, which is definitely a step in the right direction. I know there are those who have reservations about this, but if we are honest with ourselves the number of mind-bogglingly trivial amendments that we have to deal with is astonishing. I would have welcomed greater ambition and innovation from the Secretary-General, but I recognise the limited appetite our institution has for reform and change.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I have been a rapporteur for only the last couple of months. However, I have discovered the process to be extremely instructive. I have found nooks and crannies in this House that I never knew existed. If I may beg your indulgence, I would like to share some of my initial impressions with you.</p>
<p class="contents">I have come across some amazingly talented, committed and hard-working people, but for every one of them there are two who just appear to float. It is remarkable that this House achieves what it does and continues to evolve, given the resistance in almost every structure. The culture I have come across throughout the institution seems to be extremely hostile to even a small amount of change and no sooner has an opinion been expressed than there are letters flying around objecting to it. There are few who have truly appreciated the full implications of enlargement. There is a belief that we can carry on doing things as we have up to now, but just do them ten times more.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of the new Member States have had to show extreme flexibility in moving from the old system to the new system. We in the institutions need to start showing similar flexibility if we are to enhance the credibility of our institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Enlargement will become a reality in 2004, and we in the institutions must do everything possible to ensure that it is a success from the very outset. The new Member States will participate from the day they join in all the programmes funded by the European Budget – programmes in agricultural policy, structural policy, environmental policy, the research programmes, and, to take another example, the programmes to promote trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the financial framework for the new Member States was negotiated in Copenhagen, the adjustment of the Financial Perspective has to be a decision taken jointly by the Council, Parliament and the Commission. That being so, it necessarily follows that Parliament has, as agreed, the right to examine the appropriateness of the proposal to the financial adjustment of the framework. I do hope, though, that we will be able to come to a joint resolution on the adjustment of the financial framework before the treaties are formally signed on the Agora in Athens. Speaking for the Commission, I can reiterate that we will of course give you every assistance in examining every option when it comes to framing a joint resolution on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004 there will be new programmes for the new Member States, for example the Schengen facility, which will be, for the first time, a sort of cofinancing arrangement, whereby the European Budget will fund the performance of tasks in fulfilment of the Schengen criteria. For the first time, too, there will be financial aid, for example for the decommissioning of atomic power stations. As the new Member States will also, however, have to transpose legislation on competition and the environment from day one, the Commission will also be asking the budgetary authority, as soon as this year, to authorise additional posts, and, as we will have to cope with a new linguistic diversity, half the posts required in 2004 will be reserved to the language services.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the other priorities for 2004 are the maintenance of political stability, and, as the President of the Commission was just saying, this has both an external and an internal dimension. As regards the external effects, this priority will find expression in the Budget by our proposal for an increase in funds for the Balkan region and also for the MEDA programme. The Commission also proposes that pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania – as promised to both those countries – should be increased in order to give both these countries more help towards achieving their goal of becoming Member States of the European Union in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also proposes that funds for Turkey should be substantially increased in order to support processes of reform and its preparations for accession to the European Union. The Commission will, in addition, be putting forward a new proposal for dealing with migration issues within the various policy areas. We will be proposing a new multiannual programme for this. Another priority is sustainable growth, which means that, for example, one of our proposals that needs to be improved is that on ways of combating marine pollution arising from tanker accidents, and we also need to build up resources for the fight against communicable diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">When I compare this list with what Mr Mulder said in his speech and with your report, on which I congratulate you, many of the priorities set for the 2004 Budget by Parliament and the Commission appear to be very similar. In so far as that is the case, I also hope that we will be able to bring the Budget procedure to a satisfactory conclusion. I also want to congratulate Mrs Gill on her report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use the time remaining to me to deal briefly with two questions that have been put. The first question has to do with the proposal for an instrument for the Budget lines in Chapter A-30. We will be putting such a proposal to Parliament at the end of April. As regards the second, on the funding of parties, what is crucial in the first place is that we at last achieve the breakthrough and enact a legal basis enabling this chapter to be concluded in such a way that there is a quite unambiguous legal base on which funds can be allocated to this from the European Budget. As regards the question of who, in view of the separation of the powers, is most competent to administer such funds, we will certainly still have the opportunity to debate this in greater depth.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, enlargement – an historic event – will be a reality. The President of the Commission has described how the Commission has decided to discharge its responsibility and submit proposals for the Union's tasks, and the financial resources they will require, in the period after 2006. The Commission has a very open mind as regards the arguments as to whether this proposal for the new Financial Perspective – that is to say, for the period after 2006 – should cover the period up to 2013 or 2011. I take the view that this is in fact a propitious time to shift to a five-year cycle. We are fortunate in that we will have the time to debate these matters together and determine the best framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal on the financial framework must be appropriate to the challenges that the future will bring, and, in financial terms, these will affect the issues Mr Mulder raised, of what we can do to really make Europe into an economy based on knowledge and the most competitive economy of all, of how much more we can contribute to this from the Budget, and of which programmes are required in order to do this. The expectations to which the President of the Commission referred – that is to say, the public's expectation that the European Union should contribute to their security – invite the question as to what, for example, that means for the European Budget. As the task of securing our borders is a matter of common interest, should it not find its expression in some sort of joint financing?</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will result in increased economic disparities within the European Union, and this will make particular demands on the funds we will be injecting as an expression of solidarity. These tasks will make it necessary for us to submit proposals. Even if, as a European Union, we want to play a greater role in foreign affairs, this will have to be set down in appropriate proposals on the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that our task will be to produce proposals for a Union consisting of twenty-five or twenty-seven Member States, and it stands to reason that any such proposals must represent an added value for the citizens of the European Union. I can already promise you that we will make use of the time available to us this year to work closely with Parliament in elaborating these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unfortunate that, this year again, I have to observe that we have still not progressed much further as regards the complete realisation of internal freedom of movement. It is for that reason that we urgently need the requisite funds to secure our borders and defend ourselves against the trafficking of human beings. We continue to need unambiguous common rules for legal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The reinforcement of Europol and Eurojust, along with the fight against terrorism, continue to be among the European Union's most urgent tasks. Our objective remains what it always has been – the creation of a common judicial area, by which means alone we will succeed in winning the public over to enlargement and convincing them of its advantages. It is with specific reference to enlargement that I want to draw attention today to the increasing cost of internal security in the European Union of the future. The EU will have to spend a good deal more money on both Eurodac and Eurojust if we want, for example, to achieve an equally high standard of protection on the new borders when the EU has enlarged to include twenty-five states.</p>
<p class="contents">Schengen, too, will, in future, result in further increases of expenditure for the EU, which will, as I have said, have a total of 25 Member States. What all this means is that the internal policy budget will have to be topped up if the European Union is to do justice to its objectives and tasks, and if the area of freedom, security and justice is not to have a merely theoretical existence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I appeal to my fellow Members to support the amendment we have tabled today on the guidelines for the 2004 Budget procedure and the amendments that will be brought in during the forthcoming debates on the Budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, I am pleased that Mr Mulder is a rapporteur this year. Whilst being a member of the Committee on Budgets, he is very well informed on agriculture, and, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should also like to express my confidence that we shall enjoy constructive cooperation with the Committee on Budgets and with this rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like to make a couple of main points with regard to the guidelines. To begin with, we note that a particular policy is starting to take shape with regard to animal diseases in Europe. Regarding the keeping of animals, the European Union has different legislation from other parts of the world, and our policy makes animals more vulnerable to disease. I note that, in the past, we have had outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever in the European Union, and now we have another outbreak of avian influenza. That means that we need a better policy and also need to develop better insurance systems in order to adequately combat precisely this sort of crisis, and, furthermore, must also set aside sufficient funds to enable livestock farmers and livestock farming to survive this kind of crisis. I therefore welcome the fact that Mr Mulder’s report includes what is necessary in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the shift in the sector towards greater market orientation. That means that we must do more for promotion, market orientation and the organisation of the financial policy in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the new Member States, in regard to which this is a historic budget. I refer to the report by Mr Xaver Mayer, in which he expressly asks that the Sapard funding be paid out in any case in the new Member States. If this should cause problems of a legislative nature, we shall have to try to find a satisfactory solution, but in any case, these funds must also be paid out in the new Member States in future, especially for the restructuring of agriculture and horticulture. It is also important that policy, especially with regard to food safety, the development of animal welfare, and environmental instruments in agriculture, be geared more towards the development of instruments for financial policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is also important that the European Commission strictly adheres to enforcing the principle of additionality through uniform verification methods. That is the view of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee of this Parliament. The committee believes that it is important to speed up the introduction of all the streamlining measures needed to improve the quality of Structural Fund spending in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If EU Structural Funds are going to be applied for the desired purpose, namely to improve the economic and social cohesion of different regions, then these monies must be spent as additional financial resources. If the principle of additionality is not rigorously enforced and independently verified, it makes it very difficult for European Union institutions and national EU governments to ensure that the competitive position of those regions most in need is improved. I welcome the introduction of activity-based budgeting, and the setting of clear and measurable objectives will greatly aid the budgetary process. We all agree that the EU budget must be framed in such a way as to meet its objectives. I am concerned that, whereas the rate of appropriations from the Community budget for trans-European networks in the field of transport measures continues to be at a satisfactory level, a number of Member States have failed to advance the necessary monies for these TENs projects.</p>
<p class="contents">On a broader budgetary matter, I welcome the fact that under the 2004 budget Parliament's Committee on Budgets supports the following measures: the need to increase rural development aid measures under the EU common agricultural policy; the need to guarantee the safety of food products, both from within the territories of the Union and from third countries; greater co-ordination of security measures at the EU's external borders and improved EU immigration and asylum policies; and promotion of an EU media space to disseminate information on the workings of the European Union and raise public awareness of the impact of European Union legislation on the day-to-day lives of the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to mention the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. Both of these committees come into very close contact with the individual European citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years the Petitions Committee has developed the possibility of inviting petitioners to attend committee meetings, where appropriate, to have their petition addressed. We need to ensure that there is adequate funding to enable citizens to do that, where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Petitioning Parliament is an essential right for the citizens of Europe. The Petitions Committee often offers the citizen a way of cutting through the bureaucracy of Europe to address issues affecting their lives. I am talking about only a very modest increase in the sums available, but this would send out a very big message to the European people.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that the Ombudsman is the other great defender of citizens' rights. According to Eurobarometer, 87% of citizens recognise their right to go to the European Ombudsman. We have just appointed a new Ombudsman. I have no personal interest in this, but we need to ensure that there is adequate funding for the Ombudsman to have the staff and resources to cope with the enlargement of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On culture – less than 0.5% of total expenditure – we must have an effective procedure for the A-30 lines. I heard what the Commissioner said earlier. I welcome that. Timing is critical in this. I hope that we will have the procedures in place so that bodies like the European Youth Orchestra and the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation know that their future is assured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My remarks are also addressed to the representatives of the Council although they do not appear to be present.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks are due to the rapporteur for his ideas and for the care he has taken to include most of the ideas expressed by others into the report. My group fully endorses the report. Indeed we support it so strongly that we have not tabled a single amendment to it in the House. We trust that only a limited number of the amendments tabled by other groups will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to a more contentious issue, as the rapporteur mentioned, the 2004 budgetary period will be unusual throughout. Initially, the budget will apply to 15 Member States. At the close of the period it will, however, apply to 25. This will call for an additional effort to reach understanding between the three institutions, whereas relations are currently somewhat strained.</p>
<p class="contents">Times are hard for Europe and even harder for the wider world. The 2004 budget should represent a statement of faith in ourselves. We should be confident of our potential and abilities as Europeans. Further, the 2004 budget should help to strengthen Europe’s role and influence beyond its borders. This is sorely needed as our common foreign policy, its instruments and even the individuals charged with operating them appear to have gone missing in advance of the action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe foreshadowed in the Mulder report is a united Europe. It is a Europe able to generate competitiveness and employment. It is also a Europe to be relied on by its partners in the wider world, and a Europe better able to manage its common policies. Interinstitutional cooperation is one of the prerequisites to such a Europe. Unfortunately it cannot currently be guaranteed. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of this very report state that enlargement financial perspectives are to be approved jointly by the Council and the European Parliament. This does not seem to be the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must have a considerable say regarding the financing of internal and external policy, if Europe is to prove a reliable partner, and if we are to become competitive and create employment. Global amounts for the adjustment of financial perspectives must not be set unilaterally. Parliament must be entitled to identify the shortfall in these areas and negotiate adequate sums.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is prepared to negotiate with the Council and the Commission concerning these areas. They are key to the achievement of the objectives identified by Mr Mulder. In the present climate of disunity and dissent, the Union’s institutions are called on to illustrate dialogue and cooperation, not to contribute to the unrest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, for the very good cooperation that we have already enjoyed over recent weeks. This is very early in the year to be setting down Budget lines, but the procedure has changed in such a way that we will always be doing this rather earlier in the future, which is not necessarily a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">If you see what discussions are going on at present in the European Union, you will know that, on the one hand, Europe is associated in the public mind with an enormous amount of hope, but that also, on the other hand, people are at present somewhat disconcerted by many aspects of it. The debates that we will be having this year, which will also have an influence on next year's Budget, will be on issues such as the Convention, enlargement, future economic progress, and the prospects for peace. It is also necessary that we, that Parliament, should be reliable in the work we do on the Budget, reliable as regards what we did in the past, and as regards what we want to carry forward into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Each individual issue has to be approached and discussed in a frank and transparent way. I have said in every Budget debate that we have to have equal rights in every area of the Budget, and I will stop saying this only when we actually are, and the Convention has a chance of making this happen and, in the Budget procedure too, even in matters of agricultural policy, of giving both parts of the budgetary authority equal powers. We have to ensure that transparency and clarity in matters concerning the European Budget are capable of being communicated to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the threshold of enlargement. We want enlargement. The division of the continent of Europe into West and East, poor and rich, is a falsehood, but preparations for enlargement must be transparent, and the rationale behind them must be comprehensible, even when it comes to financial matters. Parliament is one of the two component parts of the decision-making authority, and we will not allow the Council to present us with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span> in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Europe's economic development is concerned, many of those who have already spoken have said that we have to further develop the internal market – that internal market that many saw as pointing in the right direction and that raised their hopes; but unemployment in Europe is as much an issue now as ever it was. The means are available to us to do something about this. In recent years, we have refunded EUR 14 billion on one occasion, EUR 11 billion on another, and this year we will be refunding EUR 7 billion – resources that have not been used, in the Structural Funds for example, to combat unemployment. That is something we cannot accept. This tendency may have been alleviated somewhat, but it remains the case that far too much of the funds we have cannot be made use of. In order that we may make progress in this area, I ask you to take the simplification of administration further.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards peace – both around the world and on the continent of Europe – it is only natural that we should take our past actions as the basis for future development, but, as it strives to develop a common foreign and security policy, Europe must not be understood to consist only of those who are currently engaged in developing joint military structures. Our approach must be that of avoiding and preventing conflicts and of disarming, as we have done with such things as landmines, and, if I may turn to developments in Palestine and Iraq, we are of course prepared to provide humanitarian aid there at a later date, but let nobody regard this as a licence to do whatever is possible on the basis that they can do their bit, and reconstruction can be left to the European Union. We have to make it abundantly clear that we are not giving anybody carte blanche.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the final point that I want to address. Europe is undergoing demographic change – and this is where we have to look slightly further ahead – in that it has an every-increasing number of older people and ever fewer young people. At European level, that will have an effect on pensions. We want all policies to be considered from the point of view of what these changes will mean in the future …</p>

This is now the first year involving the activity-based budget, which will make it simpler for us all in future to interpret the political messages in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill for their constructive and well set-out discussion documents for the work on the 2004 budget. The objective of this year’s budget has been to unify Europe, for enlargement means that there is a need for a range of new initiatives. In this context, I would especially mention the need for the Commission’s reforms to be implemented in such a way that the administration becomes genuinely efficient and is made sufficiently flexible for it to be possible, once and for all, to straighten out those problems that led to the Commission’s departure in 1999. If we do not get the problems solved now, matters will become so much the more difficult in an enlarged EU. It may be argued that enlargement will provide special opportunities for sorting out a number of problems. On the other hand, the difficulties in solving them will also be exacerbated. As Mrs Gill mentioned, that also applies, of course, in relation to our own institution, Parliament, which will no doubt have to be persuaded to tidy up its administration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to set aside the necessary funds for the continued development of administration, training and social dialogue in the new Member States. That also applies to the budgets for the agencies in the spheres of training and the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I wish to make is that, upon enlargement, the EU will acquire new borders in the east. In the budget, aid to the former Soviet bloc countries is to be provided through the Tacis programmes which provide money for administrative development, training and the promotion of safety in connection with nuclear power stations. It is important for Tacis to continue to ensure that the projects are properly implemented. Nuclear safety, in particular, is a high political priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that, in this budget process, we can also welcome our future fellow MEPs from the new Member States. I think that, with their more detailed knowledge of our new neighbours, they will have some good ideas as to how, in the future, we can generally develop the Tacis programmes and also ensure that they are efficiently implemented. That is a strand of the debate and of the budget to which I am very much looking forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There the proposed amendments to the Praesidium’s draft constitution are not translated into the official languages of the EU. The discussions held by the Convention’s working groups have only been interpreted into two or three languages. A constitution is being drafted, however, which is at a higher level than the Member States’ national legislation. As the Convention is called the Convention on the Future, language restrictions and the destruction of national linguistic identities would seem to be the future of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Both budget reports give attention to language, translation and interpreting. When Mrs Gill speaks of controlled multilingualism I am not sure that that means equality for all languages. When distance interpreting is mentioned, I am not sure that that means distance interpreting for all languages. If not all languages in the EU are to be used equally, let us draw lots for those languages that are to be the so-called working languages. Another linguistic outrage is the fact that the European Parliament visitor’s service no longer has a Finnish-speaking official.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, the guidelines for the budgetary procedure are on such a general level that there are only a few general remarks to make. Parliament’s unanimous political will would seem to be that there should be a determination to reduce the amount of unpaid payment appropriations, or RALs. Many in our group oppose the introduction of financial support for Europarties, as the parties would then become supranational.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Wynn’s report, which is the next to be discussed, some amendments to it have been tabled calling for the introduction of ‘Eurotaxes’ to finance the work of the EU. These supranational taxes are unacceptable to many in our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, the defining of a strategy for the coming year provides us with an excellent opportunity to set priorities. In its policy strategy for 2004, the Commission chooses the accession of ten new Member States to the EU first of all, followed by stability, and lastly sustainable growth. We can endorse this choice of political priorities. The accession of ten new Member States has been an important theme throughout the term of office of this Commission, and it is right that it be given top priority in 2004. After all, by 1 May of next year enlargement from 15 to 25 Member States will be a reality; provided, of course, that the populations of the candidate countries agree to this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s elaboration of the theme of ‘sustainable growth and solidarity’ it strikes one that, in the opinion of the Commission, the Union bears a very large number of responsibilities, namely: a) strengthening economic and social cohesion, b) tackling the uneven level of development between the various regions, c) supporting sustainable economic and social development and d) promoting balanced and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">This optimism about one authority single-handedly bringing about social change does not square with our view of the matter. The Commission should adopt a more modest attitude in this regard and should not take on so many tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that making stability a priority was the right choice. After all, we need to take the global terrorist threat most seriously. The elaboration of this policy area in concrete terms, however, is once again at odds with our idea of security and stability in Europe. The most important partner in the global fight against terrorism and in maintaining international stability is missing from beside what is known as the ‘new neighbours initiative’, or ‘ring of friends’ policy. I am talking about the NATO alliance, with the United States of America as a strong ally. Is the Commission prepared to define its position on this matter?</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the European Union’s multi-annual perspective for the period 2004–2006 that it really shows its true colours: this perspective talks of the fundamental tasks not only of ‘European citizenship’ and the solidarity mentioned above, but also of ‘enabling the Union to exercise the responsibilities of a world power’.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the current situation, it is Utopian to think of the deeply divided European Union playing a more active role in the maintenance of security in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations are due to Mr Mulder for his commendable report on the guidelines for the 2004 budgetary procedure. Unfortunately, I cannot talk in such positive terms about the report by Mrs Gill. The advantages she envisages in the draft statute for European political parties completely escape us. The Commission wants to get no less than 75% of the budget for these European parties out of the EU budget! Is that not completely out of proportion?</p>
<p class="contents">Political parties are free associations of citizens. Is it not logical, then, for citizens, who form the basis of every party, to give financial support to the party of their choice? This also respects the natural link between parties and their support base, which can only be beneficial to their involvement in politics. National political parties that wish to associate at European level should pay for that themselves – that is to say, their members should. European political parties are by definition much further removed from the bed of our citizens than national parties. If, therefore, we give those European parties an enormous subsidy from Community funds, we increase the gap between citizen and politics.</p>
<p class="contents">We find completely incredible Mrs Gill’s analysis that a propaganda offensive would bring the parties closer to the citizen. What visible effect have European campaigns about European citizenship or the benefits of the euro produced? The answer is none, so why should that succeed now? In the opinion of our group, it would be better to get the draft statute off the table as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, on political party funding – the matter just raised by Mr van Dam – my Group considers that this funding should be in Parliament's, <span class="italic">not</span> the Commission's budget. The reason is that we can be accountable: the rules are already set down and agreed between the three institutions. I understood that there was also a move by the Council of Ministers and the Commission to move this budget towards Parliament's financing. It is right and appropriate to show that we are responsible and accountable. An amendment has been tabled and I urge Members to vote – perhaps against their own groups – for Parliament to have control of the political party funding budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on buildings, the Bureau has made too many decisions without referring back to the appropriate committee – the Committee on Budgets. I welcome Paragraph 40 of the Mrs Gill's report, which I broadly support. That calls on the Secretary-General to submit a report by 1 June 2004 outlining 'the functional justifications for the new building projects'. I hope that report will include the proposals for two new conference rooms here. The United Kingdom Conservatives and Socialists are opposed to those two conference rooms, as they would spoil the very pleasant entrance to the European Parliament by the flags. There is no functional justification. The conference rooms – in particular the large ones – are under-utilised. There is more than enough room, even with the enlargement countries, to provide all the necessary facilities. That is a very important matter and, in future, we at least will be requiring functional justification before spending is approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw attention to a very positive amendment – of which I am sure Mrs Gill will approve – to Paragraph 28. This clarifies the movement towards more facilities to cover multilingualism, which is particularly important for enlargement. It concerns electronic guidance, computer workstations and directions to rooms. I know that as a new Member three years ago I had great difficulty in Brussels and Strasbourg even in finding rooms. Think of the language difficulties for Members from the new countries. Therefore, monitors and permanently-installed signs scrolling through the various languages would be a very important addition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a reference in the report to the Court of Auditors. It does very important work and needs extra resources, a suggestion I fully endorse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are four main European policies which will contribute to enlargement: cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy, the TENs policy and the policy for cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises. The success of enlargement and integration will depend to a large extent on the way these policies are revised and the importance given to them in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There are just two things I want to say. Firstly, I believe that we need to reconsider the funding allocated to the TENs and the Union’s contribution, simplify the procedures and reinvigorate the North-South dimension as well as the East-West dimension. Secondly, I believe we need to increase the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and their ability to form partnerships with the small and medium-sized enterprises of the candidate countries. To this end, it would be beneficial to enhance the current instruments and the current pilot project on enlargement and SMEs and take the opportunity afforded by the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 to give a clear boost to the measures facilitating the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My special thanks, however, go to the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, for the important work he has done so far in building the European Union and bringing nations closer to one another in a joint project that we now call enlargement to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget before us will be the first to be drafted for a Community of 25 Member States. This is a very challenging undertaking technically speaking, as the budget will apply to 15 Member States for the first four months and 25 Member States for the rest of the year. For this reason the important role of the rapporteurs in drafting this budget must be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, we have activity-based budgeting, which is now being implemented in earnest for the first time. It will improve the transparency of the budget and give a better picture of the work that is done within the framework of the European Union. Activity-based budgeting provides a straight answer to the question of what each activity actually costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Eastward enlargement is a challenge for everyone, and has to be taken into consideration throughout the entire budget preparation process. That starts with administration. We must continue to have respect for the individual languages of the Member States and hold multilingualism in esteem. The greatest challenge, however, concerns the Structural Funds. Enlargement to the east will be an enormous rebuilding project, the largest that Western Europe has embarked on since the Second World War. For it to succeed, the administration of the Structural Funds must be simplified and dealt with more efficiently. Only in this way can the results we are striving for be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst the importance of this issue is not to be denied, I do, however, have my doubts as to whether these Budget lines will actually enable the Commission to handle these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">My real concern is with the fact that, in connection with enlargement, provision has been made for expenditure of some EUR 11 billion in 2004, which amounts to only 10% of the total commitment appropriations. In agricultural expenditure, the proportion is as low as 2.4%. These proportions are hardly likely to guarantee the Member States participation on an equal basis, even when it is borne in mind that accession will happen as late as 1 May, so what I expect of the Commission is that they should set out in detail in the preliminary draft Budget what legal entitlements the new Member States will have to participation in all programmes funded from the EU Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Funds for the structural measures are very extensive – for this too, sensible advance plans were made in former years – but what is not working is the outflow of resources. What I expect is that the Commission will not delay long in producing precise figures and an analysis of why this is so and of the obstructions involved. There is a need here for greater confidence in the system's fairness, for not one euro of structural support funding must be wasted. For many citizens in the European Union's regions, the projects that depend on such funds are often the last fragile hope for the maintenance of their jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, today, the starting pistol has been fired, and the process of drawing up the preliminary draft of the 2004 general Budget can begin; there are important debates before us, and important work remains to be done. I therefore expect absolute transparency of the whole procedure, coupled with wide-ranging public relations work, which cannot fail to improve the public's perception of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Prodi was bound to speak of the crisis over Iraq, enlargement and the strategic need for a political project for an enlarged Union. He also referred to the in-depth assessment of ourselves and our role in the world currently under way in the Convention preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference. A number of other issues were mentioned such as the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice and, more directly relevant to the budget, the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation on 1 January.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on foreign policy. Clearly, the Union needs an effective, transparent and visible foreign policy. It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to give some indication of how the policy on decentralisation has evolved. An update on abnormal outstanding payment commitments would also be helpful. Parliament has been concerned about both these issues for some time now.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, serious thought should be given to heading 4 on foreign policy. We have been making do and mending for years. We are, however, likely to be called on to take urgent decisions on Iraq. We need to deal with Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Balkans and Mediterranean policy too. In addition I believe it is essential for us to review our transatlantic relations. They are bound to be affected following the conflict with Iraq. Last but not least, Commissioner, we should tackle the matter of relations with Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to be consistent as it presents this year’s draft budget proposals. It must honour the undertakings given at the Madrid Summit. Additional priorities cannot be financed out of the same resources. For instance, the Commission is adjusting the system of generalised preferences for countries such as Colombia or Costa Rica, and the Commission is not expected to suggest further budgetary cuts in the draft proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I urge you to bear these considerations in mind. In my view, if we wish to develop an ambitious foreign policy we must consider how to make available the necessary resources to move forward in the context of foreign policy and defence policy. If we do not do so I believe we shall continue to be excluded from negotiating tables and be reduced to bankrolling major international events. We will never be involved in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Prodi on the vision he has shown on opening this debate on strategic priorities. The debate should be linked to the debate on budget guidelines for 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The accession of the new Member States, whose GDP is below the Community average and whose needs are greater, will also cause severe problems. The European Union 2004 budget guidelines are all about cutting spending on the structural funds and the common agricultural policy and funding the repressive, aggressive common European defence and security policy, using the fight against terrorism and immigration, crisis management and conflict prevention as an excuse. In other words, agricultural spending is to be slashed in line with the WTO approach and under pressure from the USA, and this will be compounded by mandatory restructuring and an anti-farming slant to the partial reform of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">All this does is to prove that the budget is still an anti-grass roots budget and that the sacrifices imposed on the workers in the interests of the monopolies are continuing, in the Lisbon vein now, with increased exploitation, attacks on workers’ employment and insurance rights, galloping unemployment, environmental disasters and even greater commercialisation of health, education and social services.</p>
<p class="contents">The workers, the poor and lower middle classes of urban and rural society, are again being called on to pick up the bill for the recession, so that big business can keep raking in the profits. The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are opposed to these budget guidelines because, instead of resolving the problems of workers, farmers and small enterprises, they will create new ones and the standard of living of people in the candidate countries will fall. Instead of helping to maintain peace, the budget is being used to fund more militarisation and aggression on the part of the European Union and its anti-democratic, anti-grass roots philosophy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Traditionally, in the Member States, foreign policy is a matter for governments, but the parliaments are involved via the budget procedure, which enables them to influence foreign policy and the government's setting of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As there is something of a lack at European level of any counterpart to this sort of democratic control, we welcome the attention given by the Convention to a wider range of options for Parliament to exert influence on fundamental issues of finance for foreign policy concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we welcome the fact that it was possible, in the course of the 2003 Budget procedure, to come to an agreement with the Council on information concerning measures in the area of foreign and security policy. For the Council to take significant steps to accede to Parliament's wishes is a new thing, and although it did not, initially, keep to the undertaking it had given during the Budget procedure, information on our activities in Macedonia has now found its way onto the table. The most recent consultation with the Council made it possible for this to be guaranteed, and I see this as having been a step in the right direction. Such cooperation between the Council and Parliament is a foundation for our future endeavours. It is for this reason that we consider particularly important the passage in the guidelines in which Parliament lays renewed emphasis on its willingness to work together with the Council on the common foreign and security policy, and on its own insistence on its involvement to the fullest possible extent in budgeting for joint actions, planning them and taking decisions concerning them. We have had problems with this in the past, in that financial undertakings given by the Council meant that Parliament ended up being obliged to provide the funds from the Budget. That can be changed if Parliament is informed and involved in good time. If that happens, I think these Budget guidelines may well usher in a new stage in cooperation between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of foreign policy, let me make another observation concerning the ad hoc group that we have now set up to examine direct payments to the Palestinian National Authority. I think this ad hoc group gives us a good opportunity to cooperate with the Commission in seeing exactly what has been done with European taxpayers' money. We decided not to set up a committee of investigation, which would amount to laying charges at the outset, whereas we simply want to know how this direct aid worked and how we can organise it better in the future. This working group is about to start work. This is not so much a problem between Parliament and the Council as one between Parliament and the Commission, and we hope that, in the working group, the Commission will keep to its promise and be willing to work together with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first would be to exaggerate our differences, while the second would be to consider them negligible.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to establish a Community foreign policy, if we are to provide this enlarged Union with the means to defend its values, we must not be afraid of debate and, if we may, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps for the first time at this stage, let us discuss the financial resources that we will have to agree to release for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for a report on the new architecture of the European security and defence policy, which will be voted on in committee at the end of this month, I welcome the opportunity to introduce this subject without further delay, just as I welcomed the information and signals received over the past few weeks, both from the Commission and from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Council, first of all, at its meeting of 27 January last, the General Affairs Council, in deciding to take charge of the military operation in Macedonia, simultaneously decided to establish an operational financial mechanism designed to cover the share of related spending that will have to be cofunded by the European Union. This initiative is entirely new and will certainly begin to give some credibility to the stated objectives, which you have just recalled so clearly, President Prodi. We must now hope that this instrument, which was swiftly drawn up in accordance with Parliament, can be extended to all future EU operations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Commission, I was equally interested to note the account of the recent meeting between you, President Prodi, and the Greek Defence Minister, Giannos Papantoniou, who apparently suggested including a new heading to fund research into defence within the EU budget. That is precisely one of the new proposals that should certainly be endorsed in a few days by a majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Might I ask you, President Prodi, what your own reaction was to this proposal and when you think it could start to be implemented?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Madam President, President Prodi, unless the Union provides itself with the necessary institutional, operational and financial means, it will be doomed to remain on the sidelines of the international playing field for a long time. I am sure that this is not what the majority of our fellow European citizens want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The questions with which we are faced are of course important ones, and, right now, I want to say one thing in very clear terms: Commissioner, it would be a very great help to us if we did not have to concern ourselves solely with questions that will become relevant after your term of office has expired, such as how we are to proceed after 2006, and what we can expect to face then. What we have to deal with, quite specifically, is how the Financial Perspective is to be adjusted to take account of enlargement. I would have been glad if the Commission could have taken a line more openly sympathetic to Parliament in order to secure Parliament's rights, and hence the public interest in the transparency and openness of this process. We could certainly have done with more explicit statements in this area. Let me just say now, in very clear terms, that we will have to consider whether we will be in a position, a month from now, to deal with the applications for accession in this House, or whether we perhaps ought first to resolve the institutional question of how Parliament is to be involved in dealing with this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">What I actually wanted to do now was to say something to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, who are now conspicuous by their absence and do not think it necessary to send someone to represent them in this debate – and that itself speaks volumes! Now that we are discussing enlargement and preparing to welcome to our Parliament observers from the candidate states in only a few weeks' time, we should certainly be giving thought to other options for cooperation – Mr Dover made that point very impressively, and I am very grateful to him for doing so – in order to grow together in a more organised way in our day-to-day work and daily life. I think it is a pitiable thing for the Greens to table amendments aimed at deleting these passages from Mrs Gill's report. That is the very opposite of what we need if we want to accommodate over a hundred new Members in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">So now, Commissioner, here comes my request that we should now be concentrating on the matters in hand! I have mentioned the subject of the Financial Perspective, so let me remind you of the Andreasen case. I have here an internal memorandum from the Commission, which reaches an assessment different from that which you set out in the Committee on Budgetary Control. Now, at long last, we have to sort out the problem with the accounting systems. One of this Commission's great promises was that this parliamentary term would see things getting moved forward. When we have worked through all these things properly, then we will be able to talk about the prospects for the EU finances after 2006, but right now there are other things on the agenda, and they have to be sorted out as a matter of urgency if all the things promised since the day the Prodi Commission took office are to be finished by the time its term of office comes to an end. If we manage that, we will have achieved much for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are firstly, the potential level of expenditure, secondly, improved implementation, and thirdly, strategic options for expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the level of expenditure, the Union’s budget currently represents 1.02 % of gross Community income, and is at its lowest level. The present perspectives would allow an additional 5 000 billion. The same level of expenditure is planned for the 2004 budget. We are therefore operating in austerity mode, which should please the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Sound implementation is crucial for the 2004 budget. Payment take up has been well below that forecast during the last three years. The total surplus for those three years amounts to some 23 000 billion. Last year’s declaration on implementation profiles and the plan to do away with the abnormal RAL must therefore be followed through.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning priorities, I am sure Mr Mulder’s report is on the right lines. It takes account of two key issues, namely the concerns and expectations of the citizens on the one hand, and on the other, the conditions needed to allow the budgetary authority to reach a consensual decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2004 budget is crucial and represents a new departure for the Union. There are a number of reasons why this is so. The citizens understand that their security, freedom and prosperity demand appropriate budgetary decisions and common instruments. External border controls, the fight against organised crime and terrorism demand increased capacity for Europol and Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the promotion of business activity is crucial to the success of an enlarged Union. Many issues are still outstanding. I refer for example to the potential financial implications of agricultural reform or of the adoption of the adjustment of the financial perspectives. I have to say that I am amazed the Council is not represented in the House today. Nonetheless, the Council must realise that there is only one way of dealing with the challenges before us, and that is by reaching agreement with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been said, 2004 will be the year of the European Union's enlargement, but it must also be a year in which, at last, the European Union's foreign and security policy is developed further. So the crucial question is what democratic control there will be when we get a common defence policy. In this area, democratic control is exercised primarily by way of the Budget procedure. If we are to have to handle issues of war and peace in the same way as issues of foreign and security policy, such democratic control is even more important than in other areas. It is in view of the Convention that we need to make certain demands now, demands that will be significant in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, we have to ensure that the military element of operational expenditure on peacekeeping and crisis management has a fixed place in the European Union's regular Budget and that we in Parliament get full powers of codecision. Secondly, President Prodi, you said that joint actions were being undertaken in the European Union in the area of research and development, and in the purchase of armaments. We know that the Convention is talking in terms of an armaments agency, and we must do all in our power to ensure that these Budget lines do not disappear into a shadow budget somewhere, a budget over which neither the European Parliament nor the twenty-five national parliaments will have any control, but rather that these items of expenditure are reflected in the regular Budget of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union budget must therefore, now more than ever, contribute to achieving social and regional cohesion, both in the new States and in the current 15 Member States</p>
<p class="contents">I support the fact that the priorities selected for this 2004 budget are the completion of the internal market, the strategy for sustainable development, and achieving the Lisbon strategy, in the aim of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. This is, in fact, one of the major challenges facing the European Union, and which stand out because they have immediate and practical implications for every European citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice which, despite all the criticism it has rightly generated, has at least one virtue: it has increased the number of policies covered by the codecision procedure, thereby giving the European Parliament greater power to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, and because the situation is not entirely rosy, I should like to make some criticisms of the European Commission document that has been presented to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I agree with the rapporteur on the need to insist that the European Commission makes increasing rural development aid under the CAP its priority guideline. This is precisely the area in which the greatest disparities between Member States can be seen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I urge the Commission to step up the process of streamlining and improving the implementation of the budget, especially in its structural funds policy. In this context, I support the implementation of more reliable payment provisions, and the European Parliament being better informed about the level of payments underway, by programme, in order to respond to the risks of payments being cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically in the context of the cancellation of funds, it is my view that Rule N+2, which forces Member States to use funds within two years of their being programmed must be seen as an incentive for the rapid use of funds, without, however, compromising the quality of the expenditure undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the structural funds, I should also like to take this opportunity to draw the Commission’s attention to a problem of which it has already been made aware: the accession of the new Member States will have the statistical effect of reducing the European Union’s average GDP. Consequently, some regions’ levels will increase, with major risks of losing structural funds because they exceed the minimum levels that would entitle them to Community aid. I wish to emphasise that this, as in fact the Commissioner for enlargement himself, Günter Verheugen, has said, constitutes wealth on paper, but not in reality. Statistical indicators alone cannot justify terminating a cohesion policy for the current Member States. It is entirely in the European Union’s interest to see its current Member States enjoy high rates of growth, more employment and more opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such an assumption is not only fatal, but also false. It is even more important, in times of economic upheaval and renewal, for us to affirm and create social cohesion in order, among other things, to stabilise democracy and gain public acceptance in these new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like, then, to highlight four points from the debate that were of particular importance to us. In this context, the first is support for the social dialogue. In practically all the candidate countries there is still the need to establish and reinforce structures that will make the social dialogue a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the need to improve conditions in the workplace. Our work in the Member States treats health and safety at work as a priority, and the same must be true in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stressed our desire to have greater support, in every case, for the social platform as part of the action programme against social exclusion and discrimination. I would refer you to the Lisbon resolution in which we highlighted competitiveness and employment opportunities and stressed the need for them. In the candidate countries, restructuring affects not only agriculture, but still also major, and outdated, sectors of industry. They need our help with that, help that we can – and should – provide by means of European Union funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these areas, we rely, of course, on the knowledge of the agencies. We therefore expect them to receive the financial appropriations that they need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like briefly to respond to some of the questions, which are extremely interesting. It is a pity that the majority of the Members are absent. This should be a dialogue. However, I am glad to see that Mr Elles is here, and so I will address my answers primarily to him, for he has asked a number of key questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, he raised the issue of whether this perspective is just for five years or whether it is for seven years. We are not in a position to decide, and so we have kept our options open. I personally am in favour of a five-year perspective, both because that would synchronise it with Parliament’s work and because I feel that a seven-year perspective would be too long, that it would make control too difficult and extend beyond our powers of farsightedness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Elles also raised the issue of the number of Commissioners. The problem is not the number of Commissioners but the authority to organise and take decisions accorded to the President. Whatever the number of Commissioners, the question is how to organise the Commission’s work. It can be managed well with a small number of Commissioners or it can be managed well with a large number of Commissioners. Then, as regards the staff and the translation service, we have made veritable Herculean efforts and restricted the number of new staff to be employed to cope with enlargement to the bare minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Elles raised a number of other points which I feel it is important to discuss. For instance, he pointed out possible shortcomings in the chapter on external relations, particularly as regards the transatlantic partnership. I mentioned one of the two errors to be avoided right at the beginning of my speech, that of failing to understand the importance of the transatlantic partnership, and I did so precisely because I consider it to be crucial. Indeed, the ‘peace group’ set up by Commissioner Lamy is concerned with this too. More specifically, there are two major dimensions of external relations – the regional dimension – ‘Wider Europe’, the project we are approving today – and the international dimension, which essentially and primarily covers transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforming the Commission has been a priority right from the beginning and, starting in 2004, we will have completely new Staff Regulations. It has been a huge undertaking. We have a qualification process which covers all the institutions, today we are discussing the annual policy strategy, we have completely transformed the Commission’s financial management and we have a new management system giving much greater powers and responsibilities – this is vitally important for our future – to our officials, we also have a new control system and we are working on precisely the new accounting system, as you are aware, Mr Elles. Seeing as you mentioned the letter, now that I know of its existence I can assure you it will be published immediately, for these things must be made public. In any case, however, we must realise that, should a disciplinary procedure be necessary, all the rights of those involved in the procedure must be respected. In any case – I would stress – the letter must be made public without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the famous requests still outstanding are concerned, I will look into it. I will do everything possible and more, employing all available resources to look into it as quickly as possible. I must say, however, that the fact that 400 requests – as you said , Mr Elles – have yet to be addressed, might mean that too many requests have been made. I take the blame for the delay in producing some replies, but I believe we have a barrage of extremely important questions to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to focus on the point raised by Mr Clegg concerning better regulation, for it is related to these issues. An agreement is imminent, but I must say that my impression is that Parliament is taking less interest in the matter today than it did some time ago. I would like to take this opportunity to call for a last spurt so that an agreement can be achieved<span class="bold"> </span>during the interinstitutional summit on 19 March. I formally urge the Presidency of Parliament to make the most of this opportunity and to be prepared for a political conclusion next week. The Commission, for its part, is genuinely ready for this.</p>
<p class="contents">General Morillon asked for information on the budget heading and research related to defence. We are exploring the possibility of financing military research outside the Sixth Framework Programme for research but we do not yet have a definitive answer on this matter. I have pointed out the need for a debate – it would be useful to discuss the issue and we will submit solutions as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My final points are in response to the questions raised by Mr Swoboda, in other words what he described as the imprecise debate on objectives, on the Balkans and the Mediterranean. The Commission has presented – and it is supplementing that material today – an extremely precise plan with a clear policy which treats the Balkans as part of Europe. They will be Members of the Union, but they will be subject to the same strict conditions which have applied to the countries of this first phase of enlargement. There are no discounts. The door will be open when they approach it, but they will only be allowed to come in when they are ready. There is absolutely no leeway on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what Mr Swoboda said regarding the issue of the visa policy – which he described as stupid – not because we do not need to be rigorous in protecting the Union’s borders but because I genuinely feel that it is a policy which is in need of a complete overhaul. Indeed, in many cases, criminals have no trouble at all obtaining visas whereas, for normal citizens, this is often a tedious process<span class="bold"> </span>which is not matched by greater controls, and I am saying this precisely because I have seen how the visa policy is applied in practice. What we need is not, I would stress, to reduce the protection of our borders but, on the contrary, to increase it and make it more effective and focused.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Caudron’s last point: the Commission displays unwarranted optimism in its report. We are in an extremely difficult situation in which everything is falling apart. I want to make it quite clear that we are fully aware of the difficulty of the situation, of the tragic events taking place, but we are also aware of the huge importance of maintaining a balanced approach which takes all the factors into account, of the need to give maximum consideration to the work of the United Nations, of the fact that the new strategy genuinely calls for stronger, universally supported international institutions, with regard to which Europe’s role is indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there may well be an extremely serious crisis in the coming weeks, but I am deeply convinced that this very crisis will reveal the indispensable role of the European institutions. Europe alone has succeeded in uniting with peace as its top priority, introducing and implementing a new concept of national interest and relating it to the common interest, behaving towards the countries which support it with openness and displaying, I would say, a new insight into world relations and issues. This cannot go unnoticed. Clearly, at a time of crisis such as this, people are not paying as much heed to us as we might like, but we know that we are sowing seeds for the future.</p>
