<p class="contents">The United Nations, through its office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has this year established an information system in Sierra Leone, aimed at gathering information from women and girls in camps for internally displaced persons across the country, to determine the scope of sexual violence against women and girls. The data gathered will be used to advocate better protection and programming on the ground. Where appropriate the information may also be shared with the Truth and Reconciliation Committee being set up by the government and the proposed UN special court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, through ECHO, has been assisting the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights since September 2000, with a grant of EUR 30 000. This is intended to increase general awareness not only within government but throughout society as a whole, of the question of human rights in Sierra Leone and, in particular, the problem of violence against women and children. Funding to the tune of EUR 50 000 is being provided for training courses for humanitarian workers on human rights and international humanitarian law, including acts of violence against women. The human rights section of the UN peacekeeping force is implementing this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does he accept that the government of Sierra Leone needs substantial support from the international community, particularly the EU, to include – amongst what he has said – training for the army, the police force, prosecutors, judges and other law enforcement officials involved in human rights observance? Should the UNAMSIL forces be strengthened with equipment and other logistics to provide security for civilians, especially women and children?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, perhaps you could respond to the related, but different, issue of the alarming reports of the sexual abuse of nuns by priests in 23 countries, especially in Africa, including Sierra Leone, and the hopelessly inadequate response over a long period by the Vatican.

The emphasis of ECHO intervention in the northern Caucasus region, where the large majority of Chechen IDPs are located, is because this is where the biggest problem is. Up to 360 000 internally displaced persons in Ossetia, Daghestan and Chechnya itself, compared with a figure reportedly around 5 000 to 7 000 refugees in the Pankisi Valley in Georgia. Operating conditions in the northern Caucasus remain difficult, especially in terms of security. However, the same holds true for Georgia, where aids to the Chechen refugees in the Pankisi Valley had to be suspended for some time last year in reaction to the abduction of expatriate aid workers.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, allocations made in the context of the Chechnya crisis and benefiting Chechen refugees in Georgia total some EUR 820 000. The operations funded focus mostly on basic health care. They have, for instance, consisted of the distribution of essential medicines to health providers, training of doctors on rational drug use, rehabilitation of basic health care facilities and the distribution of hygiene parcels.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the scope of the case-load of internally displaced persons in the northern Caucasus and the limited resources available, ECHO's main focus for humanitarian intervention in favour of the victims of the conflict will remain there. However, depending on how the situation develops, some limited funding might be made available to continue a medical programme in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">No specific humanitarian assistance is envisaged for Azerbaijan as at present no substantial numbers of refugees from Chechnya are reported in Azerbaijan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall not comment on these cases which are <span class="italic">sub judice</span>, but I believe that it is worthwhile to explain the Commission’s policy on this issue which includes the problem of action to take against communicable diseases affecting developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue was referred to us last summer and we have worked on this, whilst trying to be both ambitious and fair. In September, we organised an international round table in Brussels, out of which came a number of recommendations, ranging from a diagnosis according to which the issue of access to key drugs involves both local systems for care provision, policies for prevention and, of course, questions of the pricing and thus the funding of medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">We came up with a global approach based on three pillars. The first is to step up our measures in this area, on the basis of development policy; the second is to lower the price of key drugs and the final pillar is to continue with high level research so that public research can be carried out alongside private research in this area. We very recently began a specific action programme based on this approach which forms part of a whole raft of actions adopted by the WHO, the UN and UNICEF, the ONPI and the WTO. I believe that we are now already seeing some of the first real effects with a number of pharmaceutical companies announcing that they are committed to lowering prices.</p>
<p class="contents">What part does intellectual property play in this matter? In our view, it has a major part to play, as intellectual property is required in order to stimulate both innovation and research. This is the role of TRIPS, which is the WTO agreement on intellectual property and today we clearly stated that we are defending this concept. However, we also stated and we are stating this just as clearly, that there are cases where exemptions from patent law – which is called compulsory licensing – are permitted for public health or urgent health reasons. We would like to reiterate that the WTO agreement on intellectual property stipulates this flexibility. The same, of course, applies to parallel imports, since the agreement leaves this open to WTO members to decide what can or cannot be done. As far as we are concerned, we are also willing, at European Union level, to move ahead with this issue if it allows us to make progress on the issue of tiered pricing.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal provisions, which Mrs Carlotti mentioned, do not therefore present an obstacle. It is the ways in which they may be interpreted that could pose a problem. We have clearly stated our own interpretation. This, perhaps, goes further than some other WTO members would wish, but that is the situation, and we committed ourselves during the preparatory phase for the Doha meeting and in the ONPI and the WTO to push the consensus towards our own flexible interpretation of the WTO provisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, the aeronautical sector is one of the best examples of the implementation of the European Research Area at a sector of industry. In the light of global competition and given the impact of air transport on the life of European citizens, the Commission believes that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of aeronautical research through greater coordination and integration of the activities undertaken at all levels, i.e. national, European and private, into a single vision.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last six months of 2000, I formed the Group of Personalities, representing all parts of the air transport system including industrialists and manufacturers, airport management, airlines, regulatory authorities, air traffic controllers and researchers, whose aim was to shape this vision.</p>
<p class="contents">The fruit of the group’s labour is the report entitled ‘A Vision for 2020’, which defines the main technological objectives that the sector has set itself over a 20 year period and the resources that need to be put into practice in order to achieve these. The report focuses in particular on the need to improve the integration of research that is today being undertaken at various levels. The report recommends setting up an Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe or ACAR. ACAR will, in the main, be made up of representatives from national programmes, the industrial sector, the scientific community and the Commission. Its aim will be to draw up a strategic research agenda that all the players of the sector agree to, which will influence the research priorities of national and Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will make the utmost effort so that this council is up and running by the middle of this year. The ACAR members are due to be named by the end of May and the first meeting is scheduled for June. A first draft strategic agenda is expected at the beginning of next year. Consultation between the various players in this sector and the Member States with regard to ACAR’s competences and mandate has made a good start. This has already stirred up interest within the Member States, which all wish to take part in this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">A budget of EUR 1 billion for aeronautics and space will be provided for the new framework programme. There are four priorities – competitiveness, the environment, safety and the capacity of the air transport system. These four priorities already correspond to the main objectives of the Vision for 2020. In order to meet these objectives, the Commission is proposing to use three major instruments. The first is the networks of excellence, and the coordination that already exists between centres of research in the aeronautical sector should facilitate the implementation of these networks. The second is integrated projects, which essentially involves undertaking and further developing the unifying measures of the previous model of technology platforms. The final instrument is the European Union’s involvement in programmes run jointly by several Member States and which are of benefit to the Community, for example under Article 169 of the Treaty, such as those we shall have the opportunity to discuss at the debate on the new framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s action aims, over the long term, to stimulate the coordination of research undertaken at different levels by using the unifying effect of the instruments provided for in the framework programme and is perfectly in line with the agreements of the World Trade Organisation, the research actions sought being very competitive in nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That point is precisely at the centre of the dispute over the 1992 agreement on large aircraft construction. Does not the Commissioner see this programme as being yet another opportunity for us to have a dispute with the United States of America?</p>

<p class="contents">Can the Commission confirm that Denmark enjoys freedom of choice about whether to be a party to decisions taken under Title IV of the EC Treaty with the result, for example, that certain parts of decisions taken in the area of asylum and immigration can – also in the future – be acceded to by Denmark, while Denmark at the same time retains special national arrangements in other areas of asylum and immigration policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Article 3 of this protocol, which incorporates the Schengen acquis into the European Union, lays down that, with regard to decisions on implementing the Schengen acquis, Denmark can decide to guarantee the transposal of these decisions into its national law, thereby binding itself under an obligation under international law to the other Member States. With regard to issues of Community law, Denmark has reserved itself the opportunity to renounce the use of this exemption system, under the terms of its constitutional requirements and in the wake of an internal democratic debate. Nevertheless, the Danish Government recently asked the Commission about the possibility of applying certain rules adopted in the field of cooperation in judicial and civil matters to Denmark by means of parallel agreements with a basis in international law. A technical debate is now underway on this issue between Denmark and the Commission’s Directorate-General for Justice and Home Affairs. Once we have moved beyond this stage – and above all, once we have identified any difficulties in these parallel agreements – I intend to present the whole process to the Commission, that is to the whole College of Commissioners, following the exploratory technical discussions that are currently taking place. On the basis of this political debate, I also intend to lay down the future guidelines for the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is an ongoing debate in Denmark about Denmark’s position. It will be recalled that, as the Commissioner also explained, we have this exemption in Article 5 and Article 7 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark. Article 5 is a very simple rule specifying that, if the other Member States subject to Title IV of the Treaty should decide to develop the Schengen acquis, then the Danish government and the Danish parliament may, in accordance with the constitution, decide, within a period of six months, whether Denmark should or should not take part. The question is what a development of the Schengen acquis means. Currently, there is the issue of the EURODAC Regulation which I believe is very closely linked to Schengen cooperation and the Schengen system. Accordingly, it might be said that asylum and immigration issues are closely linked to the Schengen problems and the Schengen system. The question is how far we are prepared to go in applying Article 5 in developing the Schengen acquis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the passport is the only valid document for leaving the territory, which is the case in various Member States that do not issue identity cards, it must be valid for a period of not less than five years. Member States themselves are responsible for setting the conditions for issuing and validating the identity papers of their nationals. Incorporating the Schengen acquis into the European Union has not had any affect on these provisions. According to the Commission’s information, Sweden intends to introduce a national identity card with the status of travel document in accordance with Community directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it should be pointed out that Article 45 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement stipulates that persons wishing to stay overnight in a hotel must prove their identity by presenting a valid identity document. It should be noted that the Schengen acquis does not stipulate the type of identity document required. Consequently and in summary, the concept of a valid identity document can be interpreted to mean that all identity documents that have been accepted to date by the Nordic States as proof of identity can, in future, be presented when booking into a hotel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, if I understand the Commissioner’s answer correctly, it is nevertheless necessary to introduce passport requirements for journeys from one Nordic country to another, which means, in other words, that the Nordic Passport Union no longer exists.

What I said and would like to reiterate is that, up to now, the Swedish authorities have not notified any specific identity document to be recognised by all Member States as a travel document according to Directive 68/360, which does not mean that the Swedish Government has the intention to introduce changes in their identity cards due to the reason that you have mentioned. There is not a specific indication of nationality in that document. My evaluation is that the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> does not introduce any change in national travel documents because, as far as I know, that remains strictly the responsibility of Member States. Therefore I hope within the next few months we will be able to clarify the intentions of the Swedish Government concerning identity cards and the best interpretation of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>

We are dealing with the Protocol on Denmark, Article 5, paragraph 2, and I gather from the Commissioner’s answer that any rules regarding the carrying of certificates must be adopted unanimously and that if no agreement is reached, that is if Denmark takes up another position, then the parties must enter into negotiations. In principle, this is about a development of the Schengen acquis, a fact which I should like to hear confirmed, and when it is claimed to be about extension of freedom, that is quite ironic for me personally, as I believe it would become quite a burden for those of us who travel around with many types of euphoriants in our bags due to our delicate health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view and in the Commission’s view, there are now several reasons for considering the creation of a European corps of external border guards. Several Member States also seem to want to explore this option further in order to strengthen resources for combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries who are candidates to join the European Union will be required, in the long term – I stress the long term – to play a full role in implementing the Schengen acquis and the acquis communautaire, in the area, amongst others, of controlling the European Union’s external borders and of the unchecked free movement of individuals within internal borders. Even from the point of view of developing Community law, the only aim of external border controls is to check individuals purely in terms of migration. The controls also seek to ensure monitoring of external borders in terms of combating crime, or applying customs regulations and to ensure that various technical regulations that apply to vehicles or to dangerous or illicit merchandise are being respected.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why – and I am able to confirm this – the Italian Government has requested the Commission’s support to undertake a feasibility study on the possibility of setting up a corps of European border guards. This is an initiative that was also supported by several other Member States and which the Commission favours. As you know, any decision regarding this sort of programme supported by the Odysseus programme depends on the Management Committee. What I can say to you is that the Commission supports the Italian initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to the subject of the European Police College, which was created as a result of the Council decision of 22 December 2000, to which the European Parliament also contributed in the form of Mr Posselt’s report – I would like to say that in terms of its organisation, the College’s rules of procedure will be submitted for the Council’s information. The headquarters of the European Police College’s secretariat will be established on the basis of a forthcoming decision by the Council. Its operating budget will also be set. I can inform you that the College’s governing board approved its draft financial regulation on 23 March and this will now be submitted for approval to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the College’s working programme, we are working on the basis that the Police College must not be used to finance existing national actions and that it must concentrate on a few priority areas which are currently being defined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the honourable Member knows, the governments in Skopje and Belgrade recently reached agreement on border demarcation between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The European Union very much welcomes that agreement. Since the appearance of the armed Albanian extremists, the European Union has made clear its very strong support for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and we have made clear as well our support for the inviolability of borders. We have condemned the violence and we have argued passionately, as was the case for example at the European Council last weekend, that grievances must be addressed through democratic institutions. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is moving towards Europe. As the honourable Member will know, we are looking forward to signing a stabilisation and association agreement with the Macedonian leadership at the beginning of next week.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been intensively involved in trying to manage and prevent this crisis. We have all worked very closely together – the Presidency, the High Representative, the Member States and the Commission – and we have also worked closely with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. My latest trip to Skopje was yesterday. I went for the second time in about ten days with the High Representative. It was his third trip in that period. We have made clear once again that the Albanian population need to see the real opportunity for promoting their interests through political means. We are very pleased at the attempt made by President Trajkovski to launch a process of dialogue in Skopje. The first meeting of the political leaders that he brought together took place yesterday. We are ready to help in that process of dialogue but I have to make it clear that we do not think it is our role to mediate. It is our role to assist people in taking things forward but it is not our job to take the responsibility off their shoulders.</p>
<p class="contents">We appealed yesterday to the PDP Party to attend meetings of the dialogue in future. We had individual meetings with all the party leaders. All of them expressed their commitment to democracy. All of them expressed their commitment to dialogue. All of them expressed their commitment to joining the European family. So we now look to them to make good the undertakings that they gave us yesterday. We hope that they will talk to one another through the fora created by President Trajkovski. We hope that all of them, including the opposition, will participate in the signing ceremony of the stabilisation and association agreement next week.</p>
<p class="contents">We have said that we stand ready in the Commission to support the process of building a successful, multi-ethnic Community through our CARDS Programme and so on. We have made it clear to the Albanian leaders in Kosovo that the donor community's patience is not unlimited and that they have to make clear their own absolute abhorrence of violence in the attempt to move away from extremism. I think we have been doing all we can, but the political leaders in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia now have to show the leadership which is going to be required in order to get their country through this difficult period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a model which, unfortunately, we have seen and several countries backed it in the former Yugoslavia. I would like it to be made clear from your side – I think you expressed it well, but you could perhaps stress a little more – that no such way out will be given to extremists inside this country or, as you well know, outside it, to political forces in Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, it has to be the way forward for southeast Europe to turn its back once and for all on violence and the attempt to effect political change through bloodshed, mayhem, bombs and bullets. That is the path to Europe. That is what I will be discussing again tomorrow when I am in Croatia where they have, in my judgment, turned their faces to democracy and their backs to violence. It is the point I will be making in Albania on Thursday when we have the high level steering group which will be discussing the stabilisation and association process for Albania. I pay tribute now to the unequivocal statements made by the political leaders of the Albanian state in the last few days. But I want to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who believe that we can secure peace and prosperity in southeast Europe by fiddling with borders here and there are deluding themselves, and deluding themselves seriously. There is not just one Presevo Valley in the southeast of Europe. There are, in political terms, figuratively several. So if you start fiddling with the borders here you end up fiddling with the borders everywhere. Every time you do that you encourage those who think they can get their own political way by blowing up houses, buses with innocent women and children in them, or shooting police officers going about their lawful duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse what the honourable Member says, but I would go a stage further. There have been excellent signs in southeast Europe over the last 18 months of people coming back towards the democratic family. I took particular satisfaction myself in looking at the B92 radio station website at the weekend, which had the headline "Slobo in the slammer". I thought we had come a very long way in the last few years. I know that occasionally there are problems and not everything progresses smoothly, but I very much hope that we will not lose what has been achieved in the last 18 months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact of the matter is there is no good honest old-fashioned crime, but there are plenty of examples where organised criminality, organised criminal behaviour becomes interwoven with political extremism and its manifestation in organised violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen that in so many parts of Europe and we are seeing it once again in parts of south-east Europe, including no doubt the Kosovo-Macedonian and Kosovo-Serbia borders. While there are doubtless some who espouse political extremism for political reasons, there are others who see the advantage of cloaking criminal action – trafficking in drugs, trafficking in smuggled cigarettes, trafficking in human beings; they see political causes as a way of providing an umbrella for that criminality. Whatever it is, it is wrong, it must stop, it is what the past was like in south-east Europe.

They assured us that they were stepping up security on the border.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, like a lot of borders, difficult to give cast iron guarantees of security about the ability to pass from one side to the other. It is very mountainous terrain as the honourable Member probably knows but nevertheless I am sure that KFOR need to continue to do more. They are committing more troops. They are making a greater effort. It is essential that they do because there is no doubt at all that there have been people moving backwards and forwards across the border and the political consequences in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of movement of extremists from Kosovo into Macedonia make what has been a difficult crisis for them to face even more political and therefore even more awkward.</p>
<p class="contents">So yes, I hope KFOR will be able to do more.

It would also run against Russia's stated policy in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">During the visit which we made in February to Moscow and Kaliningrad – I went there with the Presidency, with Foreign Minister Anna Lindh – the issue was raised. The Russian side firmly denied the allegations which had been published in the media. The Russian side gave assurances that there were no plans regarding the deployment of nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad. I have seen the press and broadcast reports to which the honourable Member draws attention. That is why we raised the issue with the Russian side, but I repeat the assurances which they have given us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have had the privilege – in another, more informal Nordic context – of addressing this serious problem with the Commissioner. It is my understanding that the Commission has had assurances at the highest Russian level that no deployment has taken place. In spite of that, I should like to ask two follow-up questions: how has this information come to be accorded so much credibility by the media; and was this a subject that was discussed at all with President Putin at the European Council in Stockholm? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that the last thing anyone should do is to try to reduce Tetovo to the state of Grozny. I did not agree with those remarks of President Putin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not, of course, have the means to monitor Russia's compliance with the assurances that we have had, but we would expect Member States to raise any information indicating the contrary in the appropriate European Union fora. We will be having, in the margins of the General Affairs Council at the beginning of next week, a discussion on the northern dimension on the basis of the proposals which have been put forward by the Commission. That discussion will involve not only the Member States of the European Union, but also countries affected by our northern dimension policies and aspirations including, of course, the Russian Federation. And I hope that the Russian Federation will make it clear once again that these press reports and media reports are untrue.</p>
<p class="contents">One central part of our northern dimension policies is our attempt to suggest ways in which we can both help Kaliningrad to deal with the consequences of enlargement – that is, of being surrounded by Poland and Lithuania as Members of the European Union; and we have suggested as well, which is slightly different, ways in which Kaliningrad can be helped to deal with problems which have nothing to do with enlargement, but which have an impact on the whole area. We are keen to play our part in helping Kaliningrad, and it would not be remotely helpful if these media reports turned out even to be a percentage true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
