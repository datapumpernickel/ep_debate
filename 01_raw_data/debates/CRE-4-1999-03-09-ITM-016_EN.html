<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sarlis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its resolution of 13 January 1998 on the White Paper on a strategy for revitalising the Community"s railways – the personal work of Commissioner Kinnock – this House wholeheartedly and consistently supported the Commission"s strategy on virtually all its lines of attack. However, it also highlighted several important points. One of these was that we called upon the Commission to submit proposals in order to give railway undertakings the right of free access to railway infrastructure on the basis of an amendment to Article 10 of Directive 91/440/EEC regarding the operation of international freight transport, along with accompanying measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s new proposal, or rather the package of three separate proposals, one of which concerns the amendments to Directive 91/440/EEC, goes in the right direction but is not sufficiently substantial. The most important point I would like to highlight is that the Commission proposal fails to make recommendations for the gradual extension of the liberalisation of the railways, as I mentioned earlier, which this House introduced in its resolution of 13 January 1998. This omission becomes even more apparent when we realise that this issue has stagnated somewhat in Council circles and that the third directive of the package submitted by the Commission is essentially a measure accompanying a policy which is leading to partial liberalisation, which was set out in the White Paper and, above all, in Parliament"s resolution of January 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, in line with what I have already said and, most importantly, with the almost unanimous view of this House, which was expressed in January 1998, I put before the Committee on Transport and Tourism Amendment No 10 granting Community railway undertakings free access and transit rights on equitable conditions to the infrastructure in all Member States for the purpose of operating international railway services for the transport of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">This right currently exists only for international groupings of railway undertakings and not for individual railway undertakings. Ladies and gentlemen, we have the 1969 directive, which expressly provides for the gradual liberalisation of rail transport in the European Union – which was then the European Community – and has not been implemented since that time. As a result, with this amendment, which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we are putting back on track the process towards the gradual liberalisation of rail transport, starting with the transport of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 puts forward a new provision which obliges Member States to create legal entities, separate from railway undertakings, for the management of their national railway infrastructure, not later than two years following the date of entry into force of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the remaining amendments which I propose, and which have been adopted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, concern improvements to the Commission proposals. For example, Amendment No 5, in contrast to what was proposed by the Commission, reconfirms that responsibility for operating the control and safety systems lies with rail infrastructure providers.</p>
<p class="contents">Last of all, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to underline three things. Firstly, the reports being debated this evening in joint debate are harmonised and complement each other. Secondly, there has been an announcement from the German Presidency that, very soon, some time in March, it will take the initiative to promote issues relating to the railways. Thirdly, this is a significant milestone in the liberalisation of this important form of transport in Europe. I hope that the solidarity that was shown in the Committee on Transport and Tourism will still be there tomorrow during the vote.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR VERDE I ALDEA<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank my colleagues in the committee, who worked together admirably, and especially Mr Sarlis, with whom I cooperated closely. I am also grateful to our Commission colleagues, who provided us with a great deal of information and were most understanding, although I very much regret – as did the entire committee – that one Commission colleague decided in the end that none of the amendments was acceptable. Commissioner, I do not know what you will say; as a democrat of course I have to accept it. But I would certainly be sorry to see all the amendments simply dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission, I entirely agree with what you have repeatedly said, namely that the European railway system needs to be reformed. But I cannot agree with those – even if we have close political links in the unions and in other areas – who believe that it would be best to leave things as they stand, or who believe that the difficult problems with the railways had been created by the Commission"s proposals. No, the difficult situation of the railways has arisen partly because many railway undertakings believed they did not need to reform, they did not need to change anything, they could continue operating in a national framework. That is not true and in principle I agree with the ideas put forward by the Commissioner and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly true that the difficult situation as regards rail/road competition in my view disadvantages the railways and that this needs rectifying. In that regard I have taken several aspects into account. And I can understand that the unions and the railway undertakings are highlighting this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much talk of privatisation and liberalisation. But privatisation does not even come into question in this context, it is not being proposed. We can certainly consider liberalisation up to a certain point. I would prefer to say something different, in relation to our proposals: it is a question of Europeanising the railway system. Air transport has been Europeanised, all the undertakings have been Europeanised, there is a common market. However, many railway undertakings continue to believe they can frame their programmes at national level and then they wonder why freight traffic and employment and so forth are declining. That is untenable!</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I, like Mr Sarlis – and that is the thrust of my amendments – believe that we should target the next step towards liberalisation or Europeanisation at an area where we have a European market, where the competition between rail and road is particularly strong, namely cross‐border freight traffic; I have made the corresponding proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">So I entirely support the Commission"s basic premise and its proposals on opening up the market. It is up to the railway undertakings to decide whether to do so more in the form of cooperation or of competition. Of course we do not want new monopolies to emerge. It is a question of the transparency of the decisions, the transparency of the allocations. Although this sector has not been regulated, it is certainly also a question of technical framework conditions. So we need harmonisation in the technical field too. And it is a question of equal competition and fairness, not just between rail and road but also as regards the railways themselves, in these individual decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to a central point, where my opinion differs from that of the Commission. In particular it concerns the large number of both central and decentralised rules. I believe the Commission has done a very good job in many cases. Its detailed proposals are probably also the most sensible way to go about this. But I do not think it is always sensible of the Commission to want to propose and implement them without making the national rules sufficiently flexible in their turn. That is why I have deleted a fair number of provisions – and this really must not be seen as any disrespect for the Commission"s work here – not because I think they are bad but because I believe it is not the Commission"s job to regulate this in such detail, particularly since I am convinced that nobody can control all this centrally. I happen to believe that we should only adopt rules of this kind if compliance with them can also be checked, rather than having an abundance of rules that cannot be monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the charging principles, here again I agree with the Commission: on principle marginal charges should be required. But I think the external costs should only be charged in the railway system if they can also be charged at about the same rate for road traffic. I believe that a profit that bears a proper relation to the costs would be entirely acceptable and could be calculated, and that higher costs could also be charged for certain special investments. However, I have deleted the detailed rules on this from the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the central issue of the authorised applicant, I personally have nothing against the Commission"s views on this. But I have added one restriction, which I consider important to ensure that this is acceptable and that we really concentrate on what is necessary. Each country should continue to be able to regulate this as it wishes in its area of jurisdiction. But all European Member States must note and accept that for cross‐border freight traffic all European railway undertakings shall be regarded as authorised applicants, meaning that they shall be eligible to request capacity. I think that is the essential point. If we take this decision in Parliament tomorrow, then I believe it will be a real milestone in the development of a European railway system. We will then have competition in cross‐border freight traffic; that is where it is most important, that is where the railways must make efforts. For I hope we will take a decision on all those matters that the Commission is rightly proposing, such as on the European tax disc, on the Switzerland package and the fair distribution of costs between rail and road. It is vital for the railways also to show that they are willing to reform and to make the appropriate reforms. That is why I hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to accept some of these amendments and that this package will help us finally also to have a European railway system.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wibe </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (SV) </span> Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has adopted a number of amendments, all of which involve the deletion of sections containing over‐detailed rules. In general, one should be very careful about over‐regulating, for example in relation to charges, times of operation and so on. It can easily lead to a situation where the gains made through increased efficiency are swallowed up by administrative costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I should like to see a number of other requirements deleted. I do not believe it is possible to forcibly increase efficiency by means of highly detailed directives from Brussels. In my view, it is totally unacceptable for directives to specify the exact date on which all railway companies in the Union should change their timetables. The requirement that all railways should have separate accounting for freight and passenger transport is also quite unnecessary. Both these proposals may well cause serious problems, especially for small railway companies that wish to participate in the market, while the bigger former monopolies can easily adapt to them. Consequently, the proposals could, in practice, produce the opposite effect to that intended and become an obstacle to increased competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, before introducing all these detailed requirements, it would have been wiser to wait and assess the long‐term effects of the ground‐breaking directives approved by the Council in 1991 and 1995, which established the principle of increased competition in the rail sector.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sindal </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, these changes to existing directives and the adoption of a new directive on the allocation of infrastructure and the levying of charges represent a final break with national monopolies and provide opportunities for competition. Or is that really the case? As Mr Wibe has just been saying, there are problems. It is a long way from decision to reality. Consideration for public services and social obligations make the consequences difficult for many people. Many countries and regions are worried, and perhaps with reason. We should bear that in mind. But the opportunity for the renaissance of the railways is at hand, and that is what we should strive for. That is our goal. The goal is to ensure that an appropriate share of all transport work goes to the railways. Like the ports, the railways are also part of the transport chain and are therefore under an obligation to develop sustainable transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We must solve the problems of this process together with our citizens. This afternoon we discussed public services, competition and state aid with Commissioner Van Miert in a working group, and it is very interesting to see how things are developing in Europe. I believe we should be aware of the fact that changes and market developments do not happen by themselves. We have to prompt them in one way or another. Whether or not it is too detailed, as Mr Wibe suggests, I could not say at present, but if we want the best for the railways, we have to work on it seriously. Parliament should also say to the Council and the Member States that if we want something like this, then we also have an obligation to act. There has been a great deal of talk about the railways over the past ten years, but it has done little to help. Decisions need to be taken. The market will not change this situation by itself.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jarzembowski </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us see what you have to say to Mr Sarlis"s and Mr Swoboda"s proposals today. Compared with my own objectives, I do not think the demands made by either of them are tough enough. A year ago we called for a gradual liberalisation that took account of social framework conditions but was sufficiently clear‐cut. Nevertheless I endorse both reports. They are a balanced mix of Parliament"s views and I hope, Commissioner, that you will prove a rather more generous benefactor this time and accept the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address a few points. In my view we cannot accept that the railways should decline as a result of your deliberate policy of not applying European legislation. Directive 91/440/EEC – separation of infrastructure management and operation of trains – has been applicable by all Member States since 1986. Some simply refuse to do so. I hope that at least you, Commissioner, are in favour of the call in both reports for progress to be made towards this objective in the next two years. If need be, we will have to initiate proceedings here. For only if we separate the two can other railway undertakings also effectively use the railways; we want to see effective use made of the railway network, we do not want some countries to seal themselves off and not let anyone through. That is why we need a clear separation between infrastructure management and operation services; we need clear rights of access, as both colleagues called for, we need wider rights of access, lenient rights of access, but definite improvements; and thirdly, we need uniform rules on transport charges.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda, in your place I would have preferred not to bring up the idea of marginal costs. After the hearing in committee, we should not get involved in this. For the rest, I agree with you that if we look first at road costs – building and maintenance costs – we would say that external costs may only be increased if the other transport modes are required to bear similar costs. In the same way I would like to see the railways given greater opportunity to compete with the other transport modes on the basis of sensible and reasonable transport charges.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also think we must then say that regardless of how high or low we set the transport charges, they must be charged in all the Member States. We cannot have some Member States saying that temporarily, for the next two years, we will not impose any transport charges, at least not on certain routes. In this respect it is then up to the Commission to ensure equality under the law. In this difficult battle between Council, Parliament and Commission to open up the railways so that they will become client‐oriented and effective, we are on your side, Commissioner, and I hope you are on our side!</p>

Mr Jarzembowski is right in saying that there is indeed a broad measure of agreement on this amongst the various groups. And there were times when that was not the case, when we had some fairly heated clashes on the subject of railways. But there are a few facts that we must face. We have made nothing like the progress on railways which we ought to have achieved. The proportion of freight carried by rail continues to decline. So that is the opposite of what we actually want.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wibe has left the Chamber, but as draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy he said that there was not really any need to separate the exploitation of infrastructure from actual transport operations. I do not agree with him at all. How can we license individual operators if we do not make that separation? I think the Commission will have to press that point and stick to it.</p>
<p class="contents">And for this reason too, not so much because it makes all that much difference, but more because we wanted to send a signal, our group wished to maintain an amendment which says that we want to see the separation between the exploitation of infrastructure and rolling‐stock within the year, and not in two years" time. Why do we say that? Because the railways have had plenty of time since Directive 44/91. That is eight years ago. They have still not all taken the measures which the Commission wants the railways to take. So we should like to hear from the Commissioner how things stand, and which railway operators have not yet taken the necessary action and why not. And we want to see a real separation, not the kind between SNCF and VFF which is a separation in name only, and not in practice.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – I welcome this report on the need to upgrade the railway systems within the European Union, as well as guaranteeing the most efficient use of railway infrastructure to meet consumer needs. This is quite a timely report from an Irish perspective. Only last week the Irish Government announced a dual strategy involving the spending of £Irl 430 million on improving rail safety standards, alongside the expansion of commuter train services in Ireland. As a result of this investment, which I fully support, the suburban rail network will be increased in capacity in terms of over 60 %. As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, it is good news because towns such as Naas, Newbridge, Kilcullen, Wicklow, Athy, Arklow, Kildare and Monasterevin must all in the near future secure the necessary finance for the upgrading of their respective railway operations.</p>
<p class="contents">While the upgrading of rail infrastructure is of paramount importance, equal concern must also be the quality of service, and the Irish rail company Iarnród Éireann must, in my view, be up to the task. The legitimate request of the people in Monasterevin, for example, for the re‐opening of their train station and the people of Portlaoise for the upgrading of the service is fully justified. The overcrowding problem on suburban trains will also be eased by the addition of more passenger carriages, and platforms will also be lengthened.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Moreau </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR) </span>Mr President, with the reports by Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda the European Parliament is forced to take a stand which is fraught with consequences for the future of rail transport. The Commission"s directives – and, by extension, both reports – are in keeping with a policy of liberalisation, as they open the market in international freight transport to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sarlis"s report even goes beyond the Commission directives, which do not advocate liberalisation, for example by proposing to amend Article 10 of Council Directive 91/440/EEC. Yet, there has been no evidence in the railway sector to confirm the belief that liberalisation is the only way it can be revived. On the contrary, the sorry state of affairs that resulted from the liberalisation of British railways represents a genuine counter‐example. Conversely, high‐speed trains which have brought about the irrefutable development of railways could not have come into existence in a liberalised system. This is also the case for the first rail freight corridor which was set up on the basis of cooperation between public services.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to go back over two points. Firstly, the amendment of the concept of authorised applicants which allows any natural or legal person to request infrastructure capacity. This is likely to lead to a chaotic liberalisation with the increase in the number of new operators. The railway undertakings would thus be restricted to a role of service providers ensuring the traction of trains. This system can only lead to the most profitable sectors being creamed off, leaving the railway undertakings to take responsibility for personnel, maintenance of rolling stock, and the least profitable sectors. Only one liberty is therefore granted, that of allowing companies who are not at all involved in the rail sector to take the biggest share of the profits without providing the conditions for developing this sector. The nuance provided by the Committee on Transport and Tourism which makes it possible for Member States to provide for authorised applicants is an illusory precaution, since one unauthorised applicant in any given country would in fact impose itself on others.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to make concerns competition. Rail transport is subject to competition, competition from road transport which benefits from its small‐scale use of infrastructure and the extremely low level of social conditions it needs to provide. No effort is made to remedy this distortion of competition that is so costly in terms of the environment, social protection and safety. The reports by Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda advocate competition within the rail sector itself, which does not exist in any country and risks compromising the progress achieved, particularly in view of the specialised infrastructure for rail transport in comparison with that for road and air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with their trade unions and the ETUC, the railway workers of the European Union made known their opposition to the liberalisation of railways during a day of large‐scale strike action across the European Union. Within the Council, governments are divided on the issue: some, including the French Government, are against it, whilst others think there is no need to force liberalisation on countries that do not want it. For this reason, before voting starts tomorrow, I will be requesting that both these reports be referred back to committee so that Parliament does not take such an important decision as this in haste.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must reject the liberalisation proposals and envisage instead measures to encourage the development and modernisation of the rail sector and its public service obligations, as well as the development of cooperation and social harmonisation at a high level.</p>

We are happy with them. Discussions outside Parliament often assume that the Greens will probably be against, like our colleagues on the left. That is a major misconception. The Greens are in favour of more freight going by rail, and they are for fair competition and against monopolies, whether they are private or state monopolies. So we are also in favour of breaking national monopolies on the management of infrastructure. We are in favour of transparent administrative and financial structures for managing infrastructure and providing services. We are in favour of the market being opened up to all kinds of responsible operators, with an independent body to scrutinise them. And I would say in reply to Mrs Moreau that this is not a kind of wild west‐style liberalisation or privatisation. In our opinion it is a gradual, cautious but very resolute attempt to ensure a future at last for rail freight. We all know that the market share of the railways has declined in recent years. That trend has to be reversed, and I think that these proposals are a good start.</p>

<p class="contents">The proposal to end monopolies and separate infrastructure management from railway undertakings is an interesting one but how are we going to guarantee the adequate maintenance of lines that are less profitable in economic terms but that are needed by society? We cannot forget that railways are a strategic element in vital development in many regions. Let me give you an example: service on the only international link through the central Pyrenees, through Canfranc, has been interrupted as a bridge collapsed on the French side and it has not been repaired. It has not been repaired for 30 years. The reason for this is very simple: the line was not very profitable for the publicly‐owned undertaking that was operating it and, as a result, the line is now closed. Moreover, there is no possibility of other more efficient undertakings using it. In other words, the deterioration of infrastructures is hindering the liberalisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we must find ways to ensure that networks are maintained, no matter what their current uses and profitability may be. In contrast, liberalisation will only lead to reduced services, particularly in the less developed European regions.</p>

The consequences of their previous position as state‐run operations and the changing market conditions are two things which are totally irreconcilable. Their operating results show that they are underperforming both in terms of services and financially. In the interests of consumers and of our environment, it is vital that this should change. We have to capitalise on the advantages of rail as a reasonably clean and high‐capacity mode of transport. From practical experience, we know that the railways are unable to effect this change themselves. So policy measures are needed to encourage market‐oriented thinking. Opening up the sector may cause the wind of change to blow through some dusty offices.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, however, the financial situation of the present operators means that access to the railway market cannot yet be totally free. So the proposal to proceed gradually for the time being and with support, involving only international freight traffic, is the right one. If the outcome is to be satisfactory in social terms, government departments in the Member States must oversee the implementation of the plans. They must also ensure that there is an adequate organisational separation of services within the railway companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a word on the levy for infrastructure. In railway transport too, all costs have to be covered. We must strive for equal conditions of competition. Given the advantages of this mode of transport, its competitive position must not be neglected. The railways desperately need a powerful stimulus. These reports are a good way of starting the process.</p>

But I note that Mr Hyland has left.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Pavlos Sarlis and Hannes Swoboda for their work in this very important area. It has been, for a long time now, a priority of my group to revitalise the railways of the European Union. We have also recognised that the action that needs to be taken to enable our railway industry to survive has to be radical in its approach, innovative in its conception and courageous in its actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The scale of the problems facing the railway industry cannot be underestimated. At a time when the overall transport market is expanding, we find that rail's share of that market has been reduced to no more than 6 % of the passenger – and 16 % of the freight – sector. Put simply, the railway sector throughout the EU is in such a perilous state that we have to question whether international passenger services or freight services will still exist in 15 years' time. Therefore, if I can use a medical analogy here, we have a very sick patient who is in need of major help, and I believe that our two rapporteurs, along with the Commission, have given us the medicine to make our railways fit and healthy well into the next century.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some in the railway industry, and indeed, some in this Parliament, who believe that we can carry on with a system that is based on old working practices, functioning only within a national network based on the ideals of the 1930s.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes that the status quo is not an option in this case, and that those who believe it is will contribute to the death of our railways. If we are to ensure that railways have a future outside of commuter services, particularly in freight, then we have to take the actions that have been outlined to us by our rapporteurs. Rail cannot compete in the freight sector against road haulage if the service it has to offer takes 67 hours to travel 850 kilometres in comparison with 13 hours by truck.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my group recognises that there are concerns amongst railway workers – after all, we are proposing a shift in emphasis that is quite radical. This is why we have supported a more guarded approach to the introduction of free market rules in other areas outside of freight, coupled with social protection measures, and with the public service obligation a high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an opportunity today to lay the foundations for a new railway age in the new millennium. My group welcomes that opportunity and supports the Commission and our rapporteurs in their efforts to secure a future for Europe's railways.</p>

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate both rapporteurs on the exceptionally hard work they have put in on each report.</p>
<p class="contents">It gives me particular pleasure, in the presence of the British Commissioner here tonight, to recognise a historic moment at which the Commission has caught up with Britain; Britain being the first country to liberalise its railway network, which was, at the time, a brave move, foreshadowing these Commission proposals, and bringing, in my view, very positive results: more passengers travelling by train, more freight travelling by rail and therefore off the roads, with high levels of safety achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The main proposals contained in the Commission proposals and Mr Sarlis' and Mr Swoboda's reports, and the three main developments, are very welcome: greater transparency, separating the provision of the infrastructure from the operation of services on it; for accounting purposes, taking infrastructure, passenger and freight operations and putting them into separate business units; extending the current E regime for licensing international operators to all rail sectors, both domestic and international, across the European Union; making track charging and train path allocation based on principles regarding how the charges should be set and what conditions should apply in the allocation of train paths.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome these proposals and the developments towards the liberalisation of the rail sector. But these are modest steps. We think we should have progressed much further to open up the European market for all types of international freight. The challenge is to make this a truly single market for European railways. More needs to be done, especially on the licensing system, requiring operators to participate in certain common arrangements for networking and resolving the question of marginal cost pricing.</p>

The French members of the ARE Group oppose the direction that is being taken here, as it does not seem capable of resolving the present difficulties in the rail sector. Why is this?</p>
<p class="contents">Introducing more competition in rail transport at this time will serve only to undermine a sector which is already in difficulty. The privatisation of British railways at the start of the 1990s led to dissatisfaction amongst the general public and a deterioration in the quality of service. According to the Sunday Times, British railways have since been less reliable and less punctual than those in Pakistan, India and China. We can therefore understand why railway workers protested last year against the shift towards liberalism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not opposed to increasing cooperation between European railway undertakings, in accordance with the examples set in passenger transport by <span class="italic">Thalys</span> or <span class="italic">Eurostar</span> . As regards freight transport, we began setting up freight corridors between France and its neighbouring countries at the end of 1997 at the initiative of the Commission; these have allowed the capacities required for long‐distance rail links to be requested for freight. So why change direction before we have had a chance to develop this approach? The Community should instead help to complete infrastructure, set up trans‐European networks and facilitate the technical and social harmonisation of railways.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore fighting to encourage as much coordination as possible between European railway undertakings. Who better than the public authorities to take up such a challenge by creating vast networks and rail freight corridors across the Union. While we are not against all aspects of the draft directives, we cannot support the measures seeking to open up the market, as provided for in the definition of authorised applicants in the draft Council Directive 95/19/EC, or Amendment No 10 by Mr Sarlis, seeking to broaden the scope of Council Directive 91/440/EEC.</p>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that these are two very important reports. The whole package of measures is crucial to the further development of European policy on rail transport; or I could say, looking at the station clock, that we had better run for the train so as not to miss it, that it is high time Parliament and the Council finally tackled this subject. So I welcome the proposals on gradual liberalisation and boosting competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect is the separation between railway undertakings, the separation between transport infrastructure management and transport services, between use and maintenance. This separation is vital to prevent distortion of competition and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point to the importance of the railways in relation to combined transport. The railways are a more environmentally friendly, safe and expandable mode of transport and must therefore continue to be supported in future. As we all know, the capacity of the railways is still far from exhausted, in relation to the transport of both goods and passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital for the railways to become competitive and become a serious alternative to road transport. The EU and the Member States must remedy any shortcomings in this respect if they genuinely are to put forward a credible policy in support of an environmentally friendly transport mode. That also means allocating the necessary budget funds. Shifting transport from road to rail will help preserve the environment throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to promote rail transport with a view to the new Member States we will no doubt be welcoming among us one day.</p>

European railways, with their outdated structures, have declined steadily since the 1960s. The Commission's White Paper on a strategy for revitalising the Community's railways and the proposal relating to trans‐European freight corridors were the first step in a new direction. The fact that the work is now in hand is a positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the reports before us today represent further necessary steps along the same road. In particular, today's debate demonstrates that there is a far greater understanding of the need for continued liberalisation if we are to halt the rapid decline.</p>
<p class="contents">There will certainly have to be more liberalisation if constructive changes are to come about. Amongst other things, there is a need for a division in all the Member States between those who are responsible for the tracks and those who run trains on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Presumably, it is perfectly reasonable that the various states will, for the most part, continue to own, build and maintain most of the infrastructure. However, it is equally reasonable that competition among the operators who use their tracks should be as free as possible. The infrastructure should be financed mainly by all those who use the tracks paying for the privilege. Should that happen, the national companies will doubtless continue to be the major operators, but they will have to compete with others on the same terms. This is the direction in which things are going today. The Transport Committee's report supports this type of development, which will allow new railway companies to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports we are considering today both take a decisive step in that direction, thereby giving Europe's railways the chance to develop positively in the future. However, it is worth emphasising that this is only the first step. The Commission must continue to come up with further initiatives if the railways are to have a future in the twenty‐first century.</p>

These reports certainly advance the debate on the future of railways, which is essential to the changes that have to be pursued if rail is to fulfil its true potential in modern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a theme that has been taken up and emphasised by just about every speaker in the course of the debate tonight. Rail is in competition with road, as Mrs Moreau says, and the tragedy is that rail, for the last three decades, has become an increasingly poor second. What is evident from all that experience therefore is that carrying on with current conventions simply will not do. If rail is to have real vitality, then rail is going to have to change. What we are putting forward in this proposal and, indeed, other proposals is very strictly related to trying to achieve that objective, with all the economic, transport, environmental and employment implications and benefits that stem from that.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with Mr Sarlis' report on the Commission's proposal to amend Council Directive 91/440 on the development of the Community's railways. Naturally I am grateful for the support given to our proposals in the report and the very hard work of Mr Sarlis on this issue over a very long period of time. As I welcome the report, I also take serious note of Mr Sarlis' observation that the proposed amendments may not be sufficiently substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to say that we can accept the majority of the committee's proposed amendments. Indeed, I have to say that we do not reject the others because we think they would be unacceptable in principle; we cannot accept them simply because they would be likely in practice to increase the difficulty of getting wider agreement to this package in the Council. In short, we share many of Mr Sarlis' views but if we accept some of his amendments there is a real danger that in pursuing the best we could risk losing the good. I hope he understands, therefore, that our inability to accept some of his proposals is a product of necessary pragmatism and not opposition in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main areas where the committee favours an approach that would be more radical than that proposed by the Commission, and I should like to concentrate on them.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I want to emphasise that I am grateful for the strong support given for further liberalisation of the railway sector through the careful creation of greater access rights. I also share the conviction that rapid progress is now essential – indeed, that has been the case for some time past. I hope, therefore, that this Parliament will be able to encourage a similar view amongst those Member States which are still reluctant to accept the need for such advance.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that, I also have to emphasise that the proposals before the House this evening are not liberalisation proposals. We have always argued and very strongly emphasised that this package – on the separation of management, on licensing, on capacity allocation and on other relevant issues like charging practices – is required whether further access rights are created or not. This package is required simply to make the legal proposals that theoretically govern rail in the European Union work as they were intended back in 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the Council still has our proposal to extend Article 10 of Directive 91/440 in a way that is similar to what we are proposing here.</p>
<p class="contents">Both of these factors lead me to believe that while fully endorsing the position set out in Mr Sarlis' report, it would not be productive to include the rapporteur's proposed text in our proposal and, therefore with reluctance, we have to reject Amendment No 10.</p>
<p class="contents">I sympathise with the view expressed in the report that the Commission did not go far enough in requiring separation of railway undertakings from infrastructure managers. However, our position has to be to achieve what is legally required while, at the same time, permitting those Member States which do not favour complete separation to retain a single overall railway company. We have consequently required the separation of those functions which determine access to the infrastructure. Nevertheless, we have no objection in principle to going further where that is consistent with the practical purposes. I am glad to be able to incorporate Amendment No 6 in our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In a similar manner, I could accept the proposed Amendment No 11, which would require the same separation but in a shorter time period.</p>
<p class="contents">However, even with full separation we still have to ensure that essential regulatory functions – licensing functions, for instance – are not carried out by incumbent railway undertakings. Nowadays this situation borders on the absurd as well as being extremely distortive of potential competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that honourable Members also share that view – indeed it has been expressed in the course of this evening. That is why we have to reject Amendment No 4, which would, in practice, have removed this specific requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other amendments which we do not feel able to accept. The first is Amendment No 3, which would remove the laying down of safety rules from recital 4 in the proposal. I believe that this function is as important as the monitoring and enforcement of the safety rules and that it must also therefore be referred to in the text. On reflection, I hope that honourable Members will accept that point and not pursue the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment that we cannot accept is Amendment No 12, which removes the reference to railway undertakings having to provide rail services. It results in a less clear definition and is, in our view, an unnecessary change. In short, therefore, the Commission accepts Amendment Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11, whilst rejecting Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 10 and 12.</p>
<p class="contents">I now move to Mr Swoboda's report, which deals with the other two proposals in this package of measures. With regard to the proposal to amend Directive 95/18 on the licensing of railway undertakings, we are glad to accept the first amendment but we have to reject the second amendment, which seems to us not to be based on relevant criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the report deals with the proposal for a directive on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for use. Here again I am happy to say that we wish to incorporate almost half of the amendments in our revised proposal. Those include most of the new recitals, the definition changes and the creation of the charging framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I have great sympathy with the view that Community legislation should not be over‐prescriptive. Mr Swoboda proposed a number of amendments that helpfully sought to simplify this proposal. Some of the simplifications are, as I say, welcome but we felt unable to endorse some others which appear to cut into the substance of the proposal – inadvertently, I am absolutely certain.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these latter amendments deal with the proposed rules for capacity allocation. In our view, it is important to establish precise procedural rules in order to ensure that these processes, which go to the very heart of being able to offer railway services, are coordinated and fair to all undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore endeavour to make some simplifications along the lines that have been suggested by Mr Swoboda, but maybe not to the degree that he envisages.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of key points that I would like to address before concluding. Firstly, there are the charging rules. We believe that the proposal in Amendment No 12 to include a rate of return in Article 8 (3) is unnecessary since such a provision already exists in the proposal in respect of investments and for passenger services. Amendment No 13, to reduce the text relating to external costs in Article 8 (5), is not acceptable to us. That is because the purpose of our text was to create clear conditions for the development of these charges for rail while safeguarding rail from undue experimentation. I feel that the simplified text is insufficiently precise and therefore I have to resist that text.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the changes proposed in Amendment No 15 to the discount provisions in Article 10, set out principles which we believe should apply to this type of business as defined in the ruling in the Zaventem airport charges. It is preferable for all concerned that these are very clearly understood. The key proposed change relating to charges is Amendment No 14 on Article 9 of the proposal. Here again there is a strong desire to simplify the rules and also to permit some of the higher charges for freight traffic. We can accept those principles though the proposed wording causes some difficulty and we will have to re‐examine that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of authorised applicants in Article 19. The Commission strongly believes that whether or not there is further progress on access rights, the concept of authorised applicants can create more attractive conditions for large purchases of rail transport services. It will encourage them to place greater reliance on this mode of transport. They have to make a stronger commitment to rail. One would have presumed that all the rail companies and all indeed working in rail would welcome a real inducement for large rail users and potential rail users to use this facility of authorised applicants in order to strengthen further their commitment or even to make a new commitment to the use of rail. I know that both Parliament and the Commission want that greater commitment to rail. I suggest that this is one very practical way of securing that commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of that we cannot support the demotion of this concept to a matter for national legislation as suggested in Amendments Nos 19 and 5. It is the concept, the authorised applicant, that can be particularly important at international level in view of the fact that there are currently no cross‐border railway undertaking. To use Mr Swoboda's very useful phrase, we want this application in Community law in order, literally, to Europeanise the prospect of this means of increasing the attractiveness of rail freight transport for major users.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as I mentioned briefly, Amendments Nos 19 to 27 seek to simplify the articles dealing with capacity allocation. But unfortunately and, I think inadvertently, these would delete important elements such as the requirements to treat all services equally and to consult during the scheduling and coordination process and in the development of enhancement plans. I subscribe to the objective of simplification and we will therefore look very hard to see how the text can be tidied up. But the loss of these elements through the adoption of the proposed amendments would be a cause of significant concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to deal with the proposed Amendments Nos 17 and 18 and their implication of reintroducing the priority rules from Directive 95/19. One objective of the Commission proposal which I am certain that the rapporteur and others share is to make freight and passenger rail more commercially attractive, not least because it will ensure better use of infrastructure and lead to consequent reductions in costs for all services. Clearly where there is an absolute shortage of capacity choices have to be made. Our proposal does not stop one type of traffic being favoured in those circumstances. I believe that it would be a mistake, therefore, to seek to grant better treatment to one type of traffic over another during the normal allocation process. In addition, the ability to grant special rights to enable the development, for example, of new or dedicated infrastructure is already clearly provided for in Article 27 of the existing proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept the new proposed amendments to the Swoboda report: Amendments Nos 29 and 31 would change the definition of railway undertaking. The consequences would be a loss of clarity in the definition and therefore, as I hope the House will accept, unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The change to authorised applicants in Amendment No 30 restricts its scope to licensed railway undertakings, thereby negating the objective and indeed the effect of the proposal. Consequently we cannot accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, therefore, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 28 as well as the principles contained in Amendment No 14.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that honourable Members can agree with me that our underlying objectives are similar – indeed almost identical – and that even though we cannot accept all of the proposed amendments, we will endeavour to incorporate the objectives of many of the amendments in our revised proposal. In particular, I am confident that Mr Swoboda's report will provide significant strengthening for the further discussions in the Council. Mr Sarlis' report will also have that beneficial effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we are far from the end of this process. I warmly welcome Parliament's continued interest and the pressure for progress. I conclude by thanking both rapporteurs – Mr Swoboda and Mr Sarlis – and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their valued support on all of the essentials. I hope that the whole House will endorse their constructive approach.</p>

I hope that Commissioner Kinnock, despite his negative stance today on certain basic issues, listened, and that there will be some scope and some space available for him to reverse his negative views over time, as tomorrow – as I have been informed and as my colleagues are aware – he will be confronted with two proposals which have been unanimously adopted by the European Parliament. It is impossible for us to move forward, that is, for the Commission not to push through Article 10 and yet to ask us to fully accept the concept of authorised applicant. This is a position which, I think, no one is going to accept. I ask, therefore, that we have the benefit of a revision of opinions.</p>
