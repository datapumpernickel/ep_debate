<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are fully aware of the way in which women’s rights are violated around the world. When they are, it is on the basis of a number of values, including tradition, social cohesion or the honour of the male members of a family. Genital mutilation of women is seen as upholding this tradition. Murder or mutilation for reasons of honour are seen as a way of maintaining peace within society, and the public stoning or chastising of women is condoned in the context of maintaining the social order.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the international community is increasingly showing its dissatisfaction with this situation, as is illustrated by the reaction to the stoning of Amina Lawal, the admittedly late reaction to the Taliban regime and the persistent questions about the death of photo journalist Zahra Kazemi in Iran. At the same time, campaigns for women’s rights are receiving recognition. The award of the Nobel Prize to Shirin Ebadi, the women’s and children’s activist in Iran, is also an extremely important signal, as was this afternoon’s statement of Senegal’s President Wade in this Chamber. President Wade made express reference to his fight against the genital mutilation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we have to ask ourselves is whether Europe, via the various channels that the EU has at its disposal, is indeed adopting a structured policy with regard to serious violations of women’s rights. In any event, the beginnings of a policy are in place. The Cotonou Agreement with the ACP countries makes specific mention of genital mutilation. In addition, the express reference in the Budget that failure to take measures to prevent serious violence against women – and it specifies stoning, public castigation, burning, and rape – justifies the suspension of EU aid.</p>
<p class="contents">This EU policy, though, shows too little in the way of structure. This is why Parliament is asking for some sort of system to be adopted. What could constitute such a system? A number of sanctioning elements, for example, the inclusion in trade and cooperation agreements of a specific clause in which it is made explicit that the serious and repeated violation of women’s rights may ultimately entail suspension of cooperation, is one such sanctioning element.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, these sanctions and suspensions must be imposed when governments systematically fail to take measures in the legislative, administrative and judicial fields. There could, of course, also be positive aspects, though. There is, for example, the systematic inclusion in development aid programmes of projects aimed at fighting violence against women or pressing for, and taking account of, the fact that partner countries ratify the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), as well as the additional protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of this might be the talks, or negotiations, that are going on with Iran. We are very much looking forward to the document that will eventually be on the table. This document must, in our view, make express reference to actions to counter violence against women, to women’s rights and also to the CEDAW.</p>
<p class="contents">Another possibility is for the Commission to provide staff trained to examine agreements with third countries from the gender perspective, in which local women’s organisations in the developing countries must also be involved. The EU Member States, and Europe too, could demand legislation against genital mutilation. In addition, when refugee status is granted, consideration should be given to the fact that some women flee the violence in their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has taken as one of its watchwords the protection of human rights, which includes the rights of women. More than any other region, the EU is expected to act, in some sense, as the world’s conscience in this respect. I should like to ask the Commission to what extent it is prepared to adopt a far more structured approach to policy in connection with this problem. I have received a positive response to a number of questions I have raised, but they are all ad hoc actions. There is, in fact, little structure in current policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were a very distinguished vintage. I would like to thank Ms Smet for her work as rapporteur on this report. Her political commitment to the cause of women's rights is well known in both the Commission and the Council. This own-initiative report raises a wide range of issues. It is an extremely valuable contribution in placing women nearer the centre of the European Union's foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The violation of women's rights in international affairs is an extremely serious issue. It is an issue to which the Commission and the European Union both attach considerable importance. This year alone, we have launched three major gender initiatives, under what we call the Programme of Action for the Mainstreaming of Gender Equality and Community Development Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have set about the drafting of a concise manual setting out essential principles and guidelines for gender mainstreaming in development practice, and it is targeted at Commission officials. Secondly, we have issued a call for tender for the setting-up of a very large training programme for staff, both in our headquarters in Brussels and in delegations, including also the staff of beneficiary countries. Thirdly, we have launched a call for proposals to support non-governmental organisation projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also been very active in contributing to EU efforts to promote the human rights of women in international fora, such as the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, and the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE. For example, we co-sponsored the resolution on the elimination of violence against women at the last Commission on Human Rights. It was tabled, as the House will know, by Canada, and we issued a strong statement on the human rights of women which highlighted, among other things, the growing problem of trafficking in human beings and the advantages of gender mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I would like to underline today is that it is our belief that women’s rights are an integral part of human rights as a whole. And for this reason, I would like to express the reservations of the Commission over certain recommendations within the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The item of principle concern to us is the call for the 'Council and Commission to include in future trade and development agreements, irrespective of and in addition to the essential elements clause, a specific clause providing for the imposition of sanctions and ultimately the suspension of the agreement in cases of serious and repeated violations of women’s rights'.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure most Members will agree, when considering issues such as equality, non-discrimination and violence, women’s rights are best addressed in the overall framework of human rights</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as quoted in the honourable Member's report, the declaration from the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights clearly underlines that 'the human rights of women and the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights.' Moreover, it is important to realise that violence against women on a state level is an integral part of the human rights provisions dealing with torture and the death penalty, which are our priorities in terms of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth noting that a separate clause on women’s rights would also imply the need to include various other human rights issues as individual clauses in subsequent trade and co-operation agreements; that is to say for example, a clause for the rights of the child, or a clause for the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights clause is a dynamic instrument through which we can advance human rights in a positive manner. The measure of its success is not found in the frequency with which it results in punitive measures or suspension of agreements but rather in the structured exchanges on human rights which result in a more realistic way of realising the goals of the human rights clause.</p>
<p class="contents">By separating women’s rights from the overall human rights agenda, Parliament would not necessarily, whatever its admirable intentions, be serving the cause of human rights. Indeed, such a separation would possibly result in a lessening in its leverage on the political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give an example, a case in point. I would like to refer to the current negotiations with Iran on a trade and co-operation agreement. Central to the human rights dialogue with Iran – and I think I can say that I played a prominent part in getting it started – is the issue of discrimination against women and Iran’s non-ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. It would seem that in certain cultural environments, it is advantageous for women’s rights to enter the agenda under the mantle of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not make these points simply theoretically, simply as a result of intellectual or academic study. I was discussing these issues most recently in Syria with a women's rights lawyer, as part of our discussions there to try to get an association agreement with Syria. I have discussed these issues in Iran with, for example, female members of the Iranian parliament. So they are issues about which I can assure the House, even if I disagree with what is proposed, they are issues about which I feel pretty strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important human rights instrument with regard to women’s rights is the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democratisation. The instrument is very active in involving local women’s organisations in third countries. And although gender equality is a horizontal issue under this European initiative, many specific gender projects have also been supported. For example, we are currently funding a project in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon West Bank and Gaza for legal aid and literacy, for counselling for women victims of violence and for awareness campaigns and research.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the House will take account of our arguments that it is not necessary to have a separate clause in trade and cooperation agreements, since this is an area and an issue fully addressed by our human rights agenda. I also hope that the House will not conclude from what I have said that we do not give as much priority to the issues very properly raised, for example, gender mutilation which I have not mentioned in this debate. I hope that the House will not think that we do not give the greatest possible priority to these issues. In my experience, as a long retired development minister, one of the crucial issues, perhaps <span class="italic">the</span> crucial issue, in sustainable development policy is gender mainstreaming and decent treatment of women.</p>

Female genital mutilation is still practised today, as are stoning and sexual exploitation. All this is unacceptable for two reasons: these practices constitute violations of fundamental human rights and are out-and-out attacks on democracy. The European Union, therefore, must use every means at its disposal to fight these iniquities. The Union’s foreign policy is one such means, as Mrs Smet makes clear in her excellent and also very brave report, on which I would like to congratulate her. The European Union has indeed written a clause on respect for human rights and democracy into every agreement concluded with third countries. It has still not been effective enough, however, in combating violence against women. There is thus a need for stronger resolve and greater clarity in defining the commitments to be honoured by third countries in the field of women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">A carrot-and-stick approach to commercial and development agreements must be adopted in future. By way of a carrot, countries pursuing policies that yield effective results in combating violence against women must be rewarded via the establishment of incentives and more favourable commercial agreements. As for the stick: by way of sanctions, those countries which tolerate grave violations of women’s rights must submit to the suspension of the agreements which benefit them. In the latter scenario, however, the possible negative effects on the people of such sanctions must be carefully assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it must be ensured that development aid programmes include projects specially geared towards women’s rights and combating violence. Such projects must include active participation by local women. Indeed, the change in attitudes towards these practices must be brought about through an alliance with women who have been or are being subjected to this kind of violence, and who want to fight it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that we have made plenty of progress in terms of statements and words. It is easy to hear political leaders saying that women’s rights are human rights and that, as such, they must be protected and defended. The only problem is that, following these statements, when action should come, nothing happens.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights of women are always relative. Relative to traditions, to cultures, to families; we always find that a degree of relativity is involved when we have to apply specific protection to women who suffer very serious persecution, which we all know about, which has been described and information on which is available to anybody and is horrifying.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has already approved guidelines aimed at persuading governments to make decisions on asylum requests in a way which guarantees adequate attention for women within the procedures for determining refugee status, and that applications for reasons of gender should be recognised as such.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are ultimately talking about is genuinely protecting, <span class="italic">de facto</span>, the human rights of women at international level, and we have the instruments. For some reason, it is much easier to obtain refugee status when a person is persecuted for political reasons than when a person is persecuted a result of their sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Women at risk of genital mutilation do not know that they may have international protection, because we do not tell them, because we never take the step forward necessary to really use the legal protection instruments available to us to protect women.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Smet’s report points out several ideas which I believe would be very useful in terms of working with third countries with regard to the protection of women’s rights, but it is the case that we lack one of the instruments, which is, precisely, the possibility for women to seek protection within our borders, within the framework of our legal protection, something which is, however, available in other situations which are clearly comparable with those suffered by women.</p>
<p class="contents">The percentage of persecuted women who are granted refugee status is truly ridiculous. These are the cases which should really be studied if we are to realise that our statements must become specific actions, because – and I would insist – in letters, in statements, in Constitutions, even in many documents from this Parliament and from the Commission, we have recognised that it is essential to protect the women suffering this persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">When I talk about persecution, moreover, I am talking about serious aggression, not just any old thing. I am talking about stoning, about genital mutilation, about burning, about mutilation with acid, about crimes of honour, about enforced marriages, about slavery and about sexual exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">If all of these are not reasons to protect women under international law, then what are? Why do we not take a step forward and accompany our statements with specific actions? Why do we not say to women that they should not worry, that they have a place to turn to when they are suffering serious aggression? The reason is that we are prepared to recognise these aggressions as serious violations of human rights, but we are not prepared to offer them the solutions that we offer in other similar situations. We are not prepared to do so, furthermore, for the simple reason that they are – that we are – women without power.</p>

It has in actual fact been admirable. I should also like to thank Commissioner Patten for his speech, even if I have to say that I felt myself to be far more in agreement with a long list of other speeches than I actually did with this one.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament, we very often discuss EU defence, foreign and security policy, and the Commissioner takes the lead in these areas. We would also say in this connection that the EU should not only be an economic power in the world, that is to say a ‘soft’ power, but also a ‘hard’ power, in other words also have a military preparedness and become, if not a superpower, then in any case a military power.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not disagree that we should have a common foreign, security and defence policy, but anyone and everyone, and especially the Commissioner, knows that it will take some time before this happens. It is not tomorrow that we shall obtain the military capacity and agreement on EU foreign and security matters for which we might all wish. We are, however, already an economic power. We are a powerful factor in the economic area, and that is a factor I think we should exploit much more intensively than we do.</p>
<p class="contents">We might well, of course, help the oppressed half of the population, that is to say women, that genuinely suffers from a long list of injustices on a variety of fronts: partly cultural traditions, decided by men; partly violence when men do not get their way; and partly trade, because men want to make profits from women; and so on and so forth. We might well intervene and do something more in these areas. Mrs Smet has herself mentioned the Taliban regime, which did not only take the most basic rights, such as educational rights, away from women, but also every possible other right. This is an area in which the EU can do something, but are we doing enough? The Commissioner says we are doing a lot, but are we doing a sufficient amount, and are we doing it systematically enough?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that one of the things we could perhaps do in response to this report might be to debate further whether we might not be able to do things more systematically, whether it might not be possible for us to obtain some reports from the Commission on what is actually happening in connection with certain cooperation agreements, and whether anything at all practical ever happens at all when violations of basic human rights, and not merely of women’s rights, occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is nice about our committee – the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities – is that we can often agree from right to left. I agree with a lot of what previous speakers have said. I nonetheless wish to point out to Mrs Dybkjær that the view that the European Union should become a very strong military power is not shared by everyone present in this Assembly. That is not, however, something that we should debate here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">It was interesting to hear you, Commissioner Patten, say that, as long as 20 years ago, you appreciated the need to promote women’s rights as universal human rights. The problem is that not everyone in your position – or in lower positions, for that matter – has arrived at that insight. That is partly why we are standing here today with a report such as this to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Smet also addresses the internal criticism in our Member States, which makes its presence felt indirectly. Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco talked a lot about the asylum procedure. I could also talk for hours about the way in which, above all, the deportation of asylum seekers – when they have had their requests rejected and are to be kicked out of our Member States – contravenes everything that goes under the name of the dignified treatment of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to hear more about the subject addressed by Mrs Smet in paragraph 17 concerning women’s participation in the agreement process. We have recently had experience of this in our committee, both where Afghan and Iraqi women are concerned. Almost nothing at all has been done about their participation, in spite of the fact that we have all said it is an important matter. I should also very much like to hear Commissioner Patten’s comments on paragraph 19, to the effect that the Commission should address these issues in all the relevant forums, such as G8 meetings and WTO rounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not everyone in the various states is giving your report a joyful welcome. It may escape many of us that, in the context of international relations, and particularly where development cooperation is concerned, it was not so long ago that discussion of human rights was absolutely taboo. In the past, we were apparently always so kind to each other that, during negotiations, people did not even say what they really thought of situations in certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What we now have before us is therefore very much a radical departure from this. I hope that in future, we will have a women’s rights paragraph when negotiations are started in certain countries. We often hear that human rights are women’s rights. It should be self-evident that women’s rights are a vital component in development cooperation. In every culture across the world, women play a specific and decisive role in social, economic and cultural development and in social progress. In my experience, it is in the fight against human trafficking, and particularly the fight on behalf of the victims, that this need for a strong women’s policy becomes evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this report important, and why should it not become a document that pays mere lip service? I would immediately remind you of the situation of women in various future Member States where women are still being traded like pieces of furniture. Looking a little further, we see the Balkans, where, in certain parts of Albania, the Kanoun, the people’s legislation, continues to be in use to this day. That text, the Kanoun, the code of laws of Lek Dukagjin, states that a woman is nothing more than a sack that is made to last for a certain amount of time, comparable to a product with a sell-by-date. And that in the context of women’s rights in 2003! Another example is the person in charge in Ghana, who told me that women yield more than tomatoes. Why should we not trade in them in that case? It may be a good idea simply to send this report to a host of embassies, consulates, and people active in international affairs, so that people become aware of what it contains and will consider the fact that a women’s rights paragraph is a human rights paragraph, and is of vital importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Claeys (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> I too would like to congratulate Mrs Smet, even if it is because she has managed to draft a report about genital mutilation in women, about public corporal punishment, about stoning, crimes for reasons of honour and forced marriages, without using the terms ‘Islam’ or ‘Muslim’ once. You will have to forgive me for being sarcastic, but I can only deplore the fact that it is apparently deemed politically incorrect to call a spade a spade and to penetrate through to the heart of the matter, even when we are dealing with a very complex problem, namely that of the fundamental failure to respect women’s rights in a large part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is remarkable in places for its euphemistic use of language, which, again, I can only regret. For example, it mentions a cultural heritage as a result of which men occupy a privileged position, or traditional views and stereotypes are imposed on women, but nowhere in the document is it named. We have to ask ourselves who, in fact, stands to gain from such misplaced diffidence. The cultural relativism that is so prevalent in Europe these days stands in the way of a correct prognosis of the problems and, as such, constitutes more of a barrier to any fundamental solution. Not every Muslim fails to respect women’s rights, just as not every Muslim is a fundamentalist. Reality, though, indicates that the oppression of women has, unfortunately, become the norm in Islamic states and in countries where Muslims make up the majority of the population. The seriousness of the situation may differ from country to country or from region to region, but discrimination against women is mainstream in the Islamic world and is, as such, not related in any way to the existence of fundamentalist, so-called minorities. I realise that this is not a comforting thought, but, on the contrary, a reason to implement the measures mentioned in the report with even more determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I can largely identify with Mrs Smet’s report. As she rightly stated, when treaties are concluded with third countries, it is not sufficient to provide for clauses with regard to sanctions. These sanctions must also actually be imposed when violations of women’s rights are established and if the local government condones, tolerates or even imposes them. The report very rightly points out that the European Member States must ensure that all forms of violence against women must be recognised and punished within their own legal systems. Genital mutilations take place even on our own soil, and in that connection, there is a related form of the problem that deserves our attention, namely surgery to restore the hymen. Demand for such operations is growing rapidly and I can predict that discussions will follow about the question whether social security should soon start to fund the preservation of such backward customs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has apparently decided to give the issue of headscarves, the very symbol of women’s oppression in Islam, a wide berth. You only need to jump on the metro in Brussels, Paris, or take the underground in London, to realise how popular the headscarf is compared to some ten years ago. The radicalisation of Islam is not simply something that is taking place in Pakistan or in Egypt, but also in our own large cities. Europe should therefore send out a forceful message that our standards and values, such as the giving of equal rights to men and women, are not up for discussion, and neither should they be. Those who are unwilling to accept this are no longer welcome here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The time came for an initiative to deal with these grave violations. Mrs Smet has put forward a very good report, which also encompasses types of suffering; psychological, physical and sexual suffering. I support her demand that in future there must be clauses to stop EU aid when women’s right are continually and systematically violated. They should be integrated into trade and development agreements with third countries, or bilaterally or multilaterally within the framework of the WTO. If positive steps are not taken to prevent violence against women then that must result in sanctions and these agreements being frozen.</p>
<p class="contents">International indifference on this issue is embarrassing. This applies to countries such as Afghanistan, where for years the Taliban demoted women to second-class citizens, as well as Iran, where there are serious offences against women.</p>
<p class="contents">Non-Muslim states are among them too, though, Mr Claeys. To obtain more information about this the Commission should establish contacts with institutions and non-governmental organisations at national, regional and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">International conferences and talks and – Commissioner Patten – a yearly statement by the Commission on the regression and the progress are further important steps. We must make politicians and the public in the countries affected more aware and more vigilant. These types of violence must also be prosecuted with greater determination in the EU. We have had solutions for years but they have not been implemented. My fellow-Members who spoke before me have also mentioned this.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Member States case law must be changed on this issue, genital mutilation must be banned and trafficking of women must be fought more determinedly with the cooperation of Europol and Eurojust. The priority, however, is that women are able to use all resources so that they can enjoy their fundamental rights without any discrimination.</p>

At a time when a woman who fights for human rights, and women’s rights in particular, has just been awarded the Nobel peace prize, at a time when serious discussions are taking place regarding a more coherent global development and finding solutions to conflicts, let us again take this opportunity, albeit very late in the day, to highlight the very specific situation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year thousands, even millions of females suffer violence in every possible form. How many silent voices are there behind the statistics, how many aspects are disguised or hidden behind the non-interference clause or the cultural heritage argument?</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union we say that human rights should come before any custom or social philosophy. However, when we are talking about international relations, which is the subject of this report, there is often a clash between two world views. Should we be content with acknowledging but not hearing what these women are asking for, either in their own countries or in seeking protection through the international law that we support? So how much scope do we have to state that we condemn these practices and that we are not being fooled?</p>
<p class="contents">The instruments mentioned in the report are proof of the outstanding pragmatism of women in general, and in particular of Mrs Smet, who I would like to congratulate on her work. We must reaffirm that any violence against women is in itself sufficient grounds, <span class="italic">sui generis,</span> for granting the right to asylum and refugee status. In response to this discriminatory violence, we need to use the violence of economic sanctions, unless we have an order of priorities in which women have a much lower value than cooperation agreements or firm traditions with a very sad history.

However good intentions are all the report contains, and the annexes on the cases of half a dozen countries where these types of practices take place speak for themselves.</p>

Trade rights prevail over women’s rights. In reality, these barbaric practices are being continued with the collusion, at least from a passive point of view, of supposedly civilised countries. Moreover, if the European Union wants to claim to be a champion of women’s rights and be credible, it first needs to show that it is capable of making all of its Member States recognise the fundamental right of women to control their own bodies, including the right to abortion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Historically, the very concept of international relations has really excluded women. As Professor Cynthia Enlow, one of the eminent authors in gender and international relations, describes, the value of women's experiences in war, marriage, trade, prostitution, factory work or domestic chores has been ignored by world leaders and on the international level.</p>
<p class="contents">This in turn has led to classical international relations being one of the most gender-blind forms of political analysis. Women worldwide still earn less than men even here in the European Union where the gender pay gap still cuts across all sectors, have less access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities and are often denied full political and economic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women often stems from this very discrimination, though women are not seen as equal to men. In turn, gender-based violence is legitimised and women's human rights are denied.</p>
<p class="contents">Women should be entitled to the right to life; the right not to be subjected to torture; the right to equal protection in times of international or internal armed conflict; the right to liberty and security of the person; the right to equal protection under the law; the right to equality in the family; the right to the highest standard of physical and mental health and the right to just and favourable conditions of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in European Union countries we still see that violence against women is treated unfairly. If I take Italy – which at the moment holds the presidency of the European Union – as an example, in February 1999 the Italian Supreme Court overturned on appeal, a court verdict which had found a male driving instructor guilty of raping his 18-year-old student. The Supreme Court noted that the victim was wearing jeans at the time of the offence and stated that jeans cannot even be partly removed without the active cooperation of the person wearing them. The court decided that the victim had consented to sex and concluded that the rape was not proven. With these kinds of attitudes, the emphasis on women's rights being integral to human rights is vital. As my Spanish colleague said, at the moment they are merely seen as an aside, rather than being integral to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender considerations have to be taken into account through gender mainstreaming. We should welcome the Commission's initiatives. However, there is always more that can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative to include a clause in the 2003 budget which states that the lack of action to prevent and combat severe violence against women, such as stoning, public castigation, genital mutilation, burning and rape will constitute a reason to suspend EU assistance must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">In Kenya, in one particular community, the incidence of genital mutilation was as high as 97%. Wife inheritance continues, and experiences of rape and domestic abuse are rife. In Pakistan, the Human Rights Commission estimated that in the year 2000 a woman was raped every two hours and hundreds of women were victims of honour killings, domestic violence, burnings and murder.</p>
<p class="contents">As you start to explore the nature of violence against women, and the European Union's role in international relations, there are pressures we can place to help to prevent these atrocities from happening. We have an opportunity to make international relations wake up to their responsibility and recognise women. We have responsibilities in the European Union to uphold women's rights across the globe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think, in particular, men should participate in this debate because this is an issue which concerns not only the women in our society but the whole of society. We are all diminished by the fact that so many millions of our citizens of the world are still denied basic human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly supportive of paragraph 13 of Mrs Smet's report which urges that refugee status be given to those women who are threatened with the kind of violence that has already been outlined here. It is a sad fact that in my own country – and I believe in other European countries – the threat of genital mutilation or stoning or honour murders are not a basis for granting refugee status. That has to change if we are serious about making it clear that we stand for the human rights of all.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's development aid programmes should include programmes which seek to ensure that women can participate fully in society. I have to say I disagree with Commissioner Patten in relation to the trade agreements. We are quite fortunate that we have a person of the calibre of Commissioner Mr Patten doing this task, and it is clear that he has a commitment to women's rights and human rights generally. But I am afraid the evidence is that the approach so far has not made significant progress in ending the practices which are so prevalent in developing countries. I think that we have to begin to toughen up on the need to apply sanctions or suspend agreements if we are going to make progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Those we are making agreements with have to appreciate that we are serious. I am not talking about suspending agreements at the drop of a hat. But where there are persistent violations of human rights in relation to women's rights and children's rights, we have to demonstrate that we are serious about our commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
