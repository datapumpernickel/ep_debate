By 30 April, each Member State must decide whether they are going to open up their labour market or not. This decision will determine whether this year will actually be the year of workers’ mobility, or a parody of it. We cannot tolerate a situation where workers from new Member States continue to be second class, and in certain respects even third class players on the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms, a fundamental idea of the European Union. In the course of the March summit, the European Heads of State or Government will discuss the Lisbon process. The Lisbon process is bound to fail if we do not create a unified and flexible labour market. And this cannot be achieved without the liberalisation and freedom of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recently published an assessment which showed very clearly that the fears and anxieties persisting in the old Member States are groundless. There have been fears, for a long time, of a massive influx of workforce into Great-Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, the three countries that have opened up their labour markets. This has not happened. The rate of unemployment has not increased in these countries, against all expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, ‘black work’ was reduced, public revenue increased, and the competitiveness of companies has improved. Illegal employment is still considerable in countries that continue to restrict their labour market. This has led the Commission to the unequivocal conclusion that the winners of this process have been the countries that have liberalised the movement of workforce from new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So far I have been talking about the fact that the second class citizens on the labour market are the citizens of the new Member States. However, since 23 January, they have actually become third class citizens in a certain respect, because this was the date when the Directive stating that the European Union shall grant the right to employment and residence to third country nationals who have been residing legally within the territory of the European Union for at least five years came into effect. We do not have any problems with this. But this means that even these nationals are in a more advantageous situation than the workers from new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I ask the Commissioner: how does he envisage the rectification of this problem, how can it be ensured that workers from new Member States do not feel like third class citizens on the labour market? And at this point I would like to welcome the decision of Finland, Spain and Portugal. These are very positive decisions for the liberalisation of the workforce, but we are waiting for France, the Netherlands and Belgium to join in and liberalise their labour markets, as this is in the interest of everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, first of all, the Accession Treaty provides for a nuanced approach and clear solutions which allow both the long-term residents directive and the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers to be applied in full legal compatibility. Let me explain this in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the question of first-time access to the labour market. In such a case the Accession Treaty – during any period in which any old Member State applies transitional measures – provides that it must give preference to nationals of the new Member States over third-country nationals as regards access to the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The second situation concerns nationals from the new Member States who are already resident in an old Member State. In that case the Accession Treaty again provides that nationals of new Member States who already reside and work in a Member State applying transitional measures must not be treated in a more restrictive way than those from third countries also resident and working in that Member State. This means that where by virtue of the directive, a third-country national has been given long-term status, the Accession Treaty operates so as to ensure that the old Member States must treat citizens from new Member States who are already legally resident and working in the territories at least according to the standards guaranteed in the directive – thus including the right of free access to the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The same logic also applies in the third situation covered by the directive: movement by long-term residents between Member States. Here the rule is the following: workers from a third country who are long-term residents in a new Member State should not be treated more favourably than nationals of that state. In other words, in the situation of mobility to a second Member State, an old Member State cannot give free access to its labour market to a long-term resident who is a third-country-national if and where the same free access is not given to a national of a new Member State. The same applies to equivalent situations between two old Member States. In both cases of mobility between Member States, if both the national of a new-Member-State and the long-term resident are subject to national measures such as a work permit, Community preference would operate in favour of the national of the new Member State, who is a European citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">From the above, it results that the rights provided by the directive can be reconciled with the provisions of the Accession Treaty. There is no need to submit proposals to change the rules, because it is impossible to have less favourable treatment for citizens of the new Member States of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees, however, that there is a need for better information clarifying the issue to be sent to the Member States and I intend to do this by sending all Member States a letter clearly stating the existing rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question concerns the issue of the free movement of workers from new Member States, and seeks an answer to whether, within the current regulation frameworks, certain groups of non-EU nationals are enjoying considerably more advantages than citizens of new Member States in respect of movement between Member States for employment purposes. If this were true, then this situation would be obviously wrong, and we would have to rectify it, to avoid any prejudice to the preference principle stipulated in the status quo clause of the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Article 21 of Directive 2003/109/EC stipulates that third country nationals who have obtained long-term residence permits in a second Member State shall have access to the labour market. The expression ‘shall have' must be interpreted to mean that the issue of a work permit cannot be denied if the persons concerned have already obtained the right to long-term residence.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, a long-term residence permit issued in the second Member State practically includes the work permit. This means that if companies in the target state are willing to accept them, the access to the labour market of non-EU nationals arriving from other Member States is automatic and unrestrictable, while the access of citizens from new Member States is unequivocally restricted and restrictable.</p>
<p class="contents">We must obviously welcome an objective that aims to achieve greater mobility and a more flexible and more unified labour market. This is the obvious aim of Directive 2003/109/EC, too, but attention must be paid to the right sequence. I personally welcome the argumentation that I have also heard from the Commissioner, and would like to call attention to the fact that we need more than just a letter – we need some kind of a procedural regulation that explains what exactly needs to be done when a third country national and a European Union citizen are in a competitive situation. What I mean is that we need more accurate and more detailed guidance, and this is what I would expect from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope that it ends as soon as possible, so that all Europeans may be equal and so that we may make the mobility of workers an important tool in terms of our competitiveness, our employment and the construction of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to join with those people who are calling for an open door policy, and the sooner the better, and in this regard I believe — and, as a Spaniard, I am pleased about this — that my country’s government’s announcement that the restrictions during this transition period are to be lifted is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done this, Commissioner, because we are a country with a degree of experience, being a country of immigration and one of emigration. Furthermore, we have seen clearly once again over these two years that these restrictions imposed on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Europe of 15 must be lifted, for reasons of justice and solidarity, but also for reasons of rationality and common sense, today more than ever, in this year of mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">We must firstly look at this from the point of view of justice and solidarity. We Spaniards also had a seven-year transition period and we felt humiliated and unfairly treated as a result of a situation that was not justified, because it became clear that many of those xenophobic and racist arguments were mistaken. There was no avalanche of workers. Spanish workers never created problems in the host countries; on the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen the same thing happening over the last two years with the workers of the new Member States: not only have they not created problems, but they are in fact resolving labour shortages, improving their skills and enhancing the global concept of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would ask, therefore, is that the study carried out by the European Commission should serve to persuade more countries to lift the restrictions and that the day should come when Europe is genuinely a Europe in which all European citizens and all European workers have the same rights, because that would be consistent, because it would be very good for mobility and because Europe needs mobility if it wants to win the productivity and competitiveness battle with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to create that great market of free citizens in which there will be no problems and which, furthermore, will enable us to improve our competitiveness, to improve our capacity and to improve the lives of our citizens, so that, as well as resolving specific problems, we may create something of a vision for the future in terms of removing those obstacles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no need to explain why citizens from the new countries should gain access to the labour market – quite the contrary, in fact. It is the countries that continue to protect their markets that have to explain why they continue to deny fully-paid-up fellow EU citizens their basic rights. It also makes good economic sense, of course, to lift the restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European economy and the labour market need people. If we, in the European Union and its internal market, want to compete with major markets outside Europe, we will need dynamic, young, well-trained people who are also mobile. That is something to which we have always aspired within the European economy, and so it makes no sense whatsoever to keep the labour markets closed off. Moreover, it is an illusion that these restrictions stop Eastern European workers from coming over here, for they have been around for a long time, even though they are being exploited by fraudulent employers and live in degrading circumstances in our countries – something that I regard as a disgrace.</p>
<p class="contents">Considerations of civil rights, the economy and solidarity therefore require that the restrictions be lifted. I am pleased, then, that my own county, the Netherlands, will probably do that – at any rate, it appears that a majority is in favour of it – and I should like to urge all Member States, in the year of mobility, to do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that one way to achieve popularity is to tell people things that are not true, particularly if you tell them that the transitional rules can protect the labour market. Yet the opposite is the case; the transitional rules do not keep migrant workers out. Instead, since they cannot become employed legally, the black economy is the only option left to them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the border regions of Eastern Germany, from which I come, the black market is burgeoning and there has been a massive increase in fictional self-employment, quite simply because the transitional rules encourage these things. As a result, higher wages come under even more pressure. Unlike in the case of legitimate employment, illegal employment is not capable of being controlled and monitored. That results in workers being subjected to exploitation and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed in Europe is a well-ordered labour market with minimum standards and underpinned by the principle of the same pay for the same work in the same place. The effect of transitional rules is, quite simply, to put off to another day these urgently-needed reforms and efforts; more than that, they give the populists of the Right material for their speeches, and most of all, they undermine the European ideal. Let me, then, as a German, make my appeal for the transitional rules not to remain in place, but, instead, for the market to be opened up in Germany too and for proper conditions to become the order of the day there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, the countries of the so-called old Fifteen are bound to ensure that long-term residents receive the same treatment as their own nationals as regards access to the labour market. On the other, many of these same countries are taking advantage of the provisions of the Treaty on Accession and maintaining the ban on free movement of workers where the new Ten are concerned. This state of affairs is contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned Treaty on Accession, pursuant to which European Union citizens have priority over third country nationals regarding access to the labour market. The problem could have been resolved by doing away with the transitional periods for the employment of citizens of the new Member States in the labour markets of the old Union. Unfortunately, only three Member States, namely Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom opened up their labour markets from 1 May 2004. Two other Member States, Spain and Portugal, have stated that they will do so from 1 May of this year. Sadly, in most of the other Member States fear of the anticipated influx of cheap foreign labour and consequent loss of jobs has won the day. Mrs Schroedter mentioned this in the case of Germany. Such fear is entirely groundless. The European Commission’s statistics show that in most countries the number of citizens of the new Member States employed has remained fairly stable before and after enlargement. With the exception of Austria, the figure for workers from the 10 new Member States employed has not exceeded 1% of the economically active population. In no Member State of the Union has it been the case that the influx of workers from the new Member States has ousted local workers from their jobs. The new arrivals have been taking completely new jobs or previously unfilled positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we need to realise that the US economy will continue to outstrip ours in terms of competitiveness unless we increase the mobility of the labour force in Europe. Unemployment in the EU currently stands at over 8% but even so, there is a shortage of workers in certain areas. Meanwhile, not all Europeans can move freely in search of work. Regrettably, it is very likely that the greater part of the Union’s labour market will remain closed to citizens of the new Member States for a further five years. That is why it is essential for the European Commission to take action to eliminate the contradictions in Union legislation and to extend the free movement of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I called on them to open up their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States. Unfortunately, only three Member States were courageous enough to open up their labour markets at that time. I refer to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. The remaining 12 Member States gave in to the fears or maybe even the pressures of their own public opinion and citizens and barricaded themselves against an influx of workers from the new Member States, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. What conclusions can be drawn after these two years? Clearly, those who have benefited the most are the very same three countries that dared to open their labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission communication issued about a month ago, in February if I am not mistaken, makes it very clear that unemployment has not increased in countries that decided to open their labour markets. Social problems have not either. What has happened is quite the opposite. The economy has gathered additional pace, and income from taxation has increased. Such are the benefits of the practical implementation of one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty. It could even be deemed the most fundamental of them all. It is part of the foundations upon which the Union is built, and we should be striving to implement it across the 25 current Members of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the expiry of the first transitional period I am delighted that a couple more governments are reconsidering opening their labour markets. It must however be pointed out that the way things stand, they still constitute a minority of the old Fifteen. This is a serious problem, and I should like to send out the following appeal. As we each take the floor in the near future to debate Parliament’s resolution, we should send out a clear call to the governments of Member States not simply to consider opening up their labour markets. We should appeal to them to go ahead and open them fully to allow the free movement of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, who has prepared an excellent summarising report, presenting an accurate and authentic picture of the labour market processes in the past period.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of Hungary and of the other new Member States is to see that all legal and administrative obstacles currently hindering the free movement of workers in the European Union are lifted. We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union. Opening up the labour market and ensuring the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour, but the reasonable decision of the nine old Member States, which would have beneficial effects on all the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the competitiveness of the European Union that is at stake. I hope that nine old Member States will realise this, and that in April 2006, at the end of the two-year transitional period, the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision, joining Finland, Spain and Portugal, who are opening up their market now.</p>
<p class="contents">We must thank the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who were the first to open their market. This step has brought a significant advantage to these countries. In the Republic of Ireland, the rate of unemployment has fallen in the past two years, partly due to the positive effects created by workers from new Member States. In the United Kingdom, the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness. Consequently, the accusations and fears related to mass immigration and social dumping are simply unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks to Finland, Spain and Portugal, who have announced that they, too, are opening their labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries, but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States. At this late hour I need to argue with Commissioner Frattini. What he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market. In those countries it is, indeed, possible to give priority to workers from new Member States over workers from third countries. In countries that have not opened their labour market, this issue does not even arise. Therefore, opening the labour markets is a matter of principle, of competitiveness and of eliminating discrimination, as well as a matter of equality between the fifteen old and the ten new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms which is guaranteed, but as yet only declared in European Community law. The new Member States expect the European Union's old-timers to open their labour markets to the newcomers as soon as possible, believing that the old-timers will only benefit from this, although it is the sovereign right of each one of the old Member States to do this before it actually becomes compulsory. According to European Commission statistics, the flood of labour from the new countries was not as great as had been threatened. Having admitted workers from the new members, England, Ireland and Sweden only benefited. We must congratulate several states on their decision to open their labour market to the new members of the European Union from May. The free movement of labour, the liberalisation of the services market and other measures would contribute to the competitiveness of the European Union, and moreover, it would increase citizens' faith in European Union membership. The clarity or ambiguity of a complicated situation reduces faith in the European Union. In my opinion, members of the European Union must take measures to immediately abolish discriminatory restrictions to legal employment faced by the citizens of Lithuania and other new Member States. This would allow people to truly benefit from their rights and would give them the opportunity to pay taxes legally. It is time to break the stereotypes of the old way of thinking and to understand that freedom and healthy competition are the engine of progress in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would point out that where the new Member States held the competitive advantage, the markets remain closed. One example is the services market, and the labour market could serve as another.</p>
<p class="contents">From 23 January, following final implementation of the directive concerning residents, the situation regarding access to the labour market by third-country citizens may actually be better than that of citizens of the countries that recently joined the Union. I found your explanations interesting, Commissioner, but they failed to convince me. I think the House should hear more on this subject. All this is in clear contradiction to the provisions of the Treaties on Accession. It is worth emphasising yet again to the House that not one of the countries that opened their labour market has recorded an increase in unemployment or in other social problems such as benefit fraud. On the contrary, the cheaper labour force from the new Member States has reinvigorated the economy. Two years down the line we can state categorically that there is no economic justification for these restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to the Commission’s plans, this year is the European Year of Workers’ Mobility. It should be emphasised that low worker mobility is also related to the closed labour markets in most of the Member States. If Member States insist on maintaining the unjustified closure of the labour markets, 2006 may well turn out to be the year of European hypocrisy rather than the European Year of Workers’ Mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is vitally important that we should make it abundantly clear that the four freedoms are among the fundamental rights of the European Union, one of whose principles is the ban on discrimination. The four freedoms are at the heart of the internal market; their implementation makes it a domestic one. These EU principles – the political goals – are clear, and they unite us. We must implement them as soon as possible; the reason why we have not yet done so is that our policies are subject to different framework conditions, to different social legislation, different wages, different tax legislation, different labour laws. With 19 million unemployed, we have differing growth rates, which are – thank heavens – higher in the new Member States than in the old ones. The result of this is fear and worry on the part of the public. Not least in my own country, which has the longest external border with the new Member States, there are more and more citizens of the new Member States in the workforce. </p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do, though, is look into the Treaties and Community law for ways in which we can take public concerns and fears into consideration. Rather than standing in the way, we are seeking acceptable transitions, but transitions are not our goal; what we are aiming to do is to make the four freedoms a reality, to lay fears to rest and join together in seeking joint solutions. Rather than apportioning blame, we need to meet each other halfway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This matter is meant to be handled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but this debate, and the question on this point, are pre-empting its deliberations, and that I really do think is something we can do without; there may be reasons for it, but it is, I think, something we can do without.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by saying that the Commission communication, which is meant to help do away with the transitional period for the free movement of workers, is, I think, still defective in terms of its substance and – in the form in which it is presented to us – not yet watertight in economic terms. Nor are the authors of today’s question looking at the facts from the right angle when they talk in terms of the citizens of the ten new Member States being put at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the nationals of third countries. The fact is that, in Germany, people from the ten new Member States are 3% more likely to be in work than those from third states. In Austria, the difference stands as high as 6%. The advantage enjoyed by the ten new States is even more pronounced in Great Britain and Ireland. More to the point, data relating to only one year since accession cannot serve as a credible basis for a prognosis of medium and long-term changes in the labour market of the kind that the Commission is putting forward. </p>
<p class="contents">When one considers the period to which the evaluation refers, the conclusion at which the communication arrives, namely that the opening-up of the labour market has a positive effect on economic growth and employment, is quite simply wrong. In 2005, there was markedly less economic growth in the EU of 25 than in 2004. This was particularly the case in the United Kingdom, where there was a 1.4% decline and where immigration was ten times greater than the British Government had predicted. In contrast to preceding years, there was also scarcely any reduction in unemployment, and so I call on the Commission to commission, as soon as possible, a study examining worker migration and all the effects associated with it, and doing so in a value-free way.</p>
<p class="contents">That will be beneficial not only to the Commission, but also in terms of continued rational dialogue. I would add that, while I too would like to see an early reduction in the transitional periods, that will require good accompanying measures in a suitable framework, and the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive. That would be to the benefit of all concerned, in that it would allay one side’s fears and concerns, and make both sides better able to engage in dialogue, but the sort of debate we are having today I regard, quite simply, as wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The old Member States must come to a decision on the extension or abolition of the transition period. The United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden opened their markets immediately and benefited, and at the same time encouraged the new Member States to view their own labour in a somewhat different light and evaluate it better. The job market of EU-15 has not been flooded by labour from the new states. Expansion has encouraged the legalisation of previously illegal jobs. No transition periods will stop a person who wants to leave. A person's freedom of movement is the cornerstone value of the European Community. On 26 January, a Council Directive entered into force allowing the citizens of third countries, who have lived in the EU for five years, to move freely, come to study, work or simply live in any EU country. Why did the Council adopt a Directive which is discriminatory with respect to the new countries? Why is there such huge opposition to restore justice? It is good news that Finland, Spain and Portugal plan to abandon the transition period. Austria and Germany initiated the introduction of the transition periods. The results of the two years have shown that the new states do not pose a threat. I urge Austria and the other remaining states to abandon the discriminatory transition period and this discriminatory view of the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will begin by mentioning the Services Directive. It was feared that the new Member States would start to offer services of a better quality than in the old Member States, and this resulted in the blocking of the implementation of one of Europe’s fundamental rights, which for fifty years had only existed on paper. There was offensive talk of the movement of services constituting ‘social dumping’, and the mythical <span class="italic">plombier polonais</span> was invoked to frighten citizens of the old Member States. This rhetoric humiliated the new Member States and left their citizens with the impression that they were not human beings. The conflict was not, however, between left-wing and right-wing forces, and the old Member States quickly found a compromise among themselves: some defended their large companies, while others protected their trade unions. But Eastern Europe opened up its market long before it joined the European Union, and as a result large companies from the old Member States have for years simply bought up companies in Eastern Europe without the constraints of a services directive. They came to our market and bought it, but when our turn came, the door was closed. It is the small companies and citizens of the new Member States, as well as consumers in the old Member States, who suffer as a result of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the restriction of the free movement of labour makes the new Europeans into second-class citizens. Some citizens of the EU are entitled to move freely, while others are not – on the basis of their citizenship. Neo-protectionism in the EU limits the civil rights of citizens of the new Member States, often using xenophobic rhetoric, as we noticed in the case of the debating of the Services Directive. Although the labour market is closed, the old Member States have for years gladly picked out those workers they lack – for instance, doctors, nurses and IT specialists. They would not consider insulting these workers by branding them with the label of dumping, because their recruitment is often even funded by state subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have now seen the implementation of a directive stipulating that non-citizens who have lived in an EU Member State for five years are entitled to freedom of movement, but citizens of the new EU Member States lack that right. What can one conclude from this? Citizens of the new Member States are not only second-class, but even third-class citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is this: what action does Europe plan to take to ensure that this intolerable protectionism and obvious discrimination does not split the newly reunited Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Migrant workers have helped eliminate labour market deficiencies, increasing the skilled labour force in the EU, decreasing the potential for illegal employment, and contributing overall to better efficiency in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">A month ago we debated and approved in the first reading a report on opening the services market in the European Union. I am mentioning the Services Directive because a point may come when it will touch closely on the freedom of movement for workers. A critical moment could be reached if, on the one hand, the Services Directive becomes effective and, on the other hand, a country still chooses to frustrate the free movement of workers. This would impose constraints on workers in their desire to switch employers, even though such changes would benefit not only themselves but also the destination country. A country may eliminate this risk by cancelling the transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in itself the free movement of workers is, of course, not a solution for sustaining the social model of a given state. Inefficient models cannot be sustained in the face of the deteriorating public finance deficits that result from globalisation, technological change and ageing populations. The free movement of workers, however, is definitely not, and cannot be, the source of these problems. European legislation cannot dictate to the Member States whether they should or should not cancel transition periods. These states, however, should take every measure to tackle the true causes of their economic problems. They will then view the free movement of workers as an advantage and not as a threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The open borders policy in Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden has proved to be a success.
