What we have here is a classic example of European work. First of all, Parliament came up with a pioneering proposal as regards which the Council then needed four years to establish a common position adopted by the 15 Member States which was characterised by exclusively national interests. Parliament then required the Council to think in European terms at second reading, while the optimum demands were made on behalf of artists and auction houses. Finally, a solution that everyone involved considered to be acceptable and satisfactory was found following tough negotiations with the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have put European competition in the art market back on track, while auction houses and galleries in the EU are being given equality of opportunity. In this context, I think it is particularly important for the Commission to also look regularly into the issue of whether – and, if so, when – the European art market, and not only national art markets, are affected, and that corresponding adjustments are made. We have improved social security for artists and their heirs, who have now also been uniformly guaranteed a financial stake in the increases in value of their works.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we have, in this way, taken a first important step in the direction of more competition and more security in European art circles. I must ask the House to approve the result of the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One Member State has not applied it and three Member States have not yet had recourse to this mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Since existing legislation differs greatly, not just as regards its specific objective but also with regard to the rates applied and those entitled to receive royalties, this situation represented a gap in the internal market. The compromise reached by Parliament, the Council and the Commission seeks to bridge this gap and to bring an end to the distortion of competition from which the Community is currently suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the resale right represents a fair return for artists or their successors, since it compensates for the fact that the laws of the art market dictate that a work of art usually only gains value over a period of time, whereas artists cannot wait for their twilight years to be able to live from their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the resale right is a form of tax on financial speculation in the art world. It is a tax that the art market can easily bear, as is proven by the introduction of a special VAT system on works of art in Directive 94/5, a special system which has not prevented an increase in sales quite the opposite not even in Member States which did not operate a VAT system.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has said all that was necessary with regard to the compromise reached, which I personally supported. In this compromise, the European Parliament made two essential gains:</p>
<p class="contents">- on the one hand, the threshold subject to resale right was brought down to EUR 3000, which is still quite high, but which could be brought down further if the Commission believes this is necessary. This becomes more acceptable insofar as a Member State resale right is maintained below the European threshold;</p>
<p class="contents">- on the other hand, the refusal to have an extremely long deadline of 15 years; this was retained by the Council of Ministers in the text adopted after first reading and has now been brought down to a maximum of six years. This precedent would have been set at a particularly inopportune moment, at the very time when the Community is preparing for its enlargement to new members.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the external art market is under no illusion as to the importance of the draft submitted today for the vote by Parliament, there is, therefore, no real reason to reject this draft text, and that is why our group will be voting for the motion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the conciliation committee and Mr Zimmerling for their efforts. But unfortunately, I shall have to adhere to my old point of view. The vast majority of my group are still not happy with the proposal. We are concerned here with the difference between the English term ‘copyright’ and the Dutch word ‘auteursrecht’, for what is at issue here is the sale of a work of art.</p>
<p class="contents">Should an artist’s heir be able to exercise his or her rights seventy years after the event? I do not think so. A sale implies that all rights and duties are waived, and that is what the financial compensation is for.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestion to increase the minimum price to EUR 3 000 is an improvement. Anything lower would seriously hamper budding artists.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my next point of criticism. Our main objection to this proposal is that it is diametrically opposed to the principle of subsidiarity. The Commission has been unable to demonstrate that discrepancies in legislation in the Member States will, in the long run, have a direct, negative impact on the internal market. Furthermore, it is quite likely that the European modern and contemporary art market, which is of particular significance for London, will be moved to Switzerland. This was, in fact, already evident a few weeks ago at the Basel Art Fair. The art market could, in fact, move outside Europe altogether, where this right does not exist. Surely that cannot be the aim of the exercise. It appears from the proposal that that is a problem. Provision is made for all kinds of unnecessary exceptions. Harmonisation has therefore gone out of the window. Is it not a contradiction in terms that, whilst attempts are being made to harmonise resale rights worldwide, the opportunity is being created for the Member States to abandon the minimum price at will via all kinds of loopholes?</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is implementation. In addition to the red tape which is involved in keeping track of the different sales and purchases of a work of art, exceptions complicate the matter even further. Artists do not welcome this either. If the sale takes place between private persons, resale rights do not apply. Would you not agree with me that the trade in art between private persons will experience a dramatic upsurge? That is not the only example I could quote.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the directive does not offer all artists the same treatment, except in the case of sales via galleries and auction houses. The directive is unclear and is not fraud-proof. It is also superfluous, for there <span class="italic">is</span> no distortion within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">My group does not welcome legislation of this kind. The citizen experiences this, in fact, as unnecessary interference from Brussels. My group has voted against it twice. It deems the changes and improvements in respect of the proposal to be insufficient and will therefore be voting against it for the third time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A majority of members of visual artists’ associations and representative bodies, with whom I have spoken during the last few years, now want to see European resale rights. Even the majority of those in the art trade want to see common resale rights. Politicians have been trying for years to negotiate a compromise acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, the Council has not really striven for harmonisation but, rather, put together a framework with a number of ingenious loopholes. Admittedly, the Council was not particularly flexible and did not pay very much attention to the European Parliament’s proposals, but it is, at the end of the day, an acceptable compromise. I cannot speak for the Commission, but there are one or two things to indicate that the Commission, too, was not happy, or in agreement, with all the Council proposals, especially those regarding the transitional periods. In what was not so much a debate as a veto policy, the Commission, too, played its role, however, in making resale rights possible. Now we have this document, on the subject of which I would say that, although we might well protest, we ought to be saying ‘yes’ to what is, at long last, a victory. We have this paper, which can be improved upon, but it is precisely because we now have the paper that such improvements can be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Opponents should be somewhat more careful in their criticism rather than appear, as critics, to be all of the same mind. That is because there are some people who reject resale rights on principle and others who would like to level specific and very serious criticisms which may be of vital importance to themselves or to particular players, for example to the smallest art galleries which, in fact, are instrumental in creating a pool of talent. It is they who assume the major risk. They have a great many problems with the tax differentials, administration and insurance contracts. They are scarcely allowed to take visual artists’ work on commission. For the most part, they have to buy such works.</p>
<p class="contents">If these smallest galleries have to buy works of art and are then – as anticipated in this proposal – unable to resell them three years later, and if perhaps, only after that period, have to sell them for less than their purchase price, they are bearing a risk and are losing out on two counts, namely in terms of both the price and of the resale rights. My group will nonetheless vote in favour of this proposal, although there are still one or two improvements to be made in terms of both resale rights and of related aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should not like to brush aside one further argument, for that is not something I can do, but, rather, to qualify it somewhat. It is only one specific lobby that is arguing the point about market migration. We have supply and demand, and there are certain things that are sought in Europe, and which have always been sought in Europe, and not in the United States, and vice versa. It is important that this European decision, which will hopefully be taken by a majority of us tomorrow, should exert enormous pressure in favour of representatives campaigning for resale rights in Switzerland and also in the United States. They are waiting for us to say yes, and I hope that this is what they will hear tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, although this measure aims to remove distortions in the internal market, it is fair to say that there is no such thing as a Community market in the resale of artists' work. There is in fact a major market in the UK – mainly in London – and very little else in Europe. Therefore, the major effect would be not so much to distort as to disrupt the UK market. The net result of this will be to drive the trade elsewhere: to Japan, Switzerland and the United States, none of which countries will have the same concern for EU-based artists as the London market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, such money as is collected will invariably go to the wrong people. Seventy per cent of the <span class="italic">'droit de suite'</span> funds collected in France in 1996 went not to the artists but to the descendants of seven artists, including the relatives of Matisse and Picasso. This does not exactly conform with the images of helping the struggling artist.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the law itself is cumbersome and will add considerably to the costs of art markets by adding a tier of bureaucracy and expense. Many small firms will be excluded from low-value sales altogether, limiting the opportunities for new and aspiring artists to market their works. Instead of helping artists, this will hinder them, and there will be fewer small firms left in business. Who will then buy the works of unknown artists? Altogether this is an ill-conceived, irrational and ultimately unnecessary piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation itself will be the instrument which creates distortions in an otherwise satisfactory market. As is so often the case, Parliament and the European Union should leave things alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement was criticised by some artists’ groups who told us they believed that the new directive would, paradoxically, cause unacceptable discrimination between famous artists and those who are in difficulty, that it would give no support at all to artists who need it most. They pointed out to us that, in fact, this would create a distortion between a minority of privileged artists, whose works are sold in art galleries and auction houses, and the majority of artists, who would be officially refused the resale right since their works of art are sold privately or sold to museums by private collectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, as you might imagine, we had lengthy debates on setting a threshold of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 4 000, above which the resale right would apply, arriving at a compromise of EUR 3 000, which is a reasonable amount. What is more worrying, on the other hand, is the exception to the rule of equal opportunities in law, which could well lead to appeals before the Court of Human Rights in Luxembourg due, in particular, to the fact that the date on which the directive will enter into force in Member States which currently do not have a resale right is so far away 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I am afraid that, as the previous speaker said, the resale right itself although it clearly responds to legitimate concerns will create bureaucracy that is more likely to cripple the art market than to bring genuine satisfaction to the creators themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of this, a good many more members of my parliamentary group also have reservations, shared by political colleagues in my own country of Austria which, at present, does not have resale rights at all and has not seen any need to introduce them either. I also promised my French colleague, Mrs Fourtou, that I would again voice some of these reservations today, although I am a committed supporter of fair competition in the internal market and always speak up for European regulations whenever they make sense in terms of the internal market and our common integration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On 13 December of last year, I therefore informed plenary of the concerns expressed about resale rights by artists, the art world, gallery owners and, above all, young artists, as well as by the auction houses in my own country and by our parliamentary group. On that occasion, I concluded by saying that the present basis for the decision was unsatisfactory. I certainly think that the conciliation committee made a lot of changes to try to accommodate these reservations. Moreover, the rapporteur is also to be congratulated. For many, these misgivings could not, however, be completely resolved, something which finds very clear – albeit only symbolic – expression in the wordings concerning the transitional regulations, such as the following: ‘The deadline for implementation of the directive will be 4 years. Those Member States which do not apply the resale right at the time of the entry into force of the directive shall not be required, for a period expiring not later than 1 January 2010, to apply the resale right for the benefit of those entitled under the artist after his death.’ A further deadline is cited by way of supplement. This wording shows how sensitive the subject is and how various compromises had to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say, however, that the purpose of introducing resale rights is to enable practitioners of the visual arts to benefit from the subsequent financial success of their works. We must ask ourselves if this goal has been achieved. Partly in the wake of scientific investigations and, in addition, the conclusion reached by the conciliation committee, many believe that resale rights constitute a redistribution of resources from young, and often less well off, artists to older, successful artists and, above all, to their heirs. One of the investigations I have to hand provides a very good five-point summary of the reservations, which I should very probably point out, since they show that not everyone is now in a state of euphoria.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: since the art and auction trade can only bear a very small part of the resale rights tax and since – thankfully, in my view – this tax cannot be fully passed on to the purchasers of works of art, resale rights might lead to a reduction in the purchase prices of works by young artists.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that artists successful later on in life – perhaps just a few out of the total number – might regard resale rights as an enforced redistribution of resources in those later phases of their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this is an undesirable development, however, since it would confine young artists within a world of consumer opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the tax could change the nature of competition in the art trade. If this were to happen, there could be a real risk of migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the initial sale price might be influenced by account having to be taken of the fact that, in the event of a subsequent sale, the resale rights tax would be payable to the artist.</p>
<p class="contents">These reservations are also shared by many in my country and in my parliamentary group. That does not detract from the result of the conciliation, but I would ask you to understand that not everyone today is laughing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And what we have created are resale rights for the figurative arts. These rights are property rights because they vest economic rights and benefits in the artist. However, they are property rights <span class="italic">sui generis </span>because they indirectly recognise the importance of aesthetic values while, at the same time, awarding artists a sort of honorary tax. It is a fact of life that works of art cannot be bought and sold without the intervention of art dealers. However, unlike the trade in consumer or other capital goods, the trade in works of art is not an end in itself. The point about the art trade is that it disseminates aesthetic values and aesthetic messages. But these messages cannot be disseminated without artists. And while their contribution is unique, the works which they produce only gradually acquire a market value. It is therefore wholly unfair for the dealer – who is no more than a middleman – to reap the full benefit of this value. Besides, it is up to them to encourage artistic creativity.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is wrong that artists in certain countries do not recognise this right. We therefore need to correct the mistake in the Berne Convention making resale rights potential rights. The fact that certain countries insist on long transitional periods or on postponing the date of application does not flatter its supporters. Europe, as the area of artistic creation and culture <span class="italic">par excellence</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>must show third countries the right way forward.

Indeed, there is some evidence it may actually make them worse off, as my colleague Mr Karas pointed out.

Those jobs are our jobs – Europe's jobs – and our businesses. On balance, we believe it will damage rather than enhance Europe's economy and the position of its working artists. Moreover, it will make a global agreement on <span class="italic">'droit de suite'</span> less rather than more likely because there is no incentive for the beneficiaries of this agreement – New York and Geneva – to strike a deal with the European Union.

<p class="contents">I shall be brief in my remarks; much has been said about this subject, not only today, but in the past, so I shall restrict myself to what is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The resale right is going to be part of Community law. It will allow artists to benefit from that right wherever their works are sold in the European Union. That means that an end will gradually be put to the distortion of competition affecting the internal market in this area. The directive will give the Commission a basis on which to act in order to promote recognition of the resale rights at international level. The Commission has already committed itself to taking appropriate action in that direction. But the Commission is still concerned by the long delays in application which may lead to 10 years elapsing before the directive is able to produce its full harmonising effects. The Commission has therefore made a statement, which is to be published in the Official Journal together with the directive, in which it points out that such delays should be considered exceptional and should remain so in order to maintain the effectiveness of Community action within the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
