<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive we are considering today is undoubtedly an extremely worrying problem; illegal immigration in its two particularly odious forms – on the one hand, the development of networks of smugglers who act for reasons that are far from humanitarian and, on the other, the exploitation of migrants in the trafficking of human beings. More precisely, this directive concerns the victims of trafficking and smuggling under these two types of offence, which must not be confused with one another.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key elements of dismantling networks that exploit migrants lies in obtaining information. The victims are in the best position to be able to provide this type of information to the authorities. And, without this information, the authorities will find it more difficult to combat trafficking networks. The aim of this proposal is therefore to strengthen the instruments for combating networks, by establishing a residence permit for the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings with arrangements that encourage them to cooperate with the competent authorities against the perpetrators of the offences in question, but avoiding any type of abuse in the way this mechanism is used.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be highlighted that, since trafficking in human beings and action facilitating illegal immigration are often interlinked, the scope of the text covers both offences, because these are basically parts of the same fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sörensen (Verts/ALE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, let me begin by thanking all those fellow MEPs who have contributed so much time and energy to what I think has been an extremely fruitful collaborative exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in mid-September, and in this Chamber, that by far the most important conference on the subject of trafficking in human beings to date was organised by the International Organisation for Migration and the European Commission. It resulted in the so-called <span class="italic">Brussels Declaration</span>, and in this <span class="italic">Brussels Declaration</span> you can clearly see the central importance of the directive that you have before you to vote on today. It is important to point out straightaway that trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings form an integral part of our economy today. It is essentially about treating people as if they were nothing more than merchandise. At the same time victims of trafficking in human beings are victims of a whole range of abuses and criminal practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in human beings has now also become the subject matter for committees, with nearly everyone seeming to want to take up a position on it. What is frequently overlooked is that trafficking in human beings is proliferating because corruption, along with indifference and disbelief, is proliferating. In a number of countries soon to become members of the European Union, parents sell their children in the hope of giving them a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive is a first and consequently important step towards eventual concrete action. The directive requires the Member States to issue a short-term residence permit to victims of smuggling of human beings or of trafficking in human beings who are prepared to cooperate with the competent authorities. The essence of the proposal is that, here, governments and the victims have shared interests, in particular that the criminal networks be shut down. For the purposes of this special directive, the Commission has taken trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings together. It is indeed the case that in purely legal terms they are two quite different things, but in reality the distinction is extremely difficult to make.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive is however based on thorough practical knowledge of experts active in the field. The experience we have acquired in Belgium for example proves that the instrument of a short-term residence permit does not miss its mark. Other Member States too have such systems, albeit with varying degrees of success. I fully support the Commission’s proposal and it is fundamentally important that its content remains intact. First and foremost this means that some of the amendments touched on by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are unacceptable, in particular, for me, Amendments Nos 7 and 27, for the simple reason that they tear the proposal apart. They turn it into an empty shell. Voting for these amendments will be barely concealed approval for the practices of organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to say is that this directive stands or falls by the minimum social provision for victims. A victim will never want to cooperate if he or she is not offered the beginnings of an alternative to the situation in which they currently find themselves. Allow me to say a few words on two other points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there are some who would want this directive to apply immediately to minors too. At first glance this seems a good idea, simply because we can never do enough for the extremely vulnerable position of minors. What is forgotten, however, is that what this directive is offering in the end is only a minimum. Minors are offered very much more today in all the Member States and it would therefore be a real step back if minors were only accorded such minimal protection and rights. This does not alter the fact that there is a real need for a special effort for victims who are minors.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say something else regarding a number of original amendments from Mrs van der Laan – Amendments Nos 20, 25 and 35. Her alert legal mind envisages the possibility that in certain cases contact between victim and criminal can be accepted by the authorities to further the investigation. It is a tempting idea, but it is a legal minefield in a number of countries. The risk of kidnappings or even of manipulation and intimidation is also very real. Victims willing to cooperate with the authorities want absolutely no contact at all with the criminals, not even from a distance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise that this directive sets aside a special place for specialised and recognised NGOs, but also for international organisations and government agencies. As Mrs van der Laan has likewise rightly said – and, although this, because of a technical error, does not appear in the text in front of you, it has been noted on the voting list – NGOs also have a special part to play as intermediaries between the investigation and prosecution services on the one hand and the victim on the other. It is also important in this regard to emphasise that where NGOs are concerned they must be NGOs recognised by the state. After all, anyone, even criminals, can set up NGOs. Or, as not uncommonly happens, NGOs can be infiltrated and manipulated. I therefore think that everyone involved with this matter should sign a code of conduct. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year, 120 000 women and children are lured into the European Union from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe alone. These figures do not take account of either illegal immigration or the smuggling of human beings. This highlights the urgent need for coordinated measures against this form of organised crime. The proposal for a directive, which provides for short-term residence permits to be issued to victims who cooperate with the competent authorities, is an important step. Up to now, there have not been any pan-European arrangements for dealing with the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings. However, we need common European standards if we are to combat this form of crime. The short-term residence permits proposed here will not undermine the current practice of deporting illegal immigrants. Instead, the authorities will be put in a position to obtain information and incriminating evidence from victims who cooperate, with a view to apprehending traffickers and smugglers of human beings and commencing criminal proceedings against them.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediate deportation of victims may improve the statistics, but it does not bring us any closer at all to achieving our objective of effectively combating organised crime, whereas short-term residence permits for victims who cooperate make it possible to identify structures, break up criminal rings and bring criminals to justice. That must be our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would once again like to thank Mrs Sörensen very sincerely for all the commitment she has put into this report. I would also like to thank the Commission and the other groups for their helpful cooperation, which I believe has led to a good end result in this report.</p>

The aim is therefore to issue a short-term residence permit to the victims of these networks who cooperate with the courts or the police. A measure of this kind has been in force in Belgium, the Netherlands and in Italy and has had a very positive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Sörensen, whom I would like to thank in particular, makes reference to the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Non-governmental organisations must play a greater role in assisting the victims of trafficking in human beings and we have strengthened the rights of victims by enabling them to submit an asylum application. It would be unfair to refuse them this right due to the fact that they often only have false identity papers. Let us note that it is essential that the Member States be required to protect the anonymity of victims of trafficking by only organising trials held in camera.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore on the verge of making great progress in Europe in combating trafficking in human beings. I would, however, draw your attention to Amendments Nos 7 and 27 which refuse the holders of a residence permit the right of access to the labour market, vocational training and education. This right was laid down in Article 12 of the Commission’s proposal. Deleting this provision would completely distort the directive. Victims who have no way out of their situation would have great difficulty in cooperating with the police authorities and would easily fall back into the hands of mafia-like networks. This initiative will make victims stronger and will help them to cut ties with their illegal past as soon as they have severed relations with the criminal network. Let us reiterate that the Member States are still free to make the issue of permits conditional upon victims’ participation in a rehabilitation programme aimed to encourage their integration in the host country or their return to the country of origin. We owe aid and assistance to the victims. This is how to ensure they remain law-abiding men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their longings are odiously exploited by all kinds of profiteers including those who transport these people to Europe and those who exploit their vulnerability within our own Member States. Many young women see their lives wrecked through prostitution and drugs. Others are exploited in hazardous occupations and are miserably remunerated outside any form of social protection system. People smuggling and trafficking in human beings must therefore be combated by every means available under the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive provides us with an additional opportunity to seize the big players. We naturally have a responsibility to help the victims and give them the opportunity of a better life. I believe that many of them may have reasons for remaining within the EU if they so wish, but that must happen through the customary channels. With the help of the victims, what counts is getting at the big villains. At the same time, a fair and sensitive balance must be struck between supporting the victims and tackling criminal activity – a combination of humanitarianism and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sörensen’s proposal improves the directive which can, however, be made better still. She herself mentioned a number of proposals. Of relevance in this connection are individual organisations and responsible state authorities, but what also matters is having the directive specify that victims be allowed access to the labour market, something which is not at present a part of this proposal. I want to second what has been said, to the effect that it clearly needs to be possible for people to extract themselves from the anxieties and serious problems that arise from their being so vulnerable. I want to thank Mrs Sörensen for a very good piece of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not like texts that confuse crimes against the individual with crimes against the state. We have had problems along these lines with previous directives dealing specifically with trafficking. Naturally, we need bilateral police cooperation worthy of the name. That, precisely, is one of the problems. Directives do not help, therefore. The majority of the people being dealt with at present are women and children who are being sexually exploited. I cannot support this report because of what I take to be its cynical approach to these people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The circumstances under which people enter countries illegally are tragic and degrading. All legal means must be used to tackle the criminals who show no mercy in their quest to earn big money. The means proposed here can make a contribution to this. Similar legislation for victims of trafficking in human beings was successfully introduced in the Netherlands some years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sörensen however immediately puts her finger on the weak point in the Commission’s proposal. The definition ‘victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration’ is unclear. She proposes following the lead of the UN protocol against smuggling of migrants and using the term ‘victims of smuggling of human beings’. The Commission is opposed to following this lead precisely in order to prevent misunderstandings. This directive in fact affects a different group of people from those in the UN protocol. The directive is only concerned with those who can reasonably be regarded as victims and who have experienced harm such as threat to life or assault on their physical integrity. I understand this reasoning, but think that the Commission’s definition will provide for at least as many misunderstandings. In effect we are talking about the same terms. The problem is just that the term must bring to the fore that the people concerned have suffered disproportionate harm.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sörensen tries to solve this by proposing the term ‘victims of smuggling of human beings resulting in exploitation’. This term does not fit the bill either however because what happens then to the physical harm the Commission is talking about? Both definitions threaten to lead to abuse of the regulation. The Council must consider carefully whether the offence of smuggling of human beings should be included in the directive in this way. Especially as legislation in this area exists only in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to note that the deletion of Article 12 does not seem to me to be a good idea. Access to the labour market, to vocational training and education is just one part of what this system should set up. If it is omitted, what reason does the victim then have to cooperate with proceedings against the smugglers of human beings and traffickers in human beings? It is precisely through the opportunity to earn a little money and to receive some training that in the end you give them more opportunities in their homeland and you also give the homeland itself more opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not forget that this encompasses the even more frightening phenomenon, which is often omitted and overlooked, of human organ trafficking. In this connection, my country’s legal authorities have already carried out many detailed investigations, especially with regard to the north-east border, which, in an irresponsible move, had its border controls removed a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the content of the resolution. Without prejudice to the fundamental reasons behind this approach, which, of course, should be endorsed – for precisely these reasons and because of the need to take concrete steps to clamp down on trafficking in human beings and the promotion of illegal immigration – we must not ignore the risk. The danger is that, through the practical application of these rules in support of those who cooperate, we may create clandestine means whereby the same organisations can, through false or perfunctory<span class="italic"> </span>cooperation, establish another method to bring persons into European Union territory illegally. It is therefore extremely important to limit the scope and legal procedures, and clearly delineate the legal procedures of this process, precisely in order to avoid delays being contrived and the possibility of re-entry.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to remember the victim of an horrific reverse race murder two years ago: a young Swede killed by racists in Salem, a suburb of Stockholm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Migrants put themselves in the hands of traffickers and smugglers of human beings because legal immigration into ‘fortress Europe’ is virtually impossible nowadays. That and that alone is the starting point for all this. That is why trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings happen in the first place, and it is because people who come here in this way are forced into acting illegally that they find themselves in a precarious situation. It is for that reason alone that it is possible to exploit them in the way that they are being exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">To that extent, I can say that I find the Commission's proposal honest at least, because the title itself makes it clear that this is about ensuring that any form of illegal immigration is made more difficult, rather than about helping the ‘clients’ of traffickers and smugglers of human beings. That is evident from the fact that this report also covers smugglers who do nothing apart from transporting people across borders in return for payment. That is why I have only this to say: if this really were a matter of helping people, which some Members have suggested to be the case, then we should be working to dismantle border arrangements in a consistent way and to guarantee that people have the freedom to choose where in the world they live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree with the amendments intended to clarify the system that has been proposed. I am referring here to simplifying the residence permit, to the possibility of extending the reasonable reflection period on the basis of serious grounds and to the need for the victim who has been issued with a residence permit to remain available to the competent authorities. Similarly, we can support the amendments specifying that the victim must be informed in a language they understand or that they can submit a request for asylum as well as the amendments stipulating that the decisions to withdraw or not to renew a residence permit can be appealed against and that the withdrawal of authorisation must have good reason. We also support the amendments that seek to clarify certain concepts, such as the seriousness of the offences referred to or the examples of vulnerable persons.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, support the proposals that eliminate the granting of social benefits such as access to the labour market, to vocational training and to education. We are talking about short-term residence permits and these measures will not only have a major economic impact but will above all provide an important incentive for cooperation with police authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we feel that minors must not be included in the common rules. The provision of a specific framework that guarantees greater protection for minors, who are particularly vulnerable victims, is of the utmost importance. Lastly, we believe that giving victims the opportunity to maintain relations with trafficking networks in order to work as informers could have terrible consequences. We must be aware of the power of these networks, of the vulnerability of the victims and of the risk that such a solution would entail.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we cannot accept the amendments which, although reasonable and well-founded, appear to exceed the legal basis of this instrument: I am referring to the protection of privacy, to the identification of the victim in a court case and to the recognition of harm suffered and compensation for this, which are covered in other texts, both at European and at national level. I wish once again to thank Parliament for the support it has given this Commission initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
