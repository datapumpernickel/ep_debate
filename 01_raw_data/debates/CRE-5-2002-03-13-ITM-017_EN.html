Our thanks are due to them. They are always there and help us in Europe to understand each other better, and to get on better with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have before us the question on parental responsibility that we have tabled. We as a legislature should not lecture people about how to run their lives, but we do need to help them find the right path through life. We need to make that right path possible. That is why the European Union has pledged itself to honour fundamental rights, both in the treaties and in the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have now been co-existing very well for over 50 years. Peace has reigned between very different societies, but within families there is often conflict when love is shattered. Generally, it is the children who suffer. In such cases we then read in the newspapers about children being kidnapped by their own parents or being unable to develop properly because of the pressure they are under. We should not pretend that these things are not happening, and we have to recognise that what are apparently merely family arguments between a few individuals indicate problems with a European dimension. Ultimately, it is the rubbing points in cross-border judicial arrangements that grind down families and children. That is what we need to put a stop to. That is why our question to the Commission includes points that we have identified in conversation with the people affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Our question includes proposals for solving the legal problems and facilitating judicial cooperation for the benefit of children. I do not want to read out the details again here, Commissioner. You have had a chance to read them and I would be pleased if you could agree with each of them. You would be doing a great many people a service if you were to do that and if you were to make it clear to even more of our citizens that Europe is more than a legally defined area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Please take this opportunity to make it clear, together with the European Parliament, that Europe is an area in which people can feel secure outside their own borders, even if there has been conflict between partners. That is why – and our question relates to these three things – we need clear and comprehensive legislation, properly motivated lawyers who jointly implement legislation with a common understanding for people, and, last but not least, good common fundamental concepts. I hope that you can also satisfactorily answer this question for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I will, of course, do my best. The Tampere European Council identified visiting rights as a priority in the creation of a single judicial area where decisions can circulate freely from one Member State to another. This priority responds to the social reality of people increasingly relocating from one Member State to another with families breaking up and reforming.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member has said, the Commission is now working on a new proposal that brings together the Commission proposal on parental responsibility of September 2001, the French initiative on rights of access of July 2000 and the Brussels II Regulation. We expect to be able to present this proposal in April 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As was the case with the Commission proposal and the French initiative, the aim is to fashion solutions that build on the mutual trust inherent in a common judicial area to best protect the child. This means going beyond the balance struck in the Hague Conventions while, at the same time, recognising their value in addressing international situations. To this end, in November 2001, the Commission presented a proposal on the signature of the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully shares your concern about making progress fast. This now appears possible, especially in the light of the recognition during the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Santiago de Compostela in February 2002 of the need for a Community-specific solution giving the final say in cases of child abduction to the Member State of the child's habitual residence with the Member State to which the child has been abducted being able to take provisional measures only. We trust that this work will continue to benefit from the support of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members are perfectly correct in pointing out the importance of mutual trust between national judges for the execution of decisions issued in another Member State. For several years the Commission has, through the Grotius and Grotius-civil programmes, continuously supported projects aimed at bringing together judges from different countries to improve mutual understanding of legal systems between Member States. A significant number of these projects have focused on family law.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for such projects will continue to be available through the new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters, to be adopted by the end of March. The new programme, which will apply from 2002-2006, will be endowed with higher budgetary means than the previous programmes. You may wish to know that, as concerns the implementation of the new programme in 2002, the Commission is considering giving priority to training for legal practitioners on Community instruments in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters, including, for example, the Brussels II Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the new programme will also allow for direct actions taken by the Commission to ensure the sound application and implementation of Community law. Such actions will, needless to say, also cover instruments in the family law area.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention should be made of the European Judicial Network in civil matters, which will be operational towards the end of the year. The network will also facilitate mutual understanding of the legal systems of the Member States, as well as providing a means of identifying and solving problems related to judicial cooperation in civil matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission considers that the necessary instruments – as concerns judicial cooperation in civil matters, including the family law area – are already in place to reach the objectives the Members refer to.</p>
<p class="contents">Building on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all actions relating to him or her. As has been pointed out, the ‘best interests of the child’ is a fluid concept that is open to different interpretations and ultimately rests on the appreciation by the judge of all the elements of the case at hand. A multidisciplinary project that sheds light on the state of play as regards the different conceptions of the ‘best interests of the child’ would usefully complement our work by promoting mutual understanding of legal systems and thus reinforcing the requisite mutual trust for the free circulation of decisions. Such a project would be eligible for financing under the above-mentioned new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As rapporteur I hope very much that I will receive the tidied-up proposal which is due in April. It has been mentioned in the question as well. The problem is that there are quite a number of serious practical problems that we have to deal with. For example, Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Berès sit on a particular committee in France dealing with these issues. I understand that there are, at this very moment, about 50 outstanding cases. The biggest problem – from the case-load I have – seems to be where parents are denied visiting rights by the custodial parent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to list, for the record of the House, the active cases I am working on at the moment. Mr Eric Comet, whose children are in Finland, was granted custody by the courts in Finland. This custody he could never exercise. His children no longer wish to see him. In Sweden we have two cases of fathers seeking visiting rights to their children: Philippe Paquay and Kevin Willoughby. In Germany, believed by most people who work in this area to be the country where most of these difficulties exist, we have Mr Guy Foster and Mr Chris McMullen; and probably one of the best-known cases of all, Lady Catherine Meyer, the wife of the British Ambassador in Washington, who has seen her two sons for precisely 24 hours in the past six years.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands we have Mr Morales-Gouvenne and in Austria we have Noël Dumont. The problem is that particularly in Germany, social workers seem to be able, under German law, to make decisions about access and custody which, in some cases, take no note of decisions made in courts in other countries. In very many cases, the judges involved have perhaps only one case of this sort throughout their working life and are therefore unfamiliar with what the Hague Convention and hopefully now this new regulation will entail.</p>
<p class="contents">We still see – and unfortunately this is at the heart of most of these cases – parents using their unfortunate children as weapons in the war between the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mentioned the Hague Convention of 1996 which, thankfully, was recognised last November. However, it has not been signed by any Member State, nor by the Community. This is causing serious problems because at the heart of that legislation is the recognition of the right of every child to know and have access to both its parents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They need policies to be implemented. If the Commission indeed wants to make the mobility of European citizens one of its priorities in order to harmonise and promote the European labour market, it should face facts: we will also need European family law within the European judicial area.</p>
<p class="contents">Experts have been working for years on drawing up these texts and are despairing of ever being able to mobilise policies. We need to take this task in both hands, and I think that this oral question can contribute to that.</p>
<p class="contents">What European law should we draw up? There are the mechanisms of the Hague. There is certainly a particular place for Community law, for law of the members of the European Union. From that point of view, I would like to draw your attention to a few difficulties. The first is that through European law we should not call into question the principle of the authority of the judge of the resident country. This is an inviolable right if we wish to face up to the reality and resolve conflicts in a harmonious manner. There is the possibility of developing networks of trust. This is essential, otherwise automatic return, which is what should be standard law in the European Union, will never come. You mentioned some programmes for developing those trust measures. Use them. We need them in order to promote exchange, so that when a French judge rules on a child custody case, on return after abduction, he will not be tempted by the nationalist reflex. Neither the French judge, nor the English, Irish, German or Finnish judge. There is also the hope that came from the Informal Council meeting in Santiago de Compostela, which was a positive sign. But as it is the details that cause the problem, it is essential that the conditions for the return of children be respected. Whether it is after an abduction or after exercising rights of access or rights to have a child to stay for a limited period, the return should take place according to the law of the country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to ask you for clarification on the third part of our question: what do you think of the idea that the Commission could launch a working group in order to have a discussion between Europeans of the tricky notion, which pollutes many of the judgments, that of the interests of the child, which we have included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have heard a reference to abduction, but of course abduction takes many forms and can be subtle. Mrs Banotti has raised the issue of a constituent of mine, Mr Guy Foster; and allow me to summarise the case because it concerns real human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Foster has been denied access to his child ever since his German wife returned to Germany with the child following their divorce. The agreement was for the mother to have the right of abode over the son and for Mr Foster to have full visiting rights. However, once in Germany, the mother neglected the child and spent time in psychiatric care, and the child was subsequently placed in the care of its maternal grandmother.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite Mr Foster's persistent attempts to contact his son, he has been cut off from him ever since, unable to speak with or visit him because the mother and maternal grandparents have withheld information. A court made a decision on this case, but he was given information about the court appearance after the date. Documents were served in a foreign language. The handing over of care to the grandmother was thus allowed to proceed without Mr Foster being able to represent his views. I believe he has been denied and is still being denied the fundamental right to see this child and has been denied access to justice. This is surely wrong in the eyes of those of us who believe that we should always serve the best long-term interests of the child.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gebhardt referred to two key words: help and enable. We are fifteen different Member States with different languages and different cultures, but we must never use language as a means of excluding people from the debate or denying them their rights. Therefore, I urge the Commission to take action, to be imaginative at Community level and at Member State level to ensure mutual recognition and judicial cooperation, and to put an end to these tragic human cases, which have consequences beyond our own time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Mrs Gebhardt began by saying that Europe is an area in which people feel secure. Indeed, security was the <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> for what has become the European Union today. The pioneers sought to make a peaceful Europe and they, of course, succeeded. Nowadays, we are at peace and people expect to be safe, but too often the European Union is accused of meddling in things that are not important and too much of what the European Parliament appears to do is irrelevant to ordinary peoples' lives. Sometimes we discover a real area that needs legislation and yet we are powerless to act. As Mrs Banotti and Mr Cashman have pointed out, this is an area that needs legislation and where, I believe, European action would be positively welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The cases of access we have heard about; in which parents are denied access to their children, are desperately distressing. They make the misery of separation even worse. Being separated by time and space, by hundreds of kilometres and expensive flights, is painful and distressing for parents and children.</p>
<p class="contents">President, Commissioner, over the years Parliament, the Council and the Commission have all worked to secure a common market for goods and capital, fair trade and free trade for those with money. Now we need to make certain that we have, a fair market and a free trade for people so that families and children can work and move around with rules that are fair, rules that work and European institutions that enforce them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cashman said that the European Union is fifteen countries. He is right, but with the addition of ten or twelve more countries in the pipeline, I shudder to think of the possibilities in this area if we do not act and do not succeed in getting legislation that works – legislation that will make the European Union safe and secure for all its citizens, children and parents alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Banotti asked if the proposal the Commission has announced for April will be available. It will be. Any other course would definitely not be in the interests of the Commission, so we look forward to presenting it and discussing it. This is how we shall proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Berès asked whether I had forgotten the third part of the question concerning the child's interests. I repeat the final phrases of my first contribution, namely: A multidisciplinary project that sheds light on the state of play of different conceptions of the best interests of the child would usefully complement our work by promoting mutual understanding of legal systems and thus reinforcing the requisite mutual trust for the free circulation of decisions. Such a project would be eligible for financing under the new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters. We see this as a way of moving the issue forward. I have noted with great care and interest the different contributions in this discussion and we have moved it another step forward this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
