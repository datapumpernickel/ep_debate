The aim of this regulation is to provide the European Maritime Safety Agency with the funds it needs in order to properly fulfil the new role assigned to it with regard to combating pollution caused by ships.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the intention is for the Agency to have responsibility for this area over the long term, this text defines a financial package to be attributed to the Community budget on the basis of a multiannual commitment. The Agency will only be able to fulfil its role effectively if it has financial security based on a multiannual commitment. The aim of the proposal for a regulation is therefore to establish procedures for the Community contribution, which has been set at EUR 154 million – the reference figure for 2004 – for the period 2007-2013. The proposal provides that the resources made available to the Agency are intended to cover all of its anti-pollution activities, as listed in the action plan that it adopted in October 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Of these activities, I should like to draw particular attention to the operational assistance given to Member States that want to strengthen their national mechanisms to deal with pollution, using specialised ships, specifically standby ships equipped for the recovery of pollutants from the sea, which the Agency will make available to the Member States. Another activity is the development, alongside aerial monitoring, of a satellite imaging service that will make it possible to detect pollution and thus to help the Member States to combat the illegal dumping and accidental spillage of hydrocarbons. Yet another activity is the development of a response capability for accidents involving noxious and dangerous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank your rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for seeking, and reaching, Mr President, an agreement with the Council at first reading. This constructive approach between the two institutions should enable us to adopt this regulation quickly, to give us a viable system for combating pollution at Community level without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to extend my warmest thanks to Mr de Grandes Pascual and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their efforts. The compromise you have reached clarifies the Commission's proposal in a number of areas. Therefore, Mr President, the Commission fully supports and accepts all of the compromise amendments proposed by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention; I am now going to listen closely to the thoughtful comments of the various speakers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Luis de Grandes Pascual (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner responsible for transport, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking all of those Members who have improved the quality of this report through their amendments in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. For my part, I have tried, through dialogue, to reach a fundamental consensus with everybody who has shown an interest in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as you have quite rightly pointed out, Commissioner, we have maintained a fluid and fruitful relationship with the Commission and the Council, which has resulted in compromise amendments that will make it possible to approve this report at first reading. There will therefore be no delay in the measures planned within the context of the new tasks entrusted to the Agency with a view to combating pollution caused by ships more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall very briefly mention the most characteristic aspects of the report. Firstly, we are talking about a regulation of a financial nature, which will make it possible to implement the Agency’s new tasks on the basis of a multiannual commitment of seven years, covering the period 2007-2013, in accordance with the new financial perspective. The new tasks assigned to the Agency are intended to increase maritime safety and prevent pollution caused by ships in Member States’ waters. The size of the commitment was initially set by the Commission at EUR 154 million, a sum that was consolidated by Parliament in the financial perspective and maintained without any cuts in the interinstitutional agreement reached last May. I must point out that that sum was initially indicative and that now it has the consensus of Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It is the minimum appropriation necessary for the Agency to carry out the new tasks assigned to it.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that the purpose for which the Agency has been created is to provide an appropriate framework for carrying out concrete actions aimed at increasing maritime safety and preventing pollution from ships in Member States’ waters, and also to provide the States with additional resources when national response resources are insufficient to deal with a large-scale incident. I must therefore say once again that the Agency has not been created in order to replace the actions of the Member States, but rather to act when the countries affected have insufficient resources to deal with disasters and to complement their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The additional resources that we are talking about essentially consist of the long-term chartering of ships by means of stand-by contracts with commercial ship operators that have vessels of sufficient capacity that can be adapted for pollution response purposes. In response to a request for assistance from a Member State, such vessels would interrupt their customary commercial activities in order to deploy to the area in need.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the criteria for selecting priorities for the deployment of ships by region, as a result of the amendments presented and the agreements reached with the Council, the Agency will have to pay particular attention to regions that have been declared the most vulnerable, due to their greater susceptibility to accidents or deliberate pollution, given their characteristics and previous experiences. The Agency will, however, be able to assist in any other region within Community waters which needs help and which requests it.</p>
<p class="contents">The contracting of the first stand-by oil recovery vessels – a total of seven – was carried out in 2005 via a restricted tender procedure. Before the end of this year, 2006, the second tender procedure will have been concluded. This time, the Agency wants to conclude four new contracts for ships that will prioritise the two major Atlantic regions and the Mediterranean region. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this should be the opportunity to fulfil our commitment to Galicia. In any event, before beginning the contracting of stand-by vessels, the Agency will first carry out an inventory of the resources of the Member States, in order to ascertain how best to complement the needs of the Member States that the Agency must cover.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that my objective of broadening the scope of the regulation, so that the Agency can deal with pollution by noxious substances, and not just oil pollution, has been achieved. Consensus has been reached in this regard through the use of the term ‘pollution caused by ships’, in order to describe pollution caused not just by oil, but also by noxious substances.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth pointing out that it has been agreed that the Agency should play a key role in coming years in the development of a centralised satellite imagery service for surveillance, early detection of pollution and identification of the ships responsible, increasing the availability of data and the effectiveness of the response to pollution caused by ships.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am pleased with the consensus reached by the three institutions with a view to increasing transparency in the management of the resources given to the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). In the past, we have seen other agencies accused of acting rather opaquely and outside of parliamentary control. In order to prevent such dangers, it has been agreed that, independently of the four-yearly assessment laid down in Article 7, the European Parliament should be regularly informed about the financial execution of the Agency’s resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that the new transparency practices will increase the Agency’s prestige, preventing it from acquiring the image of a purely bureaucratic instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, ladies and gentlemen, by asking you to support this report, which has not just been my work, but is the result of the participation of all of the political groups and of the consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If, though, its responsibilities are to be extended in this way, this must go hand in hand with the allocation of the necessary funding for the long term. No agency can do a proper job of work if it does not have enough money. The Commission’s proposal for the sum of EUR 154 million over the seven-year period is very realistic, being based as it is on the experiences gained in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes back, though, to a time when EUR 58.5 billion more was meant to be allocated to Category 1A. The whole category from which the EMSA is funded was cut down to 71%, although the EMSA is not affected by this cut, as the old amount still applies. Do not misunderstand me: the Committee on Budgets takes the view that the EUR 154 million constitutes the minimum that should be allocated to the EMSA to enable it to cope with its additional functions.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Budgets would have been happy if the members of the lead committee had taken exactly the same view, had supported us in our approach and had incorporated this into the regulation, for our position is that, if the Community fails to allocate sufficient resources, it is doing no more than wasting money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Τhis result gives us all satisfaction because it expresses the will of the European Union to give visibility to the European Maritime Safety Agency for combating pollution, to give it suitable means and adequate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">It already has important responsibilities, as the Commissioner and the rapporteur have mentioned, in supporting the efforts of the Member States to combat pollution and in providing the Member States with suitable information in connection with the prevention and combating of pollution and the evaluation of their policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, within this framework, in addition to this support, the Agency can also play a coordinating role, which is something that our past experience has shown we need.</p>
<p class="contents">The sum of EUR 154 million is important, not only because it is an adequate sum, but also because it also offers security over seven years. As far as operational support is concerned, the Agency has – as already mentioned – already chosen the way in which it will act to prevent and combat pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that we emphasise that, beyond these areas relating to the Baltic, the western approaches to the English Channel and the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, which are priority areas, the Agency can, if necessary, also act in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the Agency has the facility to deal with all substances. I should like to ask the Commissioner if we could programme an extension to its duties or if we could give a broader interpretation, so that the Agency can act in cases where pollution is not caused by ships, such as pollution from the major oil slick in Lebanon, which is currently plaguing the Mediterranean and approaching the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that that is what we are establishing by means of this regulation for funding action in response to maritime pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">As has frequently been said, we regard EUR 154 million from 2007 to 2013 as the very least that is required, and we will also, over this period, look carefully to see what improvements might have to be made. I can assure Mrs Haug that we are already keeping an eye out to see that nothing is wasted and to ensure that, on the contrary, it is properly funded and is taking the proper steps.</p>
<p class="contents">What it clear is that the Member States will not be discharged from their responsibilities. All the EMSA can do is to support them and supplement what they do. It has to be emphasised that maritime pollution is not just something that happens as a result of disasters. We know about the ‘Prestige’ and ‘Erika’ disasters, but our seas are being fouled day in and day out by illegal discharges of oil; if the environmental protection organisations are right in their calculations, these happen 3 000 times a year in European waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Something must be done about this, and I very much hope that the satellite monitoring system that the EMSA is to help set up will enable us to make a better job of dealing with the criminal acts in our waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cause for rejoicing is that the rapporteur, who was rather unwell before the summer, is back with us again, so that we can, so to speak, join with him tomorrow in getting this regulation on the road, and that he has, together with the Council, managed to come up with some good solutions, for which we are very grateful, and we have got this done and dusted at first reading stage, with no need of a conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, our adoption of this regulation tomorrow will see this House and the Council making an important contribution towards clean and better protected seas in Europe. I hope that this demonstration of Europe’s concern for clean waters will lead the public to value the European Union more highly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is fair to recognise that we cannot demand that each and every coastal Member State, regardless of its size or wealth, permanently have available sufficient physical and technological resources to respond immediately and effectively to major disasters and accidents. We should also remember that ships do not just transport goods to and from the coastal States, but that they are also part of the supply and trade chain of the other continental or non-maritime States, and therefore the latter should bear a degree of shared responsibility in terms of the risks involved in maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, Community measures should and must be taken in order to support and complement those established by the various Member States individually, though those States must remain primarily responsible for both preventing and responding to marine pollution. Amongst those support measures, the European Maritime Safety Agency is establishing a system for the collection and analysis of information on pollution caused by ships, which would include photographic surveillance by satellite, scientific-technical assistance and operational assistance, by means of ships spread out in different geographical maritime regions and ready to act in the event of accidents and disasters at the request of the Member States affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The present regulation is intended to provide funding for the next seven-year programming period 2007-2013 to cover the costs of these new services. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the proposal with the compromise amendments shared with other parliamentary groups, and we congratulate Mr de Grandes on his good report and the work he has done in order to reach a consensus so that this regulation can be approved at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to say, for my part, that I am convinced that the greatest maritime pollution is not caused by accidents and disasters, but that there is a great lack of environmental awareness; certain unscrupulous people put their economic interests first and deliberately and wilfully clean out their ships’ tanks and bilges at sea. Satellite photographs may reduce such cases, but I doubt that they will be of any use on cloudy days or when visibility is poor. I would therefore advocate the introduction on all ships of automatic mechanisms for controlling the levels of tanks and bilges at short, regular intervals in order to ascertain whether or not they have been emptied into the waste facilities provided in ports under the MARPOL legislation. This should be obligatory, just as the black box is for aircraft and the tachograph is for lorries. This would be the best way to put an end to deliberate discharges of pollutants, which I believe to be the most numerous and damaging sources of pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That summit took place only a month after the accident involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> in November 2002. Now, almost four years later, it seems as if the level of ambition has fallen considerably. There is too little money, and it is not completely clear how comprehensive we shall have been able to make the system. That being said, we are pleased that this compromise has been reached, and we support it. We would also particularly congratulate Mr Grandes on his report, and, as a Dane, I have to say how constructive it is that we have had the arrangements extended also to cover the North Sea area.

I do not believe that the proposal is good enough to enable us to prevent behaviour like that, but I hope that it is good enough to be improved and that it can therefore operate as a necessary framework.

<p class="contents">According to information from the International Maritime Organisation and other competent agencies, tens of thousands of tonnes of oil leaked into the sea and have spread along the shores of the Mediterranean to a distance of over 170 kilometres. The murderous attacks by the Israelis caused the death of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians and caused incalculable repercussions on the local environment in general. This is a crime against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of the cleanup operation in the area, according to the most moderate estimates by International Maritime Organisation experts, runs to more than EUR 50 million, in other words one-third of seven-year budget for funding the European Maritime Safety Agency to combat maritime pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not mention this in the sense that the cleanup operation will be covered from the Agency's reserves, but so that we have a better understanding of the real cost of this sort of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">The much-vaunted European Union principle of 'the polluter pays' is proving to be false and hypocritical, given that, in this case too, the European Union has not made any reference to those responsible, to Israel, which caused this huge ecological disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Maritime Safety Agency cannot and must not replace the International Maritime Organisation and its members, who bear chief responsibility for the safety protection of life at sea and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Agency needs to focus its action on improving maritime safety and combating pollution, concentrating its attention in particular on preventing pollution. The Agency must help with additional measures rather than replace the infrastructures and activities of the Member States; it must complement their action in dealing with disasters. The activities covered by financial assistance must include all forms of maritime pollution, especially pollution from hydrocarbons and dangerous liquid substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The take-up of EUR 136 million from total appropriations of EUR 154 million being given to the Agency to charter standby ships and the huge cost of satellite photographs, with 1 000 photographs costing EUR 1 million, mean that there is a huge risk of this Agency turning into a purely bureaucratic mechanism.</p>

This is certainly the kind of issue in which national self-interest can be harmful. Economic areas can and must continue to be exclusive, but the sea is a common good and when there is an environmental tragedy it affects all of us. The right way forward is therefore for us to adopt a Community perspective to address the risks of maritime pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report correctly points out, and I take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur, what we need is a sustained, long-term financial framework that will deliver prevention for the Member States and enable them to use up-to-date, appropriate technical resources to protect our coasts from spills, such as those that have happened in the recent past. Furthermore, and equally importantly, the framework will lead to punishment for those responsible for environmental crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, oil spills are always harmful and are sometimes criminal, yet financial spills can be harmful, too. Throwing money at the sea is not a solution in itself. I therefore support the multiannual funding model proposed here, and most importantly, the transparent, effective use thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 154 million allocated to the European Maritime Safety Agency for 2007-2013 will hopefully help to implement the action plan to combat maritime pollution, to set up a framework of specialised stand-by vessels to take action in the four priority zones and to set up a satellite image service centre to support the activities of the Member States and the Commission in the fight against spills from vessels, among other tasks in the fight against pollution. This is a project which, with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and others, has our full backing, not least because it reinforces the idea that the Member States have a shared responsibility in this joint effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are not living in a <span class="italic">Mare Nostrum</span>, as the Romans would say; nowadays, the sea belongs to all, and is a global, shared responsibility.

This Agency was created following two great disasters – the oil slicks caused by the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> – and from the beginning its task was to assist coastal States in dealing with disasters, should those States so request.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say in this regard, Commissioner, that in my region, Galicia, on the Atlantic coast, which has suffered in particular from great disasters over the last twenty years, the location of the Agency’s stand-by ships for recovering oil felt like a kick in the teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, even though the Commission expressly acknowledged that the area most affected by large-scale oil slicks over the last thirty-five years had been the Galician coast, with more than seven slicks greater than 10 000 tonnes, of the seven anti-pollution ships contracted by the Agency, not a single one was located in Galicia: five in the Baltic, one in the Mediterranean and another in the English Channel-North Atlantic region.</p>
<p class="contents">To be fair, however, I will also say that one of the commitments that this Parliament extracted from the Commission after the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster was the presence of an anti-pollution ship based in Galicia and in this regard I must say to Mr Barrot that the fluid dialogue with the Commission, both with the Director-General for Transport and with the Agency itself, has helped to allay our fears.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 13, which divides the Atlantic coast into two regions, as Mrs Ayala and myself had requested, Mr de Ruiter’s visit to Galicia and the good communication that has been established between the regional government and the Agency provide us with a guarantee that the European Union’s commitments to Galicia with regard to the location of an anti-pollution ship on the Galician coast will be fulfilled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commissioner and our rapporteur for their excellent work on this matter, but it is only a start. The best cure is prevention. We, in Scotland, an oil-producing maritime nation, have a live debate on proposals to transfer oil from ship to ship at sea, in an area of special scientific interest covered by the Birds Directive, the River Forth, just north of Edinburgh. This is an area precious to Scotland's natural environment. There is almost total opposition to these proposals in Scotland and yet the United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency just yesterday gave its approval for these potentially disastrous plans to go forward. Fortunately, the EU can take a bigger view. Commissioner Dimas has launched an investigation into the potential environmental consequences of these proposals and I hope his investigation will stop these proposals from being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome and support the Commission's proposals, they are a start. I believe we can go further. I believe my Group wants us to go further still. These proposals are stopping a disaster from happening but, of course, dealing with its consequences is only part of the picture, we must prevent them also. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why it is important for us to give the EMSA, which provides the Member States with important support, the necessary financial security for it to do its job. It is very important that its duties be extended, so that the EMSA can acquire every effective new means for combating all forms of deliberate and accidental pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of operational support to the Member States must be strengthened by providing specially equipped vessels to combat pollution and creating a central satellite photograph transmission centre for surveillance and prompt location.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Agency must also address other matters, such as the disposal of the oil recovered and air surveillance, activities for which additional funding will be required.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us not forget that the Agency's action complements that of the Member States. Consequently, action by the Member States also needs to be strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted he is in such wonderful and enviable health. I must say that he has done a fantastic job in cooperation with the Council with a view to reaching an agreement at first reading, since it was important to guarantee the stability and the work of this Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint proposals take up two of the requests presented by Mrs Miguélez Ramos and myself. One of them was that, while this new programme extended the Agency’s control to noxious substances, we should not overlook the fact that oil was at its basis. Secondly – and Mrs Miguélez Ramos has already mentioned this – with regard to the division by regions, the initial deficiencies on either side should be resolved, since the conditions for the contracts had not provided much motivation for the shipowners of the region, who did not have any interest in making ships available, and that was exacerbated by the lack of insistence on the part of the Agency. As Mrs Miguélez Ramos has quite rightly said, that has now been overcome and we are facing a much more practical and better-organised future.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we would say to the Agency and to the Commission that, in this multiannual programme, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control will also be watching very carefully to ensure that the actions, the action plan, and hence the presence of the vessels, are sufficient to meet any needs that might arise, and that we no longer have to face those deficiencies that we have seen in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end with an observation and a request to Vice-President Barrot, who I know is well-known for paying great attention to this Parliament’s appeals. At a time when the maritime borders of my country, of Italy, Malta and Greece are demonstrating their great weakness, we would like the Frontex Agency to have at least the same capacity for deployment of vessels and resources for controlling and protecting our maritime borders as we are approving today for the Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Vice-President Barrot to help his colleague Mr Frattini within the Commission to ensure that the Frontex Agency has the necessary resources as soon as possible, since this summer we have been in great need of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted at this because – as several of you have said – we must never forget the disasters of the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. That is why it is absolutely vital to use all means necessary, and now that Parliament and the Council have brought their texts into line with one another, we will be able to reach agreement at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission supports the compromise reached during the informal trialogue with the Council. In this spirit, it accepts the compromise amendments you have proposed, Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are supported by the various political groups and which reflect the compromise from the informal trialogue with the Council. I am quite sure that, tomorrow, the Members of the European Parliament will support this approach, even if the financial package of EUR 154 million must be regarded as a minimum, as stated in one of the recitals to the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the comments that have been made regarding the Agency’s missions. We can look at this extension as part of the revision of the regulation planned for 2007. I am thinking in particular, Mr President, of the current situation on the coast of Lebanon, where we should like to be able to respond more easily to the needs of our Lebanese friends. That said, I have also noted your desire to ensure that the efforts undertaken by the Agency in terms of combating pollution do not result in a disengagement from the Member States. We must be quite clear on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you, Mr President: the quality of this debate, and your various suggestions and proposals, show that Parliament really feels involved in these efforts to combat marine pollution and to protect the European marine environment, which is one of our great assets. I should therefore like to thank Parliament, and I hope that we will now be able to adopt this excellent text without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Strict and effective enforcement of international regulations by a large trading block like the European Union, the world’s foremost trading area, accounting for 24% of the global fleet, helps to enhance the credibility of the regulations even among ships flying third-country flags.
