<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thierry Cornillet (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, tourism is the largest global economic activity, both in terms of turnover and number of jobs. It is one of the most dynamic sectors in the world, true though it is that it is extremely volatile and very sensitive, particularly in the wake of attacks. Think of those of 11 September, which brought tourist development to a sudden halt. Developing countries were the first to suffer from this reversal.</p>
<p class="contents">The tourist economy characteristically cuts across an extremely wide range of areas. It naturally leads to the development of hotels, together with other forms of accommodation, such as self-catering cottages and family-run guest houses, that are outside the hotel system proper. It gives rise to restaurants, which may or may not be attached to hotels. It enables staff to be trained not only in the professions associated with the hotel and catering industry but also in languages. It makes for extremely wide-ranging economic activity, with all types of salespeople eager to respond to the demands of, for example, people who have forgotten their toothpaste or medicines or who want croissants to eat every morning in their hotel. Tourist development has bearing upon all areas of the food industry, not to mention, of course, all the souvenir shops there are.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, tourism in itself generates a very heavy demand for substantial forms of infrastructure, most prominent among which are not only airports but also sea ports and main roads, as well as smaller roads serving tourist destinations and other places to visit. Moreover, tourism encourages specific demand affecting areas over which the state traditionally has jurisdiction, be it in matters of security or public health. I shall return to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way in which it cuts across such a variety of areas, tourism therefore guarantees genuine economic development, but it does not stop there. Tourism also makes for land conservation and better protection of the environment, the fact of the matter being that, with the creation of world heritage sites, we now give serious thought to areas that are to be protected, without however being set piously apart, so enabling them to be exploited ‘intelligently’ for tourist purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism is also a factor in democracy and political stability because tourists with no intention of being bound by any all-inclusive<span class="italic"> </span>package see a country open up before them; because tourism is enriching and is educational in a way that, as everyone knows, undermines dictatorship; because tourism can establish ethical rules, particularly regarding child labour; and because the idea of fair tourism, which in fact constitutes a form of dissuasion, is beginning to make itself felt in our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, tourism is an essential factor in public health and education. Health risks constitute absolutely the wrong type of advertising. Remember the problem of Ebola virus in Congo and elsewhere. The same applies, however, to malaria and makes states much more sensitive to the need to eradicate these diseases. Tourism is extremely demanding in terms of decent hospital infrastructure which, of course, will also serve the local population. Finally, tourism is an educational factor because it makes people learn languages and in that way opens people’s minds.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not deceive ourselves. Tourism can also be a factor causing disturbance and leading to abuse. I shall give just two examples. The first is sex tourism, which is clearly a means of development for certain countries that do not provide themselves with the resources for preventing it. The second is property speculation, in particular that whereby leading families buy up properties or that whereby, if one is not careful, sites are destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that tourism is the world’s largest form of economic activity and that it can be an economic lever for developing countries cannot be a matter of indifference to the European Union. Tourism must therefore be better integrated into all forms of the aid we offer. That naturally applies to all our programmes, be they the EDF, MEDA, ASEAN or other programmes. The percentage of these funds directly appropriated to tourist development projects must be increased. We ourselves must strengthen our own structures. I am glad that Mr Michel is in the Chamber, because what I have just said applies not only to the Enterprise DG but also to the Development DG, both of which should have tourism departments with a bit more clout. We need help in strengthening the public-private partnership. Let us not delude ourselves. The public sector will not take care of tourist development in its entirety. Through the aid it supplies through ourselves and through the impetus it provides, in particular for the creation of major infrastructure, the public sector can, however, help tourism develop further.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, tourism must give rise to ethical reflection within the European Union and, more generally, at global level. To prevent corruption and merciless speculation in all its forms, help should not be given to just anyone, anywhere. Thought needs to be given to ways of putting a stop to sex tourism and, in particular, to the forms of legal action available to us in our own countries. Particularly when it comes to child labour, we need to be sure about the situation regarding working conditions and public freedoms within developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism, which encourages knowledge of other people and the exchange of experiences, offers a promising route for developing countries to go down. Finally, visitors to other countries are perhaps more aware than others of the urgent need there is to increase and channel international aid. The presence of that aid becomes apparent. Having seen evidence of it, people take an interest; and, having taken an interest, they give in a much more visible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome the in-depth work that has been done on the drawing up of this report and the resolution on tourism and development that is packed with interesting ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, has noted, the Development Directorate-General, which is under my authority, has no specialised service for tourism issues. That obviously does not mean, though, that there are no projects in this sector. Furthermore, in his explanatory statement, the rapporteur points to the significant funding from the European Development Fund in the sector. The Commission deals with the issue of tourism in the developing countries from the point of view of aid for the private sector and the sustainable management of natural resources. Tourist promoters in the developing countries therefore have all the instruments for aid to the private sector available to them. The investment facility managed by the European Investment Bank has thereby funded several hotel projects in the ACP countries, while the PROINVEST programme provides the sector with non-financial support, such as the strengthening of capacities and the promotion of investments.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Development fund has funded hotel training schools in numerous countries to accompany the rapid development of the tourism sector. Furthermore, road, port and airport investments funded by the European Development Fund play a crucial role in the development of tourism, as well as water supply, electrification, sanitation, waste treatment and environmental conservation programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the ecolabel system, promoted by the Commission, enables tourism entrepreneurs to obtain a label certifying that their tourism company respects environmental standards, which is important for the ecotourism market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very difficult to isolate purely tourist projects. The report acknowledges the transversal nature of the sector. I entirely agree with this idea. The European Union’s strategy consists of supporting the partners in their development efforts by helping them to enhance all the resources available to them, including tourism. In the case of the small island countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific, tourism is one of the only resources available. Furthermore, proper environmental management of ecosystems such as forests, coral reefs or rivers would allow these resources to be conserved and generate long-term revenue for the local population.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the points of view expressed in points 1 and 2 relating to durable or sustainable tourism. The European Union’s cooperation with its partners is aimed at promoting sustainable development based on local resources and which is respectful of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the increase in tourism projects advocated, I must point out that we must prevent the scattering of funding and, in order to achieve the maximum impact, the Commission, in agreement with the partner States, focuses its aid on a relatively limited number of sectors. These sectors are determined in joint agreement with the countries in question. Since tourism is essentially a private sector activity, the multiplication of tourist projects falls within the domain of promoters. For promoters in ACP countries, the Commission has established the Investment Facility, with a capital of EUR 2.2 billion, in order to respond to an increase in requests for funding. The Commission treats the participatory approach and the quest for adherence of the beneficiaries as one of the cardinal principles of its development policy. The private sector is consulted as recommended in point 15. As for the support for countries falling victim to natural disasters, this is already a constant of Community aid, as is the obligation to respect and protect the environment and local cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the concerns expressed in point 30 about the training of specialised personnel on the ground in the countries in question, and we would point out that this is precisely what the Commission has always favoured. In Madagascar, for example, the Commission has established a training project that is directed at both promoters and their employees. The Commission naturally agrees on the need vigorously to combat sex tourism, especially where the victims are children, in particular by providing the judicial systems of partner countries with all the assistance they need to eradicate this scourge.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Parliament for the attention it has given the Commission’s services and you may rest assured that I will take all the necessary steps to ensure a more effective monitoring of all activities relating to tourism. Nevertheless, the Commission does not believe that a Directorate-General should be created solely responsible for tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tourism, as the rapporteur rightly states in his report, is not only a factor of economic growth; it also makes a substantial contribution to democracy and political equilibrium in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, an effective EU policy of tourism to other countries depends on an integrated policy for sustainable European tourism within the European Union. I should like to link our debate today with the debate held on the guidelines for sustainable European tourism, because I believe that only if the European Union creates conditions of harmonious correlation between internal and external competence on tourism issues will it have an effective tourism policy for developing countries. In other words, <span class="italic">'in foro interno, in foro externo'</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Maastricht, tourism policy has been a central objective of the action of the European Union. With the European Constitution, tourism is reintegrated into the sectors of supporting, coordinating or complementary action by the Union. The legal basis therefore exists, as does the challenge to create a coordinated European policy of action in the tourism sector.</p>

<p class="contents">When looking at the developing world, we have to remember that tourism plays more of a role in some regions and countries than in others; the figures in the report show that. In the Caribbean, tourism is a key driver of the economy, but that is not the case across sub-Saharan Africa where, with a few exceptions, tourism is not such a big factor.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, the Socialist Group cannot support the report in its entirety. For example, we cannot support paragraph 8, which asks all developing countries to draft tourism development plans, to produce annual reports on figures and contributions, because that is not appropriate in all cases and in many countries it would be a pretty low priority. Nor can we agree with paragraph 10. At a time when the EU is demanding more and more visa controls from third country nationals, it seems a bit ironic that we then ask other countries to drop their visa requirements. Visas are often a major source of income for developing countries, so that is not something that we can support.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a couple of areas where the report could be more nuanced. For example, recitals Q and T. Experience shows that, unfortunately, it is quite possible for tourism to flourish alongside undemocratic regimes. Some of those regimes have proved good at protecting tourism and tourists with very strong-arm police tactics. However, they have at the same time been oppressing their own people, which is why I have reservations about paragraphs 24 and 25.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Socialist Group strongly support moves to develop tourism, particularly eco-tourism, sustainable tourism, and we welcome what the Commissioner said. We want the private sector to invest in tourism, but to do so responsibly, to develop tourism projects that contribute to the local economy and help micro-businesses to grow, so that local people benefit and local produce is consumed.</p>
<p class="contents">In too many areas including, for example, all-inclusive packages and cruise tours, tourism takes out of local economies, but often does not put much back in. In some cases – and here I disagree with Mr Cornillet – it can damage the environment, using scarce resources too much. We need to look more carefully at the kind of tourism projects we want to invest in. Could the EU and the Commission do more? I am sure they could, and we have heard some examples of what might be proposed. Do we need a new DG to do that? I am not so sure. I am not sure that if we had a DG Tourism it would in any case do much for the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the section on sex tourism. It is extremely important that we do a lot more to tackle this criminal activity, so thanks again to Mr Cornillet for his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the recitals are illuminating and critically enumerate a large number of problems, including child labour, the sexual exploitation of children and speculation in property. The Verts/ALE Group is glad to see this subject being discussed in this House at all and consideration being given to such aspects as the investment of profits from tourism in the developing country in question, the avoidance of mass tourism, the promotion of human rights and the maintenance of bio-diversity. We find it regrettable – and it is on this point that I largely agree with Mrs McAvan – that this document shows Europeans largely adopting an arrogant attitude towards third countries and regarding themselves as the measure of all things.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the report attaches far too little weight, in this area, to the protection of the environment and to the need for a truly sustainable economy. Discussion of the ecological and social consequences of mass tourism, such as water pollution, the alienation of the local population, or exploitation on the part of multinational hotel chains is absent or too diffuse.</p>
<p class="contents">As a first attempt, this report is important, but there are many things that it considers only half-heartedly or too vaguely. We hope that the Commission will go into the matters it has highlighted in greater depth, and that greater emphasis will be placed on international solidarity as a means of promoting peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, deserves our thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">For many of the poorest countries in the world, tourism does of course represent an important potential source of income, and that is why it is to the credit of both the rapporteur and the Committee on Development that, in considering the use of tourism in association with projects to combat poverty, they do not lose sight of the millennium development goals. That is something I regard as very important.</p>
<p class="contents">What prompts my fundamental criticism, though, is the way in which the report gives the impression that the EU is, as an outsider, announcing to the developing countries what they may and may not do. That I regard as improper. I do not think it right that the EU should interfere in the way the developing countries manage their visa policies. I do not think it legitimate that developing countries should be called on to submit reports to whomsoever, irrespective of what is then done with those reports. Nor, in my view, is a report of this kind the right place for the EU to demand the creation of special police units.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no mistaking the EU’s assumption, expressed yet again in this report, that tourism will help to resolve all the world’s remaining problems. It is because that is something I regard as highly dubious that I welcome the tabling of the amendment calling for the deletion of recital Q, according to which tourism is the enemy of totalitarianism, dictators and over-centralised power. That is wishful thinking that bears no relation to reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Kusstatscher, though, I do find it regrettable that this report scarcely mentions the real ecological problems associated with mass tourism, at any rate not to such an extent as would make it possible to resolve them. The amendments adopted in the Development Committee mean that the report does now contain wordings advocating that, but they go against the fundamental tendency of the report as a whole. My Group will not therefore be able to endorse this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report proposes, among other things, that an independent Directorate General for Tourism should be set up within the Commission. That means more power for the EU, something to which the June List is opposed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that a well-organised tourist sector has a lot of potential for helping improve the situation of people in many developing countries. The EU should not, however, conduct a common policy on tourism, as proposed in the report. We believe that the EU should only work on genuinely cross-border issues where it can add something of unique value not offered by already existing international organisations. This means that the EU should not devote itself to development policy and policy on tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 10 calls on developing countries to introduce non-restrictive visa policies. That is a completely absurd proposal. Developing countries must of course decide for themselves what visa policies they wish to operate. Otherwise, developing countries should demand that the EU too introduce a non-restrictive visa policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 24 advocates that criminal activity in developing countries be combated in such a way as not to damage those countries’ image as tourist destinations. Should the EU dictate to other countries how criminal activity should be combated?</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 25 calls for tourism to be promoted, protected and secured through initiatives to tackle crime directed against tourism, with such initiatives to include the setting up of specially trained police units. Again, this is not a task for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We are critical of the fact that paragraph 30 refers to the EU Constitution, which has already been rejected by the French and the Dutch. We advocate an EU with limited influence and shall accordingly vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is, however, one important point missing from this report in my view, namely a clear position on tourism to countries where human rights are grossly violated and where it would be useful if the European Union were to consider introducing an embargo in order to exert more pressure on the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">An example of this was given a few months ago by Mr Deva, who remarked that, in the Seychelles, the paradise islands, tourists pay 300 dollars a night and more for a hotel room, while the local people have to slave for the local potentate and his court of cronies for a few dollars a day.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist dictatorship of Cuba also springs to mind; this report makes cautious reference to it, but it is a place where opponents disappear behind bars for months and years without any form of trial, while the regime of an old and senile man guilty of crimes against humanity feeds on the currency of debauched western Europeans.

Clearly, aid in this area should be one of the priorities of the support provided by the European Union. At the same time, however, we need to be aware of certain threats to which tourists are exposed and of threats related to the flow of tourists affecting the 25 Member States of the Union. Issues concerning the way in which the tourist sector might support totalitarian regimes must feature prominently in any debate on tourism and development.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with concern that there is no reference to the drugs trade in the text. Nonetheless, it is the case that pleasure-seeking travellers to developing countries frequently resort to drugs. This leads to a boom in trade in all types of drugs on the territory of the country concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important not to overlook the threats posed to tourists by terrorists, whose activities are often directed against the former. Events in Egypt, where Islamic terrorists tend to target tourists, are a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">Potential epidemics represent another negative influence on the development of tourism, because travellers are deterred from visiting the country in question. We should therefore assure financial support to children’s immunisation programmes providing antigens to diphtheria, tetanus and other infectious diseases. A new disease representing a direct threat to European countries has recently emerged. I refer to avian influenza, which is also acting as a strong deterrent against travel to areas affected by this disease. Failure to react to this threat will be to nobody’s advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Sex tourism must not be overlooked either. It claims numerous child victims, and a determined and unequivocal attack on this practice and all the types of criminality associated with it is needed. I therefore propose providing logistical support to countries facing problems of this kind. Victims of sex tourism need to be rehabilitated, but it is important not to deal only with the consequences, but also to ensure tourists are fully aware of the treatment that will be meted out to them if they commit offences of this kind. Offenders must be dealt with with the utmost severity.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism serves as a source of income to totalitarian regimes. This is an important issue, but it is rarely mentioned. For the governments of several Member States of the European Union, the issue of maintaining diplomatic relations with the Cuban regime is a sensitive one, because it is so often linked to the tourist sector. On the one hand we realise how much such a poor country can be helped by supporting the tourist sector, but on the other we are aware that all the proceeds end up in the hands of a small exclusive group closely linked to Fidel Castro’s regime. I regret the lack of a clear and convincing approach to such situations in the document under discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important that we acknowledge that tourism is a major industry in many developing countries. Many developing countries such as poorer countries, and LDCs such as Mozambique and others, see it as a sector which needs to be developed further. Therefore, it is appropriate to ask the Commission to look at ways that we can do that, certainly with ACP countries, under the provisions already existing in the Cotonu agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">For some developing countries, tourism accounts for something like 50% of GDP, so we should be aware of that. We can be positive; it leads to the development of infrastructure, it can help to reduce the isolation of rural communities and it offers new opportunities for vegetable growers and others in developing countries. However, there are downsides, which all of us here would acknowledge. We need to have a proper regulatory framework that ensures that there are no corrupt practices and that there is no property speculation or environmental damage, and it should not be beyond the wit of us as donors to ensure that host countries do not suffer in any way from the development of tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">What I see and hear from the Commission is that there does not seem to be very much understanding of how we can actually integrate tourism into the broader development strategies we have; that ought to be positive and something that can be thought about. There need to be well publicised penalties, as my colleague has said, for people who are involved in sex tourism because so many people, especially children, are drawn into prostitution and drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a role to play here, and we have a role in pressing the industry – nobody here has spoken about the responsibility of the tourist industries in our own countries to ensure that their practices do not damage the countries where they are. We need to be sure that we are pressing the need for workers' rights – on low wages, on long hours and on the lack of secure contracts. This is the kind of thing that could be monitored through our ACP relationship with 78 countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I quite agree with the rapporteur that tourism can be a powerful force for good in countries in the developing world. However, I remember well, when I was working in India for six months, how very often the impact of tourism on local communities was negative. I suggest that one of the most useful things that we and the Commission can do to take this forward is to focus on sustainability and perhaps even the production of a code of best practice that companies can aspire to. We can be positive in this field. I look forward to seeing how the Commission will take it forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tourism today is an undisputed promoter of development, and it is also a key part of our development policy. It boosts employment, standards of living, health, and the infrastructure of many developing countries. I wish to raise three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we need cross-border cooperation between the EU and the developing countries, between the countries of Africa and the developing countries, and cooperation too within the countries themselves. This requires cooperation between the public and the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that, in my opinion, we need rules based on sustainable development. We have to pay attention, as many have already done in their speeches earlier on, to the matter of combating and weeding out child sex tourism. I think we would do well to earmark financial assistance for this. It is very much a matter of enlightening people’s attitudes both in the West and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point is that we should invest in loans of cerebral capital, by which I mean people are sent from Europe to the developing countries to help promote economic growth, although in such a way that always takes account of the country’s own standpoint, the country’s special features, and the country’s culture. I spoke for two minutes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In economic terms, tourism is of crucial importance for a variety of industries. It lends impetus to the construction of infrastructure such as hotels, restaurants, airports and roads, as well as acting as a driving force behind improvements to educational systems, the growth of the construction and banking sectors and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. There can therefore be no question that the economic significance of tourism should be viewed in a positive light.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the political significance of tourism, a number of Members have already drawn attention to the fact that tourism can in many instances promote respect for human rights, civil liberties and democracy, as well as increasing political stability. I would furthermore point out that, at best, tourism can also encourage the mutual recognition of cultures, which is of enormous importance in this era of globalisation and diverse global risks.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, it is quite clear that tourism also poses certain risks. As far as the economy is concerned, these risks relate to over-dependence on tourism, which is a problem that previous speakers have already mentioned. Reference has also been made to environmental risks, for example the threat posed to sources of drinking and industrial water, which in many countries have been exhausted. A further unresolved problem relates to the treatment of waste, by which I mean both solid and liquid waste. It goes without saying that tourism also poses risks to society, for example the eradication of local cultures, prostitution and child prostitution, as mentioned by previous speakers, and, in a number of countries, the rise of various forms of intolerance, such as religious intolerance, various forms of xenophobia, racism and frequently also extremism.</p>
<p class="contents">I for my part am delighted that this report has been tabled, since it emphasises the opportunities offered by tourism, at the same time as highlighting the many risks it poses. Despite my reservations, I will vote in favour of it, although I too do not believe that a directorate-general should be set up for tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, tourism and terrorism do not mix and as an area meant to be emerging for good from the dark shadow of terrorism, we in Northern Ireland are beginning, I am glad to say, to see a steady gain from increased tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I greatly welcome that, but one has to recognise that, without real governmental commitment, the full potential can never be achieved. Tourism must plan well. It must build on opportunities. The Olympic Games coming to London in 2012 is such an opportunity for my region. I call not just for the Games but for the tourism spin-off to be managed and organised in such a way that every region of the UK will benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">2012 also presents particular opportunities for Belfast as it is the centenary of the Titanic – I might add that we had a ‘titanic’ victory last night on the football field over England! A world-class Titanic exhibition centre is planned for the very site where that famous ship was built. I trust neither national government nor Commission will be found wanting in financially contributing to the great success that venture can be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being from the Tyrol myself, I know what I am talking about, for the Tyrol is now one of the world regions most visited by tourists. Tourism is the fastest-growing area of the economy and is already providing millions of people with jobs. Although it has the potential to stabilise incomes and economic conditions in developing countries, it is important that we create the legal framework that is needed if they are to be rid of the perils and risks that follow in tourism’s wake.</p>
<p class="contents">What is most important is that we should put the development of tourism in each tourist destination on foundations that will be secure in the long term. As is stated in paragraph 35 of the motion for a resolution, which makes reference to the WTO’s code of ethics, we have to protect our hosts, and that means that tourists must treat their hosts as such, with respect, rather than behaving in such a way as to wreck structures that have evolved over time. Such aberrations as sex tourism deserve the most forthright condemnation, and, above all else, punishment at the hands of the law. We should maintain the European programmes that support financially the fight against these pernicious activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to protect nature in the places abroad that tourists visit, and not just by preventing the speculation in property to which paragraph 40 of the report refers. It is by our own habits of life that we destroy the natural resources of these countries. Let us bear in mind that we use far more water and energy than they do, and our lifestyles are of course exported by the way we act when we are there. There is also a dramatic increase in the amount of waste, which can result in the destruction of natural areas and to over-exploitation. This is where we have to start from the very outset with concepts of what sustainable tourism is and build on them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only if these conditions are in place that the beneficial effects of foreign travel can be felt to the full, by creating jobs and bringing prosperity, fostering economic development and, above all, stimulating population growth and the life of society. It can promote understanding between peoples, something that we need in a world that is, alas, becoming less and less secure. In any case, the report gets a warm welcome from me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have some doubts, however, about the Cornillet report, in which a number of redundant and naïve statements stand out. In recital S, for instance, the emphasis given by ‘and its defenders’ seems, quite frankly, worth changing; and in recital AG there are some rather meaningless points: it proposes that sex tourism should be combated by the authorities, in coordination with NGOs, and also the proposal of promoting tourism initiatives controlled by the Union seems impracticable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, for the sake of propriety, in paragraph 30 one cannot ‘welcome’ the new legal basis concerning tourism established in the European Constitution, since the Constitution is now worthless, dead and buried by the outcome of the referenda and also, for example, by the Blair Government’s fear of holding any more polls in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, development and tourism do not require increased spending. I am against strengthening the existing services or creating new ones in the directorates-general of the European Commission, as proposed by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will say first of all that, in general terms, I agree with the fundamental elements of the report, except perhaps for certain points raised during the debates, which I can agree with.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism may be a significant driving force for the development of a poor country. Having said that, however, we must also consider the social effects, the environmental effects and, I would even say, the effects on cultural heritage. In fact, even here in Europe, large numbers of visitors to certain places lead to wear and tear and measures have to be taken to deal with it. I therefore believe that we must always bear in mind the need to protect countries’ cultural heritage. To the effects that I have already mentioned, I would also add the speculative effects and the economic effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I believe that we must respect a fundamental principle, and that is that it falls first and foremost to the partner States to decide whether to treat tourism as a priority economic sector. It is not our job to decide for them. On this basis, what seems to me to be important at Commission level – and I shall offer a very firm commitment in this regard, Mrs Kinnock – is that, as well as contributing to the creation of tourist infrastructures by means of development projects, it could provide governments with useful know-how in terms of assessing the positive and negative effects of investments in the tourism sector and the use of the various instruments available in order to prevent the least desirable consequences. I believe that there is a lot of study to be done in this regard but I agree with you, Mrs Kinnock, that, for our part, we have not given this issue sufficient consideration. I therefore promise that we will work on this issue because I believe that we can provide the countries in question with the necessary know-how to ensure that investments in tourism conform to a whole series of criteria relating to best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to digress slightly. I am currently working on an idea which would be a kind of ethical label intended for private companies that receive and manage the funds that the Commission grants them within the framework of cooperation. I shall soon have the opportunity to hold an exchange of views and to consult Parliament on this issue. We will be able to create a link between that label and the reflection that I was talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall say a word about sex tourism. It is proposed to restore the budget line dedicated to the fight against sex tourism in order to guarantee the effective allocation of resources for that action. The reform of budget lines proposed by the Commission within the framework of the financial perspectives 2007-2013 is aimed at establishing a more efficient and rational framework for the creation and management of these lines, to put an end to the pointless fragmentation and to improve the establishment of priorities within the lines. The European Parliament and civil society will be fully consulted with regard to the implementation of this reform. That is a promise. Such an important issue as combating sex tourism will certainly find its rightful place within the context of 'Human and social development', together with other issues such as the fight against AIDS, gender equality, training problems or social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, you may rest assured that we shall apply every possible attention and determination to trying to put in place an arsenal of support instruments aimed at developing countries that want to invest in tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
