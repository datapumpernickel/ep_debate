This especially applies to those European nations that have only recently fought for and gained their freedom of speech after having been freed from communist dictatorship. It was this right that Hungarian revolutionaries sacrificed their blood and their lives for in 1956, and a very valid and extraordinary historical and emotional political cause is needed to infringe this sacred right. A worthy cause, not unlike many of the recent proposals advocating a ban on the use of the much-hated Nazi symbol, the swastika, in homage to the victims of Nazi atrocities and guided by responsibility towards future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the history of the reunited Europe includes another evil totalitarian dictatorship, red Communism, which, during its short 20th-century reign, was also responsible for the systematic murder of millions of innocent people. Therefore, if the Union wishes to propose a ban on the swastika, I suggest adding the symbols of the hated and bloody communist dictatorship as well. Such a ban has existed in Hungary for over ten years. No more Nazism in Europe, no more communism in Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we dispense with historical truth, we may well heighten the threat posed to some by the new ideology of death and contempt for the individual. Allow me to remind Europe and the world that the Second World War was started by the Germans, who were possessed by hideous convictions on racism and death. Six million Poles died in that war. On the territories occupied by them, and notably in Poland, the Nazis created numerous death camps where torture and forced labour also took place. Auschwitz was the largest of these camps, and it was conceived in order to eliminate the flower of the Polish nation. Some four million people of different nationalities, including Jews, Poles, Roma, Russians and others, died in that place of unspeakable suffering. Every one of the lives lost there is of equal value. It would be unworthy of us to play dirty games on the graves of millions of our innocent brothers and sisters. We must not demean ourselves by seeking advantage from their deaths. Above all, we are duty bound to remember, honour and pray for the victims murdered by the Nazis. Let humble reflection on the tragedy of Auschwitz cleanse the guilty and be a warning to today’s world. We must learn from the truth about Auschwitz. As long as we continue to allow the innocent to be slaughtered in today’s society, we will have failed to grasp that truth. I am referring also to the slaughter of unborn children. Every individual’s life is sacred. We need to learn from the example of love and reconciliation shown by the holy martyrs of Auschwitz; Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish monk, and Edith Stein, a Jewish nun. Saint Maximilian, Saint Edith, Sister Benedicta of the Cross, pray for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a new phenomenon, and it does not only concern Germany. It is actually a problem for the whole of Europe, because third-country citizens with links to organised crime can obtain travel documents illegally. They then pose a threat to the security of the whole European Union, as they can of course move freely over the territory of the whole of the Community. To date, attention has focused mainly on the new Member States, which have been criticised for corruption amongst those responsible for internal security and for a lack of transparent procedures. Special clauses on protection are in force, and the new Member States are being monitored to ensure they meet their commitments in connection with assessing their readiness to become part of the Schengen area. The controls applied to the old Member States regarding their implementation of these commitments are not at all as strict. Would this not be an appropriate opportunity to dispel the myth that corruption and irregularities of this kind are particularly rife in the new Member States? In my view, the Commission and the Council should devise an assessment process applicable to all Member States equally. Such a process would also cover procedures and practices for issuing visas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clear evidence has emerged that the police, the British army and intelligence services all colluded in his murder. Former Canadian Supreme Court judge Peter Cory recommended a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Finucane’s murder and identified the basic requirements for a public enquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these was that the tribunal should have full power to subpoena witnesses and documents, together with all the powers usually exercised by a commissioner in a public enquiry. However, the British Government has recently published a draft inquiries bill. This bill is a wholesale departure from both Irish and British Government agreements and the Cory recommendations. It gives a British Government minister the power to determine whether an inquiry sits in private and what material is withheld. These provisions attack the very independence essential to any inquiry. The British Government is continuing to hide the truth of Mr Finucane’s murder for its own political reasons. The European Parliament must make clear to the British Government that in order to comply with Article 2, any tribunal must as a minimum have the characteristics identified by Judge Cory.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I raise this matter and put the British Government on notice that it cannot hide the truth from the Finucane family or the European Parliament for much longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How did this come about?</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this week, Mr Michael Howard, Leader of the Conservative Party, announced policies supposed to halt the flow of uncontrolled asylum seekers into Britain. However, EU officials quickly informed him and the British public that this is an area of policy, like so many others, that is now under the control of the European Union and not the British Government.

These statements were detrimental to the image of the European Parliament, and were made in January, when Mr Buttiglione gave an address at the University of Lublin during an official visit to Poland. The address was subsequently printed in <span class="italic">Rzeczpospolita</span>, the leading Polish daily, under the striking title of ‘The humiliation of a Christian’. Mr Buttiglione complained that the European Parliament did not endorse his candidature for Commissioner because of his views on homosexuality. He failed to mention his opinions on the role of women, single mothers or asylum policy. He levelled accusations at us, alleging that a powerful Brussels lobby wishes to impose on all Member States the recognition of same-sex marriages and the active promotion of a homosexual lifestyle by all countries. I shall spare you his other accusations and come to my conclusion, which is the following. Mr Buttiglione states that it is essential to reform the European Parliament so as to avoid future injustices of the kind perpetrated against him. There is a threatening ring to such a statement on limiting the rights granted to Parliament by the Treaties, made by someone who is a Minister for European Affairs and failed candidate for Commissioner. I leave you to make your own ethical and political assessment of the statement, ladies and gentlemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim was to do so by brute force, and they were to be brutal and show no mercy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nazis sent people to Auschwitz simply because they were Jews, Poles, Roma or Russians. The innocent were slaughtered on the streets in the name of a hideous ideology. Whole nations were exterminated, and sadly the atrocities continued after the end of fascism. People are still being killed every day. There are many doctors engaged in ending the lives of thousands of patients, including newborn infants. The killing of unborn children is widespread, and some 50 million of them die every year. Millions more children are starving to death, and many are the victims of sexual exploitation. In the course of adapting itself to the EU, Poland was transformed into a market economy. The economy was ruined, which led to unemployment, poverty and the collapse of health care. This will result in the gradual extermination of the Polish nation. At the same time, history is being falsified in a slanderous manner, and it is being implied that the Polish people took part in the Holocaust. Poland survived two totalitarian regimes, and this is why it has taken it upon itself to sound a warning against what the Holy Father has termed the civilisation of death. Beware of the cult of money, and of perceiving the market as the only purpose of life, as this is bound to result in the annihilation of Western civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to take this opportunity to make a strong protest and appeal to all upright Members of the European Parliament and of national governments in Europe who claim to long for a great and strong European Union based on the principles of honesty, social justice and solidarity. Moves towards a 20% cut in the current European budget will inevitably mean that future development of the Union will be at the expense of its smaller and less-developed members. The latter actually need considerable investment, particularly for infrastructure, so as to have equal opportunities for development. I therefore believe that a policy of this nature runs counter to all the ideals that are supposed to underpin the European Union. It creates social inequality and injustice and transfers costs to the poorest countries. This is unfair, and I call for a review as a mater of urgency. After all, we cannot have more Europe for less money, and richer countries cannot change policies following the admission of poorer ones, when they had previously promised them substantial resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The authorities are quite indifferent to this. Infanticide takes place at the Academic Hospital in Groningen, and hospital representatives have admitted that euthanasia was practised there on four children in 2003. According to the Dutch Ministry of Justice, some 30 children have been killed in this way since 1997. The Dutch authorities have failed to react. Practising euthanasia on sick newborn babies amounts to murder and is on a par with the actions of the Nazis, who eliminated the sick from society. It is an infringement of the most fundamental human right, the right to life. Killing sick children by administering a lethal dose of sedatives is an act of unspeakable barbarism. Europe has gone as far as protecting even the rights of animals, yet at the same time defenceless newborn children are being killed. I move that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should take up the matter, and that Parliament should hold a debate on practising euthanasia on children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s crocodile tears really are ridiculous. The cost has indeed exceeded EUR one billion this year, but it must be recognised that this is also a matter of demonstrating an appreciation of the value of linguistic and national diversity. It is precisely that diversity, together with the respect for national identity which is largely expressed through the use of the language, that ensure acceptance of the concept of the European Communities by the citizens of the Member States. I would suggest that those seeking to save by reducing translation should consider cutting costs elsewhere. The best way to do so would be by reducing their own salaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had a very important oral amendment to the resolution on Auschwitz. Therefore, I wish to put on record now what I was trying to propose.</p>
<p class="contents">On the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz, it is very important that we remember and honour the Jewish victims and the other national victims, like the Poles, Russians etc., who died in Auschwitz. However, one group has been completely forgotten – the group that Hitler first attacked and continued to attack to the very end, in every concentration camp and in universities and hospitals throughout the Reich: the disabled. In fact – not in Auschwitz but in other concentration camps – the ovens were made originally to eliminate disabled people. Disabled people of all nationalities were exterminated for the simple reason that they were disabled. Of all the groups, none are currently in threat of their lives simply because they belong to that grouping – except the disabled. The disabled remain forgotten. In most countries with abortion, and in those countries with euthanasia, people can now be exterminated simply because they are disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to place on record that on this day we reverently honour the Jewish victims of Auschwitz and the other victims, but it should be put in very bold letters that the disabled were there from beginning to end and were killed for no other reason than that they were not perfect, which is what Hitler’s Reich was looking for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
