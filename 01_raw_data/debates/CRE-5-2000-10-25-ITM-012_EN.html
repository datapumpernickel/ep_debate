<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, we now have a considerable amount of knowledge of endocrine disrupters. There have been many suspicions, but many causal relationships have been clarified concerning how endocrine disrupters affect animals and humans. We know that they can result in lower reproductive capacity. We know that they can cause deformities in the sexual organs, in both animals and humans, and we know that they can cause severe diseases, including testicular cancer and breast cancer. However, at the same time, there is still great uncertainty concerning the collective consequences of the many endocrine-disrupting substances. In reality, then, it is impossible to form an overview of the situation, including the situation where future generations are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this is a really frightening prospect. Until now, the attitude has been that there must firstly be an acknowledgement of the risks posed by substances and that action is not taken until the damage has been done. Naturally, this situation is untenable. That is why it is a good thing that the Commission has led the way with a communication concerning an EU strategy for endocrine disrupters. However, I think that the Commission's strategy is a little too hesitant. It could easily be slightly more ambitious. I think that what are needed are some more aggressive and effective initiatives in the short term. And it is this that I am trying to rectify in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, it is important that the list of substances that are, or are suspected of being, endocrine disrupters be drawn up and that this be done very quickly. In the report I have proposed that this should be done before the end of this year. It is also important that we have the necessary resources for the list to encompass all the relevant substances, expected to number approximately 560. At the same time, it is essential for the most dangerous substances on the list to be identified so that initiatives can be taken immediately to intervene in respect of the most dangerous substances. Various measures may be taken: bans, phasing out over a shorter or longer period of years and other restrictions on use. It ought to be possible to draw up this list of dangerous substances by mid-2001. In this connection, I believe that it is important to conclude that it must be done without waiting for further testing. We must also do it through aggressive use of the precautionary principle, in which connection I also think it is important to give consideration to particularly vulnerable groups. I am thinking of pregnant women, infants and certain groups of workers who run a particularly high risk of being affected by these substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that a major effort should be made to establish effective monitoring in the Member States and under the auspices of the EU. Industry must be required to report on which chemical substances are being put onto the market, in what quantities they are being used and what the expected effects are. We all also know that more resources must be put into research into both the extent of the problem and the consequences of it, as well as research into test methods and special research on mixture effects and synergetic effects. We know that these substances can interact in a particularly unfortunate way. In this connection I also believe that special research into the risks is important and, moreover, that we should ensure that the research is independent, i.e. that we do not base our political initiatives on the producers’ own research.</p>
<p class="contents">Where research is concerned, we also know that international cooperation is important, including cooperation with the United States and Japan. As part of future legislation on chemical substances, I believe it would be a good thing if we succeeded in establishing a special framework, some special chapters on endocrine disrupters. There must be a legislative framework that is based on the precautionary principle and on the principle of a reverse burden of proof. At the same time, a timetable should be set for the testing of existing substances. In suggesting a legislative framework, I am also saying that I believe the rules should be binding. All experience of voluntary agreements in this area is poor.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the various groups and thank the Commission for the cooperation we have had in connection with the drawing up of the report. Regarding the amendments, I will simply point out that my own is a linguistic improvement to Paragraph 15 of the report and that I cannot recommend that we vote for Mrs Grossetête’s three amendments. I believe that the proposals are largely inspired by the chemical industry, members of which have made the effort to contact me. The intention is clear: they wish to try to put obstacles in the way of action being taken here and now, and I believe it is important to emphasise that the advice we are getting from the scientific ethics committee is, in fact, advice and that it will not become actual legislation. It is ourselves in the Commission, the Council and Parliament who must lay down the legislative frameworks, and not the scientific committees. They serve as advisers in the same way as we receive advice from the other side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the rapporteur that it is frightening, particularly the effects on generations to come and the effects on unborn children. In recent decades, growing evidence has accumulated on the hormone-like effects of a number of industrial chemicals that have appeared in the environment. These substances have been termed endocrine disrupters. Endocrine disruption is not in itself an adverse outcome but a mechanism, which may have carcinogenic, reproductive, developmental or behavioural effects. Some of these effects can be detected using current testing procedures even though it may not be clear whether the disorder has been brought about through endocrine disruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Eco-Toxity and the Environment has noted that there is a potentially global problem with wildlife. Equally, the Scientific Committee's opinion on human and wildlife health effects – with emphasis on wildlife – said that the health effects on human beings must be investigated because the associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals and human health disturbances need to be verified. In general, scientists are suspicious of organochlorine compounds such as PCBs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has therefore reached certain conclusions, in particular that all 560-plus suspected endocrine disrupting substances need to be fully evaluated. We need to look at these in the Sixth Framework Programme. We need to focus on both women and men. We refer to the technical term "oestrogen" as well as "androgen" so it is not just a male problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These substances can have excessively harmful effects on reproductive functions, whether they be human, animal or plant. We do not know the maximum exposure levels or the likely exposure times involved. These substances themselves have not been listed. That is already a lot of questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing on research now will provide us with the means to find answers to all these questions. Moreover, this is the meaning of paragraphs 3, 6 and 7. Better cooperation with American and Japanese research authorities is absolutely vital. A programme of Community research that enables as much information and scientific proof as possible to be gathered must be supported. In our 2001 budget, we must set aside appropriations on a par with our ambitions for the sixth framework programme on research and development. This research alone will allow us to take into consideration the specific risks linked to these disrupters in future framework legislation on chemical substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur – who has produced an excellent report – cites the precautionary principle as the basis for the relevant measures to be taken. But also in this respect, intellectual honesty must be demonstrated. The precautionary principle not only leads to the implementation of legislative measures; positive, non-legislative measures may also be introduced. My amendment aims to make this reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and the Environment, which was expressed on 5 September, will be taken into consideration. The expertise of this scientific committee is well known and it would be appropriate to take its opinion into account before any legislative decision is taken. I think that it is important that we should rely on the opinions of experts. The precautionary principle also dictates that we should base our decision on the best scientific knowledge available.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Europe People’s Party and European Democrats is henceforth opposed to the motion to shift the burden of proof as of today. I feel bound to repeat this, although this is what I have been saying all along. So, even though there are no certainties, it is much too early to overturn the regulations on responsibility applied to this matter. In the case of dangerous substances, authorisation is required before they can be placed on the market. It seems to me that this procedure is already a safeguard.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that our Parliament must send a realistic and responsible message to the general public, to consumers, to the Commission and also to industry in general. Their doubts and concerns are real. We must provide a commensurate response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a particular problem with marine flat fish – flounders in the estuary of the River Mersey in fact – which are exhibiting extreme intersex characteristics and we do not know what the cause is. We have a lot of chemical factories around the estuary and suspicion has fallen on them, but the scientists are also looking at the detergents which are used both for industrial purposes and in our own homes. They are looking at oestrogens – synthetic oestrogens in particular – used perhaps in the pill by hundreds or thousands of women in the region. Indeed, they are looking at natural oestrogen produced by women in their millions. It could be a combination of all these things – and this is the difficulty. We do not know the answers and there are more than 500 chemicals from which we could choose.</p>
<p class="contents">I have doubts about the use of the precautionary principle and of course, about the misuse of the precautionary principle – by its nature we never know when it is appropriate to use it or not. There must be very great concern about the long-term effects of putting thousands of chemicals into the natural environment, but it is difficult to identify exactly which chemicals to target. The evidence of falling sperm counts, of rising levels of breast cancer, of female polar bears growing penises or whatever gives rise to very real fears and we have to be prepared to ban some substances on suspicion alone, even before we have firm scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I support both the Commission's proposals and the rapporteur's suggestions. However, we can be sure that there are many disputes to come when we start highlighting chemicals which must be banned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Endocrine disrupters are a relatively new concept. In my own linguistic area, the term did not become an established concept until one or two years ago. I know that the Danish equivalent is oestrogen substances and that they have been the topic of discussion for nearly ten years. The English term is endocrine disrupters and, certainly in scientific literature, they are the subject of a heated debate. But in German, for example, there is still no term which has become established. This indicates that the problem is new but no less serious as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully back the 2001 deadline. I fear that the European Commission, under pressure from the chemical industry, will want to wait too long before introducing statutory measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Half of the 560 substances which are suspected of having an endocrine disruptive effect are pesticides. The Commission has admitted this in response to my questions within the Environment Committee. We ought to start with these. They should, in any event, not be placed at the end of the list.</p>
<p class="contents">Do endocrine disruptive characteristics play a role in the approval of pesticides at the moment? Unfortunately not. They do not feature in the so-called uniform principles, although they should. In my view, this should be put right during the revision of the Pesticide Directive in 2003 at the latest. I hope the Commissioner is able to give us a response on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effects of artificially produced chemicals that are discharged into the environment are clear. There are many examples of damage to the reproductive capacity and development of animals and plants. One of the more unpleasant examples of this is sexual abnormalities observed in bears in the Antarctic. This example shows that the harmful effects of various endocrine disrupters is a global problem that has affected even the most isolated parts of the world. The research results presented by Professor Skakkebæk of Denmark concerning the marked reduction in male sperm quality should also give rise to deep concern. We are actually in a situation in which young men should have their sperm quality tested to see whether they should start a family before they had intended to, simply in order to be fairly certain of having children.</p>
<p class="contents">As Torben Lund so rightly stated, the precautionary principle should therefore be put at the top of the agenda. It is precisely now that there is reason for using this principle far more aggressively. With reference to the precautionary principle, we shall be able to introduce urgent measures with a view to avoiding possible irreversible damage to humans, animals and plants. It is appropriate now to put practice before fine words concerning the protection of health and the environment and to make use of the principle in an area about which we still know very little. It is the only answer to give to a concerned public. We cannot be too prompt in implementing the report’s recommendations to the effect that future framework legislation on chemical substances should be based both on the precautionary principle and on a reverse burden of proof. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that, despite the fact that my ordinary profession is within the area of internal medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">Far too little is known about the mechanisms of action of endocrine disrupters. Individual variation is very great. In addition, sensitivity varies from one period to the next during the human life cycle. Therefore, we cannot follow conventional routine and establish limit values for appropriate maximum exposure, since such limit values cannot be established in the case of endocrine disrupters. In our capacity as politicians, we must take the problem of endocrine disrupters with the utmost seriousness.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that the Commission’s strategy document in this area is very good. We need greater knowledge, research must be given priority, risk assessment must be accelerated and possible replacement substances must be identified. We need statements from the scientific committee. The public should be given objective information. We need consultation with Member States, with industry and with a variety of organisations. To achieve this, it is reasonable for the Commission to work on the basis of a priority list.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal on the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have an important objection, for I do not share the view that voluntary agreements in general are not a practicable way to proceed. On the contrary, I feel that voluntary agreements can be a faster way to proceed than going down the route of legislation. Agreements such as time limits on use, restrictions on release onto the market and the phasing in of various risk-free products are often preferable when the circumstances have not been clarified, but where it is valuable to be flexible and to take measures rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise that the legislative methods must always be preceded by a comprehensive scientific assessment and recommendation from the scientific committee. These assessments and recommendations must be observed by us as decision makers. It is a requirement of political propriety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE).</span></span>   – I think anyone listening to this debate who has never heard of endocrine disrupters would be forgiven for thinking that endocrine disrupters were more to do with some science fiction horror story than their own public health. Yet the reality is that this is a critical public health and animal health issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Presently, Community chemicals legislation fails to address the risk that endocrine disrupters pose. It is a worrying fact that the human body contains more than 100 chemicals which were not present 50 years ago. Numerous female health problems have been linked to exposure to endocrine-disrupting substances. There is also a possible link between such substances – as other colleagues this evening have mentioned – with increased incidences of breast cancers, other cancers and the lowering of sperm count. The impact this may have on the health and reproduction of both humans and wildlife is worrying, with children, pregnant workers and other vulnerable workers being some of the most sensitive groups.</p>
<p class="contents">A further problem is the fact that it is almost impossible to set limit values for hormone-mimicking substances. From the consumer's point of view it has been suggested that the balance of proof be changed to require manufacturers to prove at least a reasonable certainty of no harm before putting any product on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Wider availability of information is also recommended under the right-to-know principle. There is a need for more research to enable us to act quickly, effectively and with certainty. The need for a European strategy is critical. That is why this report is so important. More information, more public awareness and, most importantly, more research is what is needed.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – First I would like to express my appreciation for the Parliament response to the Commission communication on a Community strategy for endocrine disrupters and for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Lund.</p>
<p class="contents">There is hardly any conference on the topic of chemicals that does not touch on the subject of endocrine disrupters. One of the reasons for this is the significant potential damage that such substances can cause to animals and human beings and, most importantly, to the unborn foetus and our reproductive capacity. It is difficult to imagine a more unsustainable trend than one that would lead to deterioration in our capacity to reproduce.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of endocrine disrupters is a complex one where there are still many questions to be answered. There are certain things we know. For some we can make predictions with confidence and others where we are faced with considerable uncertainty. What we do know is that a number of man-made chemicals that have been released into the environment, as well as a few natural ones, have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, including humans. Among these are persistent bio-accumulative compounds that include some pesticides and industrial chemicals as well as other synthetic products. Many wildlife populations are already affected by these compounds.</p>
<p class="contents">There are adequate quantitative data showing a causal link between exposure to these substances and a reduction in reproductive success in wildlife. There are also some general conclusions that have been drawn by the research community such as the fact that the chemicals concerned have entirely different effects, as Mr Arvidsson said, on embryos, foetuses and perinatal organisms than on adults and that effects are more often manifested in offspring, rather than in a parent that has suffered exposure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are also many uncertainties since the nature and extent of the effects of exposure on humans are not well established. Information is limited, especially on concentrations of contamination in embryos. The need for further examination of the potential risks of such substances to fill the knowledge gaps so we can take appropriate action is the very reason why I presented the proposal for a Community strategy for endocrine disrupters. All of us have the right to know and the obligation to learn. Let me turn to the key elements of the strategy. The basis for it is the precautionary principle. I am pleased that Parliament supports the Commission objective to identify appropriate policy action on the basis of the precautionary principle in order to respond quickly and effectively to the problem of endocrine disruption.</p>
<p class="contents">This principle and the need to develop quick and effective risk management strategies in relation to endocrine disrupters was also stressed by the Environmental Council in its conclusions of 30 March. At the same time, Parliament perceives a lack of ambition in the Commission strategy concerning the need to reduce human exposure to endocrine disrupters and protect wildlife.</p>
<p class="contents">This I would like to address at the outset with a number of comments. There are two core components of the Commission strategy. One is further research and development and the other is the development of agreed test methods. Regarding research and development, the Commission's main instrument is the fifth framework programme on research and development. I am pleased to inform you that endocrine disruption has been highlighted as a priority research topic in the latest revision of the relevant programmes concerning human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also planning a dedicated call for proposals on endocrine disruption which will serve to further reinforce endocrine disruption research. The recommendations in the Parliament motion for a resolution will be taken into account. Regarding the development of agreed test methods, this will require a two-to-four year horizon. Agreement on test methods aims to ensure that everyone involved agrees that the tests designed to detect the right elements and the test results can be interpreted in a uniform way. Without such agreement we will constantly be faced, not just with scientific uncertainty but with opposing views on the science. For this reason we believe that legislative action to reduce exposure in a comprehensive manner, on the basis of the precautionary principle, can be considered only when agreed test methods are available.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreed test methods are also necessary to launch a comprehensive exercise in the search for substitutes. Otherwise, possible substitutes may be open to the same suspicion as the substances they replace. At the same time we need to take into account existing scientific evidence. That is why we make provision in the short term to act without agreed test methods on the basis of the precautionary principle and on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament supports the Commission objective to identify a first set of endocrine disrupting substances by the end of this year and to identify specific cases of consumer use and eco-system exposure for special action without awaiting further tests. An analysis of existing legal instruments relating to endocrine disrupters will also be part of this exercise. Let me make two comments on this.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Commission objective of the end of 2000 is based on a two-step process: firstly a candidate list compiled by consultants and secondly prioritisation. Commission adoption of a proposal for prioritisation will follow. So far, only the candidate list has been completed. The second step of this exercise involves consultation with stakeholders in which we aim to achieve as wide a consensus as possible on priority substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot give a commitment now that all 553 candidate substances will be on the priority list without pre-empting the outcome of the stakeholders' discussions, which are under way. The Scientific Committee as well as industry have been critical of the candidate list, the BKH report. In contrast, initial comments received from Member States and NGOs indicate support for the report as a valid starting point. The Scientific Committee's criticisms of the scientific shortcomings of the report will be addressed in the next stages of prioritisation and further evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add here that some of the criticisms are based on the false assumption that a group of 60 substances identified in this report will be the priority substances. These substances are in fact part of a candidate list of 553 substances on which discussions on priorities are still under way. It is also important to bear in mind that the list to be established must be a dynamic one. New substances can be added or indeed initial substances removed as new evidence comes to light.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment in relation to the priority list of substances concerns the request in the motion for a resolution for a decision on intervention on specific cases by mid-2001. In order to identify specific cases for special action from the priority list, a more in-depth evaluation will be required on consumer uses and eco-system exposure. In addition, the role of the scientific committees in providing independent scientific advice will be crucial in these specific cases. It is ambitious to expect to achieve these goals in six months. However, we will use our best endeavours to work as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you are aware, the Commission intends to present a White Paper on the overall chemicals policy by the end of this year. We are working on that right now and I have seen the first drafts. One of the fundamental principles for this policy is to ensure a high level of protection. Clearly the endocrine disrupting strategy must be consistent with the overall policy on chemicals. A number of specific elements in Parliament's motion for a resolution, such as the shifting of the burden of proof, a redefinition of the responsibility of manufacturers, a review of labelling legislation and grouping of chemicals for screening and testing, must be and are being addressed in the context of this overall chemicals policy. The views of Parliament expressed in the motion for a resolution will be taken into account in the White Paper under preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding international cooperation and information exchange, the Commission is organising a workshop on endocrine disrupters in the first half of 2001 with the sponsorship of the World Health Organisation among others. This workshop will convene all stakeholders to take stock of progress and make further recommendations on the development of test methods and testing strategy, research and the establishment of monitoring programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should again like to thank Parliament for its support in addressing this issue and I would like to underline the Commission's commitment to implementation of its strategy and to taking on board the elements of the Parliament motion for a resolution in a comprehensive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
