<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fraisse (GUE/NGL),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what strikes a new Member, such as myself, on joining the European Parliament, and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, is that there is no coherent vision with regard to culture in Europe. I prefer to use the expression ‘vision’ rather than cultural ‘policy’. Those who call it cultural policy are referring to the debate or dispute that we could have. When we say, however, that there is no coherent vision, this quite simply means, for example, that cinema is dealt with from the point of view of industry, that music may feature in the budgetary lines, but that it all ends there, and that it is not clear how language or languages used in the theatre can be taken into account. That is why, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to draft this own-initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">From my perspective, this own-initiative report was a means of reducing, in this vast European area of culture, the difference between industry and music which is so marked. If you are interested in languages, theatre and the performing arts, what one also discovers is that, fundamentally, these areas make up our heritage. The theatre and the performing arts make up the heritage of Europe, and it is as much our literary heritage as our political heritage, since there is no theatre which has not been shaped, both by the birth of democracy and by the life of the streets and the city. That is also why I believe that the issue of the theatre and performing arts is of great importance in the European area.</p>
<p class="contents">When I began meeting performing arts professionals, what I heard first of all was their demand for freedom. They were adamant that they would not lose their freedom, or agree to us keeping checks on them, or creating an official art policy which would not be, in any shape or form, on the scale that they were seeking. That was the first thing that they said. The second thing that they touched upon was all the difficulties, the vast number of difficulties, such as double taxation, social and fiscal, but also the vast number of difficulties that they face when travelling. Because artists travel, they are already within Europe, they do not contemplate the issue of whether to stay in their own country or whether they are becoming uprooted, they travel and they need us to help them do this. This is a kind of reality that exists and that we must support. Of course, I do not believe – and this is increasingly evident with each passing day – that we can apply market and competition rules to the area of culture.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen this elsewhere: within the cinema, State aid is now recognised, even promoted or mimicked in countries other than those where this already exists. Even for the audiovisual industry therefore, we are aware of the importance of the role of State support. I believe that, for the performing arts and theatre in particular, it is the same thing, we must have State aid and this aid begins with the responsibility that the States must assume to facilitate the movement of individuals and productions in Europe, as well as to encourage training.</p>
<p class="contents">In one respect, this is quite simply the conclusion that my report reaches. Member States must also make an effort to cooperate. Eventually, we might stop thinking in terms of a divide. I feel that, in our never-ending debate on culture, we still mean that either culture will be dealt with by the Community, or it will be a matter of subsidiarity, and therefore we must not touch it. I do not feel that this divide is of any use or that it helps in any way, and I believe, on the contrary, that if we go back to Article 151 which calls for cultural cooperation, this is exactly what we must use in order to think in terms of a Europe of culture and a Europe of the performing arts.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, there are barriers, such as double taxation, the lack of legislation, and a common technical vocabulary. There are, however, remedies as well, such as sub-titling, the White Paper which could help us to harmonise legislation – and I hope that the Commission will listen to us – databases, and the sharing of vocabulary. Perhaps we should also take the advice of experts, artists, who know of current developments within the industry, when it comes to making decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must think about the way in which culture will be preserved, dealt with properly in the Convention and the future Constitution. I think we must also think about the European Council resolution put forward in June, which proposed a plan for cooperation in the area of culture. I think that we will be able, with the European Commission and Parliament, to support the resolutions of the European Council as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Fraisse, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fraisse and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, for this own-initiative report which, in my view, has become a tool for our action in the area of culture. I would like to respond to a number of points expounded in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the need for support for the performing arts. Under the cooperation agreements, I refer to Action II of the Culture 2000 programme, we are currently supporting, and will do so for three years, six networks in the area of the theatre, three in that of dance, seven in that of music, a network in the area of the circus and two interdisciplinary networks, and this is for performing arts networks alone. In addition, in order to promote the creation of platforms, we mentioned these as part of our deliberations on the future of cultural action at the forum on cultural cooperation in Europe. Creating these platforms is also part of the current deliberations on the future of the Culture 2000 programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the lack of statistics. The Commission is aware of the need to increase the production of European cultural statistics and the Eurostat ‘Cultural Statistics’ group is already working on several themes: cultural jobs, financing culture, cultural events. The quantification of data as far as the world of culture is concerned is not an easy task. It takes a great deal of time. Furthermore, a Eurobarometer survey on the participation of EU citizens in cultural activities was carried out this year at the Commission’s request.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly then, the need for measures to encourage the mobility of artists. This is certainly one of our great concerns. Your report accurately highlights the importance of information on aid structures for mobility, fiscal and social laws and administrative formalities to encourage mobility. We share these concerns, as does the Council, which is also examining a draft resolution on the mobility of artists. In this respect, I also believe it is very positive that the Member States are themselves considering these issues of mobility, which are primarily their responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Since a common area free from all barriers to movement has been very well established, the Commission is now trying to encourage mobility of all types. We have also recently published a study that specifically looks at the barriers to mobility in the cultural sector, the conclusions of which are combined with those of Mrs Fraisse’s Report. This study has been very well received by cultural circles.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that, as part of the action plan on mobility presented by the Commission at the European Summit in Barcelona, a comprehensive Internet site on the mobility of Europeans is to be set up in 2003 and the development of a ‘culture’ portal will enable the Commission to provide an increasing amount of information regarding mobility in the cultural sector. To achieve this, we have asked for the cooperation of the States, so that artists can make use of an information repository for all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak briefly about fiscal issues. The problems of double taxation are relatively rare, as our study showed. In the current situation, Member States are best placed to resolve amongst themselves the division of tax law, taking into account each specific situation. The application of fiscal conventions agreed between the States should eliminate the risk of double taxation. Nevertheless, the Member States must apply the conventions with respect for Community law and avoid any discrimination. I can assure you that the Commission is showing no hesitation and will show no hesitation in taking the appropriate measures in the event of such discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, the Commission is already doing a great deal to encourage mobility in this sector. It has taken two types of measures; ensuring the application of Community legislation and encouraging mobility in our financial instruments. Your resolution and that of the Council will support our efforts. In our view, because of the work that has been done, it is not necessary to draft a White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the circulation of works of art and shows is concerned, this is often related to mobility, of course. In this respect, there are particular objectives, such as those that you mention, including the creation of a database which makes it possible to exchange information on works of art. Work has already been done in this area, as part of the 2000 programme. For example, Culture Base Net is a project launched by the Haus der Kulturwelt <span class="italic">[World Culture House]</span> in Berlin, in conjunction with key players from Sweden, the United Kingdom and Denmark, in order to set up a database on the Internet which introduces artists from all over the world, beginning with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You mention in particular the question of free movement of stage equipment. We are not aware that barriers exist to the freedom of movement of this equipment, but we attach great importance to eliminating, at national level, administrative or bureaucratic complications in this area. We must, therefore, be informed of any barriers. Furthermore, so that the free provision of services is safeguarded, we are ensuring that the States do not make unjustified or excessive demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect is training. Regarding your request for a nomenclature of job roles, I would like to say to you that we are already working on this matter. Eurostat is working in conjunction with the Member States, within a working group, on the types of profession section of international classification which covers cultural roles, with the aim of improving and clarifying this nomenclature.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the recognition of qualifications, professions relating to the performing arts are, in most cases, professions that are referred to as non-regulated. This means that the recognition of qualifications for professional purposes depends on criteria drawn up by the professions themselves. Nevertheless, it is possible to improve this recognition, as well as the recognition for academic purposes, in other words, to help students continue with their studies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore decided to create and promote instruments which make the content of studies undertaken in other countries transparent. I am thinking of additional studies and of academic credit systems. It also supports the reliability of mutual recognition by establishing networks between all European art schools.</p>
<p class="contents">As for financial support from Europe for artistic training, there is no specific programme, but our education programmes support such training and we are seeing some encouraging signs. One example of many is that the number of Erasmus students studying arts subjects has increased from 3 250 in 1998 to 4 700 in 2001, and each school that is recognised as a higher education establishment in its country can apply to take part in Erasmus activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, you stress the need for broader and greater cultural cooperation, and in this respect as well, Mrs Fraisse, we share your concern. There is, moreover, continuity in Parliament’s requests in this area, and I refer you the Ruffolo Report.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural cooperation is an element of enlargement. What better example can I give than to tell you that the number of key cultural players in the candidate countries taking part in the Culture 2000 programme has rocketed to 120 in just one year?</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased to note that we are making progress in the area of dialogue between cultures. Thus, the project to establish a Euro-Mediterranean foundation for cultural dialogue is underway and, in the area of education and youth, we are moving with increasing resolve towards this theme. I would like to thank you, Mrs Fraisse, the members of the Committee on Culture, for this report which will be very useful in current deliberations on the future of the Culture 2000 programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We congratulate Mrs Frays on her report and will broadly support its adoption. We have tabled two amendments which we hope the House will accept.</p>
<p class="contents">The report constitutes a useful analysis of measures to encourage theatre and the performing arts throughout the EU, particularly focusing on the need for mobility. Presaging the enlarged EU, the rapporteur's explanatory statement notes that the candidate countries could not support cultural programmes through the PHARE and TACIS programmes but that artistic cooperation has been enhanced through the THEOREM programme, by which they gained access to the Culture 2000 programme last year, as Commissioner Reding has just reminded us.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mrs Fraisse's speech she drew attention to the need for vision and coherence in cultural matters in the EU and particularly in the enlarged EU. I very much support that. It is timely, following the Commission's announcement of approval for the ten candidate countries to accede to the EU and this weekend's referendum in Ireland, which cleared a potential obstacle to the enlarged EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's character is going to change very dramatically, particularly with the accession of the Central and East European countries. Culture surely has a huge role to play in this respect. To what extent does the existing programme deal with the years of collective amnesia in Western Europe, perhaps not so much in Germany and Austria, where there were always historical and family links, but in other countries where the shadow of the iron curtain still exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind Mrs Fraisse's call for vision and coherence, have we really done enough to bring home to the public in the present EU what completing the European family is going to mean, in the theatre and performing arts as well as other cultural fields?

<p class="contents">We all want a revival of the arts, and the performing arts in particular, and we feel that enlargement really will allow us to enter a new era in Europe. I am sure that each and every one of us, like the Commissioner, is eager to contribute to this revival in our own way, by providing a number of political tools. I have to say that the report, which I made a point of sending to numerous theatrical agencies in Greece, has excited a great deal of interest and they are waiting to see how tomorrow's vote goes and who votes against it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that political intervention to bring about an area of performing arts is extremely important and I just have one or two comments to make. Commissioner, I know that you are not responsible, but the statistics are so late, they are causing confusion and muddying the waters. We need these statistics and your support is important here. It is also important for dramatic works to be translated. They cannot appear first in book form and then as translations. Dramatic works really do need to circulate among artists as translations if they are to travel. And finally, the whole situation is in a state of flux. We have a Canadian initiative on international cultural collaboration, we have the ongoing discussion within the World Trade Organisation, and we shall have to wait and see how these situations develop.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have to harness our vision to political ideas which will bring about a cultural policy which revives rather than renationalises the performing arts, a policy that offers specific ways of making our dreams come true for European culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to thank Mrs Fraisse for her initiative to map out the state of affairs with regard to performing arts in the EU and the candidate countries. Given the wide area and the many variations in the different countries, it is a valiant and successful effort. Nevertheless, I should like to make a few observations.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, theatre exists by the grace of its producers, directors and actors, and I should like to add the theatre-going public to this list, for without an audience, there is no theatre. Many theatres and theatre forms have followers who unite in one way or another in ‘friends of …’, and I believe that they too deserve a mention when the topic of supporting the dramatic arts is mooted. They offer incentives, information and bring theatre to the attention of a wide public. This aspect is, sadly, missing from the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should also like to expressly draw your attention to the role of information technologies in modern theatre. Modern theatre productions increasingly incorporate modern technology in their performances. This trend deserves our attention and must certainly be included in fresh theatre policy, for it indeed pertains to a typically European task in the field of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, my group has major objections to the appeal for more financial support. We believe that enough attention is being given to this aspect by ‘Culture 2000’, the structural funds and the Socrates and Leonardo programmes, upon which the Commissioner, in fact, enlarged. Finally, more tax allowances for the mobility of those who are culturally active is a taboo subject in my group. We agree that double taxation is naturally exaggerated, but the award of special tax allowances would be a reason for us to abstain from Mrs Fraisse's entire report during the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been pronounced dead at regular intervals ever since it came into being. It lives! Deserving protection as the biotope of every democratic society, the theatre lives not only thanks to the antics of its exponents, but also thanks to public interest and childlike curiosity, and thanks to national policies. We all know that this responsibility is borne by the Fifteen, soon to be twenty-five and more.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Beazley and others who have spoken before me, I wonder whether everyone is truly aware of the enormous political and delicate task that we have been set to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The business world has galloped on ahead, but the EU's citizens are still tottering along behind integration. Europe must help where it can. Let me first thank you, Geneviève Fraisse, for your initiative, and for this wonderful report. If, within the internal market framework, we enact laws relating to culture, we must also make full use of every instrument at our disposal in the service of the many kinds of theatre – whether houses rich in tradition, buildings commandeered for alternative uses, streets between Lisbon and Helsinki, Athens and London – to protect this diversity, helping it to develop further and come to full bloom. This will call for a shared effort on the part of all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is primarily to the Member States that I appeal. We have to do away with fiscal discrimination as part of European mobility policy and as an essential contribution to integration. We have to exploit to the utmost all the options that the framework of the sixth VAT directive offers us and win over the media, for they – especially the public broadcasting institutions – are our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Commissioner, for your observations. Take this report as a mandate and as a support. Do not let it gather dust in a drawer; it is too valuable to be eaten away by moths.</p>

I shall, instead, speak about pluralism in French television, particularly as far as the so-called public service networks are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do everything necessary so that these television channels, which receive more than EUR 2 billion in subsidies from the French Government every year, at last respect the principles that are at the very core of their public service duty, in other words, the principles of democracy and respect for all political opinions. I am speaking of the so-called journalists and big prize-budget producers who are behaving in the manner of the worst campaigners of politically correct misinformation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the disgraceful behaviour of Antenne 2 and FR 3 between the two rounds of the French presidential election was unacceptable and flouts the most basic rules of the professional code of ethics of journalism. It would be a great credit to the current government to impose the necessary penalties against the two or three presenters who were guilty of professional misconduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in order to avoid confusion between journalism and propaganda in the future, each state or private television channel should organise a debate involving the main representative political views …</p>

I would prefer to speak to the matter on the agenda. I wish to congratulate Mrs Fraisse and say something on just a couple of points that have not yet been mentioned today. First of all, I am glad that a Member has taken up this matter again after an interval of ten years, in the course of which the issue has lost none of its topicality. It was in 1992 that I produced a report on the state of artists, and I can only say that I still search in vain today for the practical results that the Commission could have brought about in these ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst believing that the topics addressed today are very multi-faceted, I would nonetheless like to limit myself to two things, the first being the way in which the cultural sector is financed at both national and European level. It is the subject of politicians' speeches, but does not give rise to political action, and it is for that reason that I believe much is still amiss in this area. I would like to observe that there are two things that are in need of improvement. Firstly, the Culture 2002 programme, to which Mrs Reding has already referred, has to have more money allocated to it; if the Council of Ministers suddenly attaches such importance to culture, then it should provide funds for it. In addition, we should also bear in mind that it is the performing arts that are popular with quite specific viewers and listeners. So far, these are small-scale projects, for which the Commission has no love, but which we want because the public likes them!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the private sector must be involved more than it has been before. Patronage and sponsorship are important. There are no Budget resources available, and so we have to look for ways to enable people with a lot of money to spend it in the right way. That is why we should do more about this. I regret the way that the coalition agreements in my own country mean that it is precisely this that is to be done away with.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, artists face a very large number of technical obstacles in terms of the material they have to work with, and here in particular the Commission could really do something, for example, for circuses and small travelling theatres. Please do something in this area; it would be a great help to the performers! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recital F rightly points out that the vitality of the theatre and performing arts should not depend chiefly on public subsidies. It is, in fact, extremely important to boost the diversification of funding sources and to strengthen sponsorship policies, with the corresponding tax relief likely to attract sponsors. It is also important, however, that the performing arts develop a satisfactory business dimension. We live in a market economy and neither the State not the European Union should act as a wet nurse or a nanny for cultural creation. There is no justification whatsoever for the performing arts as a rule to be directly supported by a system of public subsidy for productions. It is more important for cultural creation to run the risks inherent to it and that public resources facilitate international promotion, distribution, greater accessibility of content through translation and subtitling and proper co-production, in the spirit of the ‘Culture 2000’ Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, every reason why artistic training from childhood, as well as contact with cultural creation in all spheres – and therefore with the arts and performing artists – judiciously promoted from school onwards, should make a decisive contribution to finding new publics, which we can expect will lead to an increase in the demand for cultural consumption likely, at least in part, to sustain the corresponding supply. What makes no sense is to reduce supply and funding for supply without seeing any significant growth in audiences, which are still lacking. Let us hope that the Fraisse Report is also a step in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
