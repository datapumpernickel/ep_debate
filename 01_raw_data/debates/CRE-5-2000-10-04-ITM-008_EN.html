I would like to express my sincere thanks to my co-rapporteur, Elizabeth Lynne, for her cooperation and constructive comments and extend that gratitude to all Members of the Article 13 Rapporteurs' Working Group.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur on the Action Programme to combat discrimination, I have tried to improve the Commission's text on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights. I should point out to Members that the Council working group agreed unanimously to recommend to the Council that the type of committee in the action programme should be modified to a mixed committee, a combination of the management and advisory procedures, thereby increasing the power of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council informed Parliament before the vote in committee, but only just before, deliberately ruling out any chance of further debate with myself or Parliament. As rapporteur I believe the original Commission proposals on the composition of the committee to be the best approach to achieving Parliament's and the programme's objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">A politician can have no greater responsibility than to be given the opportunity to redress the wrongs so often visited upon minorities. I accept that responsibility eagerly, with a determination to ensure that this action programme to combat discrimination, not just in the EU but also in the candidate countries, is not the end of a noble process, but the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">For those of us comfortable and secure enough to fashion our own working and social environment, we can only begin to imagine the appalling, and sometimes life-threatening, discrimination which people face daily. Why does such discrimination exist? It is illogical, irrational and based on ignorance. It exists because good men and women do nothing or we begin to do something and never finish. We are partial in our approach and application. We favour certain minorities and groups, but not others. We become chastened by public opinion or the media. By being chastened, we create and confirm a hierarchy of oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst compiling my report, I was sad to realise that some NGOs believe their continuation is more important than that of other groups. Only one NGO made the connection between its oppression and the oppression of all the groups cited in Article 13 and that was the UK-based Stonewall Group. That is why I, as a member of a minority, issue this stern warning that unless we recognise that discrimination against one group is discrimination against all we will achieve nothing except the proliferation of NGOs and other groups. No one group should advance at the expense of another. We must remember that we are dealing with real pain and suffering and real lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Members may have received queries from NGOs on funding and specifically core funding. I understand their concerns, but I have assurances from the Commission that NGOs will still be able to bid for funds on this and other programmes and initiatives managed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I have called for greater representation and involvement of NGOs, greater accountability to Parliament, the production of an annual report to be debated by Parliament, the highest possible degree of transparency, promotion of remembrance of the past in the fight against prejudice and the recognition of multiple discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU does not have a good record on eradicating discrimination. Now is the time to do the job and it must be done with every fibre of our being. We can never buy off the bigots; we will only encourage them further. Imagine the world through the eyes of a child growing up in a world which discriminates against it because it is female, a member of an ethnic minority, disabled or a lesbian. We have so much to do for that child and for others. This is no time for the faint-hearted. If we lack the courage to end discrimination, than at least we must have the integrity and the decency to admit it exists. As politicians, we must have the courage to be unpopular in the short term to do what is right and just in the long term. I urge Parliament to support my report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Thomas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam has been described as a sleeping giant. It forms the basis for Europe-wide measures to combat discrimination. My job was to consider the framework directive on employment and occupation, which will lead to major changes in company practice. The experience gained with the Anti-Discrimination Act in the USA ten years ago gives some idea of what lies ahead for Europe. That is why it is quite essential for the groups listed in Article 13 to be effectively protected against discrimination. At the same time, the workers’ legitimate interests need to be considered. No wonder the French Presidency of Council described this issue as one of its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination must be combated in the early stages, in cases of an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. And all the players must be involved. Human resources can only be utilised to the full in a climate of peace at the workplace. That produces an economic and social dividend. Some undertakings reject applicants for continuing and ongoing training on the pretext that they are too young or too old. Older people are discriminated against by being squeezed out of working life or by setting an upper age limit for recruitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Job applicants who come from socially disadvantaged families or urban backgrounds or who are disabled are often not accepted. The disabled are rejected on the pretext that the clients or staff cannot be expected to stand the sight of them. The underlying intention is simply to save paying for the necessary measures of assistance for the disabled. The employers then claim that hiring disabled people represents what is called undue hardship.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we defined “reasonable adjustment” very precisely in Article 2(4), together with the circumstances under which undertakings cannot reasonably be expected to pay the costs involved, i.e., if they are too small or their turnover is too low. I certainly support the call by associations representing the disabled for a separate directive. That directive could consider the differences in detail, for instance the fact that someone whose mobility is impaired has quite different problems from, say, someone who is mentally disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">A few important points in the directive are, firstly, the rules on the burden of proof. Article 9 of the draft directive states that persons who consider themselves discriminated against, whether as unsuccessful job applicants or as dismissed workers, can seek legal remedy. They need only go to a court or competent authority to establish the facts of discrimination. The respondent, however, has to prove that he did not discriminate and must be able to provide documentary evidence. To ensure that small and medium-sized undertakings in particular are not faced with an unreasonable logistical and financial outlay, we are seeking a limitation period of six to twelve months.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the right of associations to initiate proceedings. The Commission proposal, under which associations may only initiate proceedings with the complainant’s approval, has to be welcomed. Only associations, organisations or legal entities representing the interests of employees and the groups protected by Article 13 should be entitled to initiate proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the mediating agency. In the event of disputes, independent mediating agencies must be set up to consider the interests of both the employers and the employees. Many problems may well be resolved internally, before going to the lengths of legal proceedings. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided by a majority that these agencies should be set up in the EU Member States rather than setting up a central body at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the involvement of the two sides of industry. Since they are mainly responsible for settling questions of discrimination at the workplace, the social partners are best placed to work out viable solutions. And, of course, the NGOs should be involved, although the autonomy of the social partners must not be put in question at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, religious communities, perhaps one of the most sensitive areas of our directive. The question is whether Member States can allow different treatment when it comes to religion or belief. I think they can! These communities make vital contributions to society in terms of social facilities such as nurseries, hospitals and educational institutions. They see the danger of having to hire people who do not identify with their values and convictions. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted by a large majority in favour of the compromise under which different treatment does not represent discrimination in cases where religion and belief are major requirements for the performance of a job.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU. We will find out at tomorrow’s vote whether we manage to build bridges, following the excellent cooperation of all the rapporteurs on this article – and let me just mention Mrs Swiebel as standing for all of them – and after the intensive discussions with the Commission and the Council Presidency. There is a real chance that we will persuade the Commission and the Council to incorporate many of our recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found it very useful working so closely together on Article 13 across the board under the Hughes' procedure. The Action Programme must enable groups that are discriminated against to take action themselves. It must ensure equal access to the programme for disabled people and it must make sure that funding does not fall below the preparatory actions. We must also prepare further for anti-discrimination legislation on all grounds in the future, including a disability directive. It has been brought home very strongly to me how we much need one in the light of the Article 13 hearings.</p>
<p class="contents">Jenny was from the Access Charter, she was the coordinator for the group and I invited her to the hearings on Article 13. To start, with she could not get into Parliament except through the swing doors. Next we booked a disabled access hotel only to find that a single bed was put across the bathroom. She tried to get a taxi in Brussels and was refused. She tried to get into a restaurant to have a meal and was refused entry on the grounds that her physical appearance would put other diners off. The final indignity was that when she went to Brussels airport she was subjected to a full body search and then, when she remonstrated, was told: "Have a nice trip, I hope your plane crashes." That is why we need anti-discrimination legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, on the employment directive, I would like to congratulate Thomas Mann for an excellent report. Again this was a close working relationship. This is ground-breaking legislation and it is a gigantic step forward but we must go even further. I also urge you to vote for the amendment by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on age. Discrimination on any grounds is wrong, equally wrong. We must vote for both these pieces of legislation tomorrow and at long last demonstrate our commitment to stamping out discrimination in all its forms.</p>

Indeed, equal treatment is a fundamental constitutional right which forms one of the cornerstones of the European Union. They also form part of a practical policy because directives and action programmes encourage the Member States to fight discrimination on the basis of the same guiding principles and because the Commission can fulfil its role as Guardian of the Treaties but also as a pioneer in the social debate. The above also highlights the link between both instruments, the directive and the Action Programme. Not only do the social activities which underpin the social programme complement the directive’s legal framework, they also need to generate the extra information, the expertise and the support structure to complement and improve this legal framework. I hope to illustrate the need for this in the rest of my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The two proposals which the European Parliament is discussing today are both based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty. This Article 13 has now taken on a central role in the equal treatment framework of the European Union. It thus follows in the footsteps of the current Article 141, formerly Article 119, which lay – and still lies – at the basis of European legislation to combat sex discrimination. There are, however, major differences. First of all, we are dealing with a different decision-making procedure involving the European Parliament which, with regard to the implementation of Article 13, cannot yet fulfil its role of co-legislator.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a whole raft of pieces of legislation has now been drafted concerning the equal treatment of men and women, the oldest dating back 25 years. An overhaul of this legislation is therefore overdue.</p>
<p class="contents">This summer, the Council adopted a directive to combat discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin. This directive provides a higher level of protection, and is wider in scope, than both existing equal treatment legislation on men and women and the draft directive which we are discussing here today.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have always argued that this fragmented approach gives the wrong political signal, as if there might be some sort of hierarchy in discrimination. A patchwork of anti-discrimination rules also has a detrimental effect when it comes to drafting coherent legislation and also forms a threat to what has been achieved in European equal treatment theory.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that this viewpoint has been taken on board by the rapporteur. I would therefore like to extend a heartfelt thanks to Mr Mann for his open attitude and for the constructive consultation we have entered into. Partly thanks to this, we now have a large number of legal, technical amendments before us which aim to guarantee a level of equal protection against discrimination on the basis of race on the one hand and on the basis of religion, handicap, age and sexual orientation on the other. This touches on topics such as indirect discrimination, harassment, positive action, burden of proof, etc. The role of the so-called independent monitoring body is also called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">As already stated, the level of protection concerning the fight against sex discrimination should also be brought into line with the highest standard. This is the gist of the directive against race discrimination which was adopted recently. Fortunately, the Commission has provided for this by submitting its proposal for reparative legislation. The European Parliament, in its role of co-legislator, will be able to get its teeth into this shortly. I would at this stage like to offer my services to the appointed rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The current picture is also fragmented in terms of scope or area of application. The directive on race discrimination has the widest scope, and mainly applies to social life outside the labour market. The existing set of directives concerning sex discrimination pertains to labour, remuneration and social security, whilst the current measures against discrimination on the other grounds specified in Article 13 apply to a much narrower area.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Commission pledged its willingness this summer to compile a draft directive also to combat sex discrimination outside the employment sphere, but I cannot understand why such an announcement for the other grounds of discrimination has not yet been forthcoming. This is the background to Amendments Nos 19 and 35, which contain a horizon provision ...</p>

This principle, as well as the prohibition of all types of discrimination, have also been included in the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now comment on the fight against discrimination which we are examining today along with the proposal for a directive. The programme, despite being modest financially, can play a significant role in strengthening the mechanisms for combating discrimination and will achieve its aims if there is coordination, at both a Community level and within the Member States, with other programmes and initiatives in the same field. It is the Member States who are most directly responsible for the eradication of discriminatory practices and it is therefore essential that we incorporate all our accumulated experience and <span class="italic">acquis </span>in this field, and that this Parliament ensures that it is effectively monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">We must support the social partners, the NGOs and other institutions which are pursuing the same objective, and we must also demand rigour in the selection of the actions and organisations which we are to support financially. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the budgetary pressures that exist within category 3 expenditure, which includes this and other programmes. Although the present legal basis releases appropriations for new preparatory actions, their funding within this category could lead to a reduction in appropriations for other policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that, despite the commitment from the Commission, there is no express mention in the programme of technical assistance costs which are nevertheless envisaged in the financial statement. For this reason, the sum total of the appropriations must be allocated to financing operating expenditure. The citizens expect us to implement concrete measures. The fight against discrimination is something which concerns us all. In my view, this programme operates within a very general scope. Without prejudicing its objectives, we should support actions which are more in touch with the realities of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal for a directive, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Thomas Mann on the excellent work he has done. Balance, moderation and legal expertise were required and I believe that his report reflects those qualities. The common objective of eradicating discrimination in the field of employment can and must be pursued from many angles, but it is clear that the role to be played makes it essential to establish a minimal legal framework which must be consistent with all the measures to combat discrimination and, in particular, with the directive on race.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States already have a legal framework, both in the constitutional field and in ordinary legislation, and experience of the measures adopted in the fight against discrimination, which must be taken into account. Therefore, the concepts of framework directive and minimal directive are the key to interpreting the present proposal for a directive. However, the establishment of a perfect legal architecture which prohibits discrimination and protects the victims of it, does not guarantee its eradication in practice nor the elimination of its causes. It is therefore essential, amongst other things, to encourage and promote the culture of dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of penalties laid down in the directive must guarantee that it acts as a deterrent<span class="bold"> </span>and that it is effective in the eradication of discriminatory practices. However, as well as the penalties, the declaration of invalidity of activities is also important in the case of serious violations of the principles laid down in the directive. The exception of a difference in treatment which may be made on ideological or religious grounds or for reasons of age must bring together the law which protects certain public and private organisations with scrupulous respect for the principle of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a framework directive is necessary but not sufficient, and we will have the opportunity to improve its mechanisms once the implementation period is over. The fight against discrimination will be a long one and we must therefore be attentive to the results of the measures we are debating today.</p>

This package of legislation will open a new and radical chapter in the EU's history of commitment to securing equal opportunities and combating the modern scourge of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament will send a clear message in our vote to all our citizens that we intend to improve Member States' record in ensuring respect for equal treatment, irrespective of age, race, disability and sexual orientation. For individuals in my constituency this legislation is long overdue. However, I regret that some of the Christian Democrat Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs, in voting against the employment directive, saw it as unnecessary because it would, and I quote: "restrict freedom of choice in private life". But I ask you: whose freedom? The freedom of those who continue to discriminate against individuals? That is a freedom that this House should not seek to protect – it is neither Christian nor democratic!</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, their view is that cases of discrimination are not so numerous as to warrant any legislation. Perhaps they ought to talk more to their local constituents and those who suffer from discrimination. It is also best to give local examples to show how this legislation is relevant. In my constituency a retired head teacher from Manchester who is over 70 years of age, with much experience, was appointed to serve on the police authority by Manchester City Council. Following a complaint about her age, she was told she was too old to take up the position and not eligible, according to the current British Police Act. This legislation, therefore, is good for individuals like her. UK employment legislation will now have to be reviewed to ensure that ability, not age, determines who gets the job. Indeed the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, is now reviewing the legislation to remove such anomalies of discrimination. Discrimination, in whatever forms it exists, whichever group it affects, is wasteful and unacceptable, as the Confederation of British Industry has said. Again I quote: "some enlightened employers are realising the potential of employing people from right across the board, from all walks of life.</p>
<p class="contents">In another company in my constituency, B&amp;Q, the grey revolution has begun. In Macclesfield one of their stores is staffed by only over 50 year olds and their oldest employee is 86! I think that is a very good example to follow. This legislation will encourage employers to seek to use the talents, the ability, the experience of all people in our society. It is the biggest overhaul of discriminatory legislation that we will ever see in Europe and back in our own Member States. Yes, it will create changes in employment law, yes, it will create changes in general legislation and for the courts, but I do not believe this Parliament or the European Union can shy away from making those changes which will open up a world of opportunity for groups which have suffered for too long from the cancer of discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the kind of legislation we are looking at today will have a big impact on peoples' lives and make people understand that here in Strasbourg and Brussels we do things that make a difference. I should like to congratulate the Commission on its work in bringing forward these proposals so speedily and the professionalism of the civil servants who helped us bring these reports forward. They have done an excellent job.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the specifics of the report, I would like to thank Mr Mann who took on board most of the comments from the Committee on Industry, particularly those concerning multiple discrimination – as in the case of women, who are the target of other discrimination. I hope the Commission will look carefully at gender discrimination legislation in the light of this new directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly they took on board our comments on the involvement of NGOs. It is very important that organisations representing the people affected are listened to, because they will help us make the transition from fine words here today to practical policies that work in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Cashman's report, I would like to congratulate my colleague on his first report. If this is a sign of what is to come, I hope he does many more. From the point of view of my committee, it is very important that anything the action plan does in the field of work on age and disability complements the work undertaken as part of the research programmes, the framework programmes. There is not enough money in the action programme to replace that work which takes place in the fifth framework which will hopefully continue in any other framework programmes, but we need to make sure they work together.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am pleased that the Commission has recognised the need to continue core funding for European NGOs. I do not consider that the main aim of European programmes is to support these organisations, but without them it would be very difficult for us to hear the voices of those target groups. I hope special attention will be paid to the needs of the disabled community, who have many different issues they would like to see tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are those in this House – I have heard them in my committee and elsewhere – who argue that we do not need this kind of legislation, it is too burdensome, it is a lawyers' charter. Fortunately many of those people are away this week at the British seaside. They have other things to do, so they cannot be here, but we should not be surprised at these comments and we should take no heed of them. We hear them every time we have legislation like this. We heard them years ago on equal pay for women, we heard them on all equal opportunities legislation, on improvements in maternity leave, we heard them in connection with the race directive before the summer, and so we should carry on regardless. This is good legislation. Mrs McCarthy said that good employers want this kind of legislation. Citizens want it too. I congratulate the Commission and my colleagues who drew up the report. We hope that this goes through rapidly and that the ministers will make rapid progress too.</p>

After so many years of talk, we finally have an initiative to tackle discrimination in different areas more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mr Mann on the results of his work on the present report. It is a sensitive topic. Everyone is agreed that discrimination should be fought but opinions differ as to how, to what extent and by what means. Discrimination can have different consequences for men and women. I am pleased that what is now before us affords women better protection than the existing directive on the principle of equal treatment, especially with regard to vocational training, employment and employment conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight the importance of a person in whom employees can confide within an organisation and the importance of an independent body to which people and organisations can turn in the event of complaints concerning discrimination and intimidation. Positive experiences have been gained in this respect in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the attention given to the problem of discrimination against the elderly. It is a growing problem, especially since the number of elderly people is growing in our society and they happen to be the most dynamic generation of elderly people ever.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by commenting on Article 4 (2) concerning discrimination on the basis of religion and belief, which is a sensitive area, particularly within our Group. It touches upon the theme of pluralism, the importance of which to the proper functioning of our democracy is recognised by many. But in the discussions on pluralism, most of the time we talk about doing justice to the different opinions of individuals. There is far less openness towards, and thought for, individuals wanting to express their opinions through organisations, for, in those instances, there is hardly any respect for pluralism but, rather, intolerance and discrimination, especially with regard to organisations founded on religious or ideological bases. I applaud the recommendation of the Mann report to offer ideological organisations the opportunity to prescribe the functions required of staff with this background in mind. It is a compromise, but one which enjoys wide support within Parliament. I urgently call on the Commission to adopt this recommendation and to do justice to the tolerance and pluralism desired by the representatives of so many States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is the reason why the PPE-DE Group would perhaps have preferred are more compact and occasionally more intelligible text, which at least avoided some of the repetition, for, as the saying goes, ‘He who grasps at too much loses everything.’ Indeed, parts of this text refer, in particular, to equality between men and women, giving rise to a specific policy or quite novel concepts such as gender-specific perspectives, or concepts which occasionally, and this is one of our fears, extend the scope of discrimination too far.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that the report tabled by our fellow Member, Mr Cashman contains many good things, particularly the space accorded to NGOs. I think it most important to rely on the support of this network of partners, but we must be selective in our choices and, especially, avoid being exclusive. In committee, I have had occasion to make a stand against the fact that there may also be experts outside NGOs that have something to say. Need I point out in this House that the principle role, particularly in terms of education, belongs to governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this Community policy, Article 13, does not lead to a situation where the solution lies necessarily in more money. I believe the solution lies in analysis of the use of the money, and not necessarily in making unlimited appropriations available.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we in the PPE-DE Group place great hope in the policy of assessment and coordination, and one of our proposals is that the fight against discrimination should give rise to a specific report to be presented before Parliament, which will account for the money and the use of the Community money which has been invested.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is my concluding remark, the definition of the causes which has been given and, indeed, adopted in the Charter which we shall have to adopt in November, is an acceptable one, making it possible to resolve a great many tensions within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group therefore lends its unqualified support to the report and we would particularly like to thank the co-rapporteurs, Mr Thomas Mann and Mrs Joke Swiebel for their sterling work and also congratulate them on the excellent cooperation within the respective committees.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, in fact, like to seize the opportunity also to congratulate Mr Cashman, because although directives are important, action programmes are, of course, essential too in terms of the support they lend to directives. The speed with which the institutions have deployed the new Amsterdam powers, Commissioner, show that the European Union is still in the vanguard of equal opportunities, and I would like to extend my express thanks to the European Commission for this. Moreover, I hope that the French Presidency will be indulged and that this directive and the action programme will now be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to air a few concerns regarding this directive which are of particular importance for my group. Parliament rightly chose to play the trump cards which we already have in the form of existing directives on equal treatment, those on gender and those on race and ethnic origin, and I am particularly pleased with the sound descriptions of indirect discrimination, positive action and the principle of shared burden of proof. We were also right to decide against including sex discrimination in this directive because there is already a separate European directive on sex discrimination, which will, in fact, be revised further to the Commission proposals and which is founded on a much stronger legal basis, about which Parliament, in fact, may decide in codecision. What is important, however, is that the European Parliament should advocate that double discrimination, which often victimises older women and disabled women, should be tackled here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, my group applauds the decision to delete the non-exhaustive list of so-called justifications of differences of treatment on the grounds of age. This would only open the floodgates to so-called discriminations already warranted in advance. We are also delighted with the provision in the directive which stipulates that equal treatment for the disabled also means that companies are expected to make the necessary adjustments within the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say how excellent this work is. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for the cooperation, but our task is not finished. Let us hope – and I am relying on you, Commissioner – that the European Commission will now come forward with proposals, pursuant to Article 13, to fight discrimination on grounds other than those to be found in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This first year of the 21st century has shown the EU institutions determined to entrench non-discrimination as a basic European value and fundamental human right.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to concentrate especially on the Mann report and specifically Article 4. This would permit continued discrimination where it is an essential or genuine requirement. In particular, it provides that there can be occupational discrimination on religious grounds. This is clearly a powerful exception to the rule on non-discrimination. It must be justified on tight criteria and not abused.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the committee's amendments to that end, although I would prefer that Member States should be permitted but not obliged to offer such religious privileges. I have requested a split vote on the word 'shall' for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that discrimination on religious grounds should not be a pretext to discriminate against employees on other grounds, for example, because they are homosexual. I am sure that sensible and moderate religious organisations would not seek to do so to exploit this as a loophole. But we must not allow fundamentalists with prejudiced views of any religion to allow their views to prevail against the non-discrimination standards of secular society.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that there is a rising tide of lobbies in politics which are seeking to extend the grip of religion in the public sphere. There is a proper sphere for religion. The compromise in this report allows plenty of space to religious organisations and it must not be abused. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that so many different forms of discrimination exist in our societies confirms the importance of the Action Programme that is the subject of Mr Cashman’s report. The Action Programme is a key instrument for supporting the Community in developing a common strategy to combat discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept seeing women and men still not having equal rights at the dawn of the 21st century, seeing the disabled socially marginalised, or people being excluded from society because of their sexual orientation and branded as different. The right of all human beings to equality before the law and protection against discrimination is a basic right. That basic right is fundamental to the ability of any democratic society to function. Legal provisions are an important component, but cannot be the only one, in the fight against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community must supplement them with political and practical programmes that can actually be implemented. So we must support grassroots initiatives, improve information about discrimination and underpin the political programmes. Only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life. That has to be in the interest of all of us!</p>
<p class="contents">In that spirit I call on my fellow delegates, especially those on the Conservative benches of this House, to endorse the two rapporteurs’ reports at tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to focus on one point of the Action Plan which, as I said in committee, I feel leaves large gaps: the inclusion of Turkey. It is not that Turkey should not be included in this Action Plan, but we are financing a State – which I may define as criminal – without any insistence at all that these funds should be used to eradicate the worst form of discrimination, namely discrimination against the Kurdish-speaking Turkish citizens. Therefore, we are providing funds for Turkey to use as it likes without any obligation to eliminate the worst form of discrimination, which is a combination of all forms of discrimination in that, if there is discrimination against Kurds in general now, discrimination against Kurdish women, people of Kurdish origin with deviant sexual tendencies and disabled people of Kurdish origin will soon follow.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are. We would have liked to compel or, at any rate, prompt Turkey to eradicate the genuinely widespread discrimination currently practised in that State. We are therefore extremely confused regarding this point, and we call upon the Commission to ensure, when monitoring the ways that the funding is used, that Turkey is not merely pretending to wipe out or combat more minor forms of discrimination without making any effort at all to fight that basic discrimination which, when all is said and done, is at the root of a great many of Europe's misfortunes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the last part-session, Parliament adopted a resolution on the fight against discriminatory, violent and repressive racism. This resolution stated that racism is a crime which can be committed not only through actions but also through statements or the publication of messages, and called for more legal instruments to prosecute political parties whose programmes jeopardise the principles of non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced – for our history, your history, the history of Europe makes it plain – that your strategy of prohibition and repression which is based on restricting freedom of expression and association, on strengthening repressive tools such as the police, social monitoring and telecommunications, on allocating funds and on creating monitoring centres, will create the perfect conditions for a fresh explosion of the phenomena that you wish, or say you wish to combat.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that the first action of the members of the Bonino List this parliamentary term was to promote a proposal for a resolution on the fight against discrimination based on sex. We applied for funding through Action Plans, which usually amounts to aid to NGOs, which are often reduced to little more than state-controlled bodies. We did not call for illiberal or illegal reversals of the burden of proof. We have proposed a number of amendments to the Mann report, amendments which make some of the points referred to more democratic and more liberal and ensure that they advocate civil liberties. The amendments remove the reversal of the burden of proof, the involvement of employers' associations in dialogue between the two sides of industry and limit sanctions to civil and administrative penalties, not criminal penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that whenever prohibition has been applied in Europe it has been necessary to take a step backwards. It happened in Germany when you wanted to oppress the pro-nazi parties, it happened with Austria recently, and you were forced to step back, and it happened with the Technical Group of Independent Members.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, as the great democracies of the English-speaking world teach us, racism and discrimination must be fought with liberal democracy, not by restrictions and the gradual erosion of freedom of opinion, freedom of expression, freedom of association and economic freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As it happens, my group has never been in favour of including Article 13 in the Treaty, not because we condone discrimination but because we believed it was undesirable to raise this topic to European level. A great deal has already been regulated in this field, both internationally and nationally.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is rather reticent in its proposals, but from the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, it does appear that there is a desire to go a lot further: there is call for an overarching European anti-discrimination policy, whereby the policy of national States is monitored by the Commission. The idea does not appeal to me at all. Why would a centralised Europe do better than a national government, which is much closer to its citizens and enjoys a far greater degree of democracy and supporting power?</p>
<p class="contents">A sensitive issue is the clash with other constitutional rights, such as freedom of religion and belief, and the right to respect for privacy. I have a feeling that these rights are being infringed upon by Article 4 of the Commission proposal and the amendment tabled in this respect by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Religion and belief are not separate entities. Faith is, by definition, professed within a community and, by extension, will find expression in people’s attitude to life. This is why organisations, schools and nursing homes which express a particular identity have been established by and for people who share the same belief. Managerial and executive staff will give corporate shape to this belief. Could the Commissioner explain why the Commission is not taking this on board?</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has not done a great deal to clarify matters. It appears to be putting more distance between beliefs and practical attitude to life and, as a result, institutions are even further restricted in living out and maintaining their own identities.</p>
<p class="contents">Absolute freedom of religion is impossible, as is absolute equality. Discrimination in the sense of treating people as inferior, taunting them and putting them at a disadvantage is an evil that must be eradicated. But we must be careful that, in striving to protect the weaker members of society, legislators do not oppress other groups that hold certain minority beliefs. This would breach major guarantees in the Treaties and constitutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The President of Italy addressed this House today and I was interested when he said that it was not the aim of this Union to negate national values. Some of the matters before us today are destructive to national values. We have a proposal that elevates homosexuality to the same position as holy marriage. To achieve that, vast numbers of religious people who believe the holy scriptures are to be discriminated against in a most sinister and dictatorial manner.</p>
<p class="contents">What about those people whose religious beliefs are based on the holy scriptures, their churches, schools, organisations and hospices? You might not like it that they believe the scriptures, you might not like what the scriptures say, but they have a right to hold those views. The Bible makes it perfectly clear that those who abuse themselves with mankind cannot enter the Kingdom of God. Some in this room would say that is bigotry. But that is what these people believe because they are tied and anchored to the holy scriptures. They also believe what the Apostle Paul said, that acts between men and men are unseemly and are the result of lust not of love.</p>
<p class="contents">How can these religious people be forced to employ those who, by profession and practice, advocate such anti-scriptural behaviour? Are there going to be safeguards written into this legislation for those that believe that sex should only be between male and female within the marriage bond? These proposals strike a blow at the sanctity of marriage and the sanctity of the home and they should be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has submitted an Action Plan until the year 2006. It is very ambitious, highly committed and very concrete in terms of its objective, actions and individual measures. It is a programme that deserves full support and I am convinced we will be successful if we pursue that programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, have problems with Mr Cashman’s report, which is peppered with 17 proposed amendments. I want to raise several points in it that worry me. First there is the proposed wider-ranging definition relating to the implementation of the programme, which goes beyond the comprehensive definition. I think that would create greater uncertainty because we would no longer know who could actually be assisted in line with the Commission programme. That produces the risk that the insufficient resources will then have to be spread too thinly over too many actions. I fear for the effectiveness of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is the problem that NGOs, important as they may be, are being asked to be involved in implementing the programme regardless of their size, nature and activities. Over and above this, they are also being asked to be responsible for monitoring; and if the NGOs are core funded up to 90% by the Union, the problem is compounded if the NGOs monitor themselves. I do not think we should ask too much of anybody. What we ought to do at all events is to give full support to the Commission’s highly committed programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, we discussed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and today, in discussing Community initiatives, we are debating the matter of combating discrimination. We are thereby boosting the positions of the European Union regarding the practical situations experienced by European nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, straight away, to emphasise the importance of these two texts: on the one hand, the directive, acting as it does on the state of the law and, on the other hand, the action programme, because it makes it possible to implement effectively new practices intended for adoption on a widespread basis. In this regard, I cannot accept the muddle that some parties are making of the necessary anti-discrimination measures, equal treatment and the mention of other cases of prohibition. I do not think we can mix things up in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive discussed in the Mann report is a key one, and I should like to discuss it briefly. It seeks to boost the principle of equal treatment at the same time as reducing the number of opportunities for exemptions, which we think excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return to the subject of the exemption for religion. I should like to express our reservations on this difficult issue and restate our commitment to the principle of secularism, especially in the context of the fight against discrimination. This seems fundamental to us, particularly after incorporating the questions of activities in the social or health fields. The desire for action is a matter of jurisdiction, not religious belief.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word on the discussion which may ensue on the need to maintain statistics on the subject. They are essential. Let us beware, nonetheless, lest these statistics be used against the men and women they concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has assessed all this with positive results, particularly focusing on the activity of Parliament, which insisted, in addition and above all, on preventive action as well as good practice. We felt that the objectives relating to enhancing in-depth understanding of the issue and its new forms, scale and development and, most importantly, action supporting those who have to implement these good practices, were entirely convincing. Yet we were even more impressed by fact that, at the end of the report, provision was made for an evaluation of the outcome of the processes and programmes, for this is also a guarantee of fairness, impartiality and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would especially like to focus on the opportunities provided for the Member States, who have to concentrate on high-quality actions, to work autonomously. This means that, for the first time, a different line is being adopted: we are not doling out funding left, right and centre but evaluating the quality of the operations and insisting on high quality; the operations themselves must then be monitored and their results published. I feel that this is a highly positive and constructive process, considering, also, that the results can be made available to the public and used to improve the quality of subsequent actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I too would like to touch on the issue of exception made for religious organisations. I am pleased that it has been raised in this House. In effect, I feel that this is a mistake and that the exemption warrants discussion and reflection. I would just like to highlight a point once and for all. In my country, Italy, a teacher colleague of mine who was Catholic by religion but taught in a State school was dismissed because she became pregnant, she did not have an abortion and she was not married.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that such a thing is possible, I would ask you whether it would have happened if the religious authorities were not endowed with this discretionary power? I would add that, paradoxically, if this teacher had had an abortion, no-one would have realised anything and she would not have lost her job. Instead, having shown respect for the sanctity of life and her right to motherhood, she was dismissed, a victim of discrimination. This, in my opinion, is disgraceful. If she had been a man, I may add, she would not have had to worry about what she did in her private life since a way has not yet been found to make men pregnant! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that it is a complex, sensitive and controversial area and it combines at least three of those elements I was always taught you were not supposed to discuss in polite society: politics, sex and religion, along with the equally important issues of age and disability. The importance people attach to this has been reflected in the fact that I have received more lobbying on this directive than on any other so far in this session and from a wider range of people.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this work, based on Article 13, is to make equality of opportunity a reality by removing that smiling face that so often cloaks prejudice and bigotry, predominantly in the workplace. That is a challenge to all of us because we all judge people on initial impressions. Employers will now have to be clear and transparent in all aspects of their employment policy and practice and able to justify the choices they make on the basis of the real job requirements. They will also be expected to respond to the needs of the potential workforce, particularly in the area of disability.</p>
<p class="contents">My group welcomes both the framework directive and the proposed Community action programme and sees them as an important step towards tackling prejudice in other aspects of people's lives. For that reason we shall be supporting Amendment No 18 to the Mann report which calls for Member States to repeal all penal code provisions discriminating against homosexuals. We know that that is not within the scope of the directive but we think it is an important marker because if, quite rightly, discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is not to be permitted in the field of employment, then we should not be supporting the potential criminalisation of employees for what they do in privacy and in a consenting relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns have been raised with me about the potential interpretation of the explanatory notes to Article 1, which again may seem a bit obscure, but these distinguish between sexual orientation and behaviour. I would ask the Commission to clarify this point. Does it mean that you can still suffer discrimination in the workplace if you engage in homosexual activities in your private life? Or, does it mean, as I would hope, that we should learn the lessons from the Clinton experience and all behave appropriately in the workplace, whatever our sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">In dealing with religion, my group welcomes Amendment No 37 to the Mann report. It is important that, while we recognise the desire of organisations based on a particular religion or belief to employ people who share their views, it is also right that this desire should not become a reason to deny employment to people who are perfectly qualified to carry out a job which is not directly connected to that belief and who conduct themselves appropriately while at work. There are very few jobs where having a particular belief system is an essential qualification. Being the British Monarchy is one of them. Driving a school bus for a religious foundation is not. I found it particularly offensive to be asked that I should support changes which would make it possible for any religious body to deny any employment to homosexuals. I would urge any group campaigning for the right to discriminate against another group to consider how such freedom might also work against them and to consider if they think that would be just.</p>
<p class="contents">Age discrimination is also rife and no voluntary code can really combat gratuitous discrimination. Article 5, as it currently stands, has been criticised for seeming to justify what it aims to combat. That is why we shall be supporting Amendment No 38 which limits itself to essentials on the basis of a strictly defined legitimate aim.

I therefore, obviously, welcome today’s directive, whose application must also become the norm.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore confine my remarks to the limitations which, I feel, still remain in spite of everything. Firstly, the burden of proof. The directive takes a step forward in shifting the burden of proof but does not go as far as to reverse the situation. Yet, should the law not provide the victims of discrimination with better means to escape the isolation they too often find themselves in? How is it possible to think that a job applicant, rejected in such circumstances, has the same resources as a firm, especially a large undertaking, to defend himself and prove that he has indeed been a victim of discrimination? Moreover, if it were compulsory for firms to prove that their practices were non-discriminatory, they would doubtless think twice on the matter when recruiting.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking particularly here of the discrimination affecting third-country nationals, but also the second-generation children from immigrant families. There are many examples of this in France. Given an identical curriculum vitae, identical education and identical career, a young person with a French sounding name has four to five times the chance of being recruited than a young person with a North African sounding name, and twice that of a young person with a Portuguese or Spanish sounding name. This is the hierarchy of discrimination. In a Europe that is supposed to be multicultural where diversity is respected, we must ensure that our deeds live up to our words.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end on the subject of the exemption granted to religious bodies. I would like to say that I consider the exemption of Article 4(2) to be very dangerous and perhaps even a legal cover for the most reactionary ideas. Earlier, the idea of abuse of the provisions was mentioned. I feel that this may provide a major foothold for those most reactionary ideas. Mr Paisley’s objectionable intervention earlier with regard to homosexuals bears witness to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not just discrimination against men and women at work. In France, for example, men are not allowed to teach in primary education. That is a case of blatant discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, however, far more significant in philosophical, legal and sociological terms. Legally speaking, there are general texts condemning discrimination everywhere. Yesterday, for example, the Charter of Fundamental Rights condemned discrimination, not just racial discrimination but even, according to the Charter, discrimination on the basis of birth. In affirming the principle of equality, all the constitutions of the world virtually establish a principle of constitutional <span class="italic">jus cogens</span>, since discrimination is prohibited everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, for forty years there have been texts in existence which are actually based on discrimination. In Geneva in 1963, the first of these, UNCTAD, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, established the principle of compensatory inequalities or, in other words, discrimination. Our own Lomé Convention itself is based on discrimination in favour of the Caribbean and Pacific States. Our entire dispute with the United States, moreover, has arisen because we wanted positive discrimination in favour of our own ACP banana producers whereas the United States wanted an egalitarian system which would serve the interests of multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe itself, with the GSP, the System of Generalised Preferences, which leads us unilaterally to give up our customs duties to the benefit of a whole series of States, is based on discrimination. And the national laws in our 15 countries also practice discrimination, including the Socialist France of the Socialist Mr Jospin. In 1999, with regard to New Caledonia, a preference was established with regard to employment on the basis of ethnicity, on the basis of race. So New Caledonia operates a preference based on skin colour.</p>
<p class="contents">In the urban suburbs of French cities, there are tax free zones, based on ethnicity once again, for these areas are dominated by specific ethnic populations. And that is without mentioning the United States where, thirty years ago, the Supreme Court invented the principle of ‘affirmative action’. On a sociological basis, moreover, there is discrimination according to birth. In this House, Mrs Ana de Palacio Vallelersundi has a sister who is a Commissioner in the European Commission. If she were not born Ana de Palacio Vallelersundi, do you think the two sisters would now be in these two places? Not everyone in the Olympic Games gets through to the final. There is no right entitling a person to go to the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in sociological terms, there is the risk of abuse. The principle of non-discrimination is a fine one, Mr President, but it also has a flip side. I must therefore warn you, the situation is not as simple as you may imagine. This principle of ….</p>

As shadow rapporteur for the European People's Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I welcomed the Council's decision to establish a Community Action Plan to fight discrimination. I feel that the great step taken towards consolidating the new powers conferred by Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community in order to fight this very phenomenon of discrimination is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, I agree with the emphasis placed on the development and growth of cultural tools to fight discrimination: in my opinion, we must combat discrimination with a culture of non-discrimination, making up-to-the-minute, accessible information available to all the citizens of all the Member States. In fact, information and awareness campaigns are vital in this area: they must act as hammers to forge new mentalities and bring about a new way of thinking and behaving, in order to drive out those prejudices which are still widespread and to ensure equal rights for all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I consider that the overall funds allocated to this programme are inadequate and I call, in particular, upon the Commissioner to secure an increase in funding. The amount should be at least equal to the sums made available for the preparations for this programme, to make it possible to implement it fully and effectively. I would remind you of the additional cost of implementing the programme in respect of the more vulnerable categories such as the elderly, people with varying abilities<span class="bold"> </span>and the older unemployed. These categories represent 25% of the Union's population. This is a potential which must not be underestimated and the integration of these categories could prove beneficial to the economy as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The directive under consideration covers the gamut of salaried employment and independent occupations and professions. The report by Mr Mann was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This was due both to his consummate preparation and his willingness to cooperate on the necessary amendments. For that, I congratulate him most sincerely.</p>
<p class="contents">The first positive aspect of the directive is the comprehensive way in which it tackles discrimination, which is especially important for the proper implementation of the directive. The directive has a second advantage in that it revalorises the experiences gained from the ban on discrimination on grounds of sex and uses the same tools and concepts, for example direct and indirect discrimination, effective legal protection and shifting the burden of proof. What is more, it revalorises the tradition of urging positive action aimed at compensating for disadvantages in order to integrate specific persons into the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">These aspects of the directive, together with the fact that, a short time ago, Directive 2000 was adopted, are proof of the avowed will of the European Union to guarantee an open society, free from predetermined categorisations and, most importantly, from the stigma of racism, which has its roots deep in European history. It is not by chance that the Action Programme gives priority to understanding the phenomenon of arbitrary discrimination, thereby seeking to tackle the issue at its very core, which is covert racism. This arises partly from fear and partly from a well-established tradition, which, it must be said, is one of the negative aspects of European civilisation and one of the main causes of unrest, both civil and between nations. That is why this directive must be incorporated into our cultural development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These texts mark a step forward. They are going to give the anti-racist associations and the trade unions greater control regarding instances of discrimination, but I feel that now it is going to be necessary to make application of these directives, and compliance with labour law, mandatory by stepping up the number of inspections and by penalising offending employers. This means harmonising the acquired rights in a positive way in order to protect the weakest and most oppressed on the labour market and not, for example, in the name of equality, authorising night work for women. It is going to be necessary to prohibit, at last, the repression of the union movement, in the form it is tending to develop in Europe, in the French postal service for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I feel that, as employers, States should provide an example by doing away with discrimination against the recruitment of non-Community employees in the public service, as this type of discrimination condemns the immigrants they do employ to endless job instability. Genuine socio-economic integration, however, presupposes the equality of rights which cannot exist without better political representation, and for that we should have to regularise the situation of illegal immigrants and grant all immigrants the right to vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The applicant countries must be given every assistance in meeting the Copenhagen criteria and in integrating as full and equal members into the European Union.

More resources must be made available to them in order to bolster their attempts to strengthen their democratic institutions and to eliminate discrimination, especially discrimination that is rooted in race or ethnic origin, or religious conviction, which has caused so much pain and bloodshed recently and taken so many human lives in the Balkans.</p>

It is therefore important to press forward with the two legislative initiatives that are now being debated, while improving them in certain respects and increasing the funds set aside for financing the programme, thus reflecting the political importance of this fight against discrimination. It is not enough for equality to be guaranteed in law. As we all know, the causes of discrimination must be rooted out right from the start – and the work of prevention is just as vital – through information, education and training in the promotion of equality and the fight against prejudice, changing attitudes through the various forms of positive action, particularly favouring groups that are discriminated against, or by appealing to the relevant authorities whenever employers persist in discrimination. With regard to the burden of proof, it is important that it should be up to the employer to prove that there has been no violation of the principle of equality, whereas the worker should only have to present the case of discrimination of which he or she has been the victim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Groups which are in the firing line are those groups which peopled the concentration camps during the Second World War, namely people of certain religious beliefs, for example Jehovah’s witnesses. I am thinking of people of a particular race: Jews, gypsies, etc; I am also thinking of the disabled, people who could no longer keep up, the elderly; all these people were at risk of being put in a concentration camp. This is also true for homosexuals. So those who claim here that Europe does not need to lay down in a directive the values which we all aim to defend are mistaken.

I welcome this directive as the first-ever EU law introducing Europe-wide rights for our 37 million disabled citizens, an end to the back-door route to legislate for disability rights and a tribute to the disability movement which has campaigned for this day. In particular the agreement of the principle of reasonable accommodation, pioneered in Sweden and Ireland, will now ensure that employers across Europe adapt their workplaces, acquire specialist equipment and amend their working practices so that disabled employees really do get a fair chance. It might simply mean lowering a light switch by a metre but, for the wheelchair user it makes the difference between a job or no job.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Mann for his support on this point. I also thank my colleague, Mr Cashman, for accepting my amendments on the action programme which will guarantee European money to cover the extra cost of disability, to promise information accessible to all, and to ensure that disabled people can speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Two more messages. Firstly, to all MEPs, remember that we achieved a strong directive combating race discrimination, for which I was proud to act as co-rapporteur, with action against incitement, for the right to go to court, to empower NGOs, to shift the burden of proof. Do not meddle with these hard-won gains.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to the Commissioner, I know you will not today be able to accept my Amendment No 56 on procurement, but in your reply I ask you to promise this House that you will bring forward new legislation to link the power of the public purse to companies' compliance with these laws. Please also tell us that it was a mistake for the Commission to propose core funding for only one European NGO representing each discriminated group. This legislation is about valuing diversity. Do not ignore your own words by denying deaf people, people with learning difficulties, and self-managed organisations of disabled people the possibility even to sit at the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I would like to say that this fight is not the exclusive property of the left. Sometimes, with cheap demagoguery and a progressivism which it cannot even define, the left tries to confuse the public with hypotheses which sometimes lack any content and are sometimes inadequate for the task of structuring society in accordance with certain values which our Group will always champion. That is what differentiates some benches from others.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 13 is the starting point for a new EU objective: to combat discrimination or inequality in the treatment of citizens for the reasons listed therein.</p>
<p class="contents">The action programme seems to me to be a serious programme. It is almost acceptable in its original form because, essentially, it is directed at something fundamental, that is, educating European society in the value of the human being, of whatever type. I believe that this is the central nucleus of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider that it is necessary to commit the public and private sectors to this task and, to this end, I believe that the public sector must provide an example. Public administrations and schools must be a model in the fight against discrimination and the same must be required, naturally to an equal extent, of the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task. Unfortunately today, certain sections of the media, such as television and the Internet, do not contribute through their programmes and advertisements to the dignified and respectful treatment of the sectors of society who most need that cooperation, such as, for example, women and children. The objective of also increasing the awareness of the media with regard to this task therefore seems to me to be a very good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incredibly important that we should now secure implementation of the package which is the first and interim realisation of Article 13 of the EC Treaty. In that way, we should be taking an important step towards removing discrimination against minorities in the EU and the applicant countries. I should therefore like to emphasise two important points. First of all, I believe that, if the initiatives for combating discrimination that we are now putting in place are to succeed in practice and on a day-to-day basis, it is crucial that the NGOs which represent the minorities affected should be involved as much as possible in the work. Otherwise, the initiatives will not succeed in the real world.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to point out is that, with this first package, the Commission has unfortunately committed a serious error by itself putting reasons for discrimination in order of priority. Only racial discrimination is to be prohibited in all areas of society in general. Discrimination for other reasons, for example because of handicap or sexual orientation, is only prohibited when it comes to employment and occupation. Grounds for discrimination should have equal status. Discrimination is equally offensive, whether it occurs on the basis of race or sexual orientation. I therefore wish strongly to support Mrs Swiebel’s proposal to the effect that the Commission be obliged to correct this error within the next three years. I can see that the Commissioner is here today. Today is therefore a good opportunity to confirm that this proposal will be followed up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This fight against discrimination is a fight that mobilises us all and it cannot be an exclusive banner for any political group in this Parliament. Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam threw up a challenge for the European Union agenda, which gave the Community specific powers to initiate a variety of actions to combat discrimination, so as to ensure the same level of protection for all disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the Commission on the important step it has taken in initiating this process of implementing Article 13 through the package of proposals that it has presented to combat discrimination. Experience has also shown us that the promotion of anti-discrimination legislation is essential but it is not enough. Such measures must be accompanied by preventive work and efforts to change behaviour and attitudes. Clear proof of this comes from the results of a fairly recent Eurobarometer survey, which showed that one in three Europeans, roughly 33%, regarded themselves as very or fairly racist. It is crucial that we teach and promote respect for multicultural diversity in Europe. I should also like to stress the importance of involving the countries applying for membership as much as we can in these Community actions to combat discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given the large number of discriminatory actions, decisions and attitudes which still appear today in Europe, I am pleased with these reports which we are debating today and which contain certain points which I feel to be particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must insist on the need to bear in mind, when implementing the concrete actions of this programme, Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is the pivotal instrument in the fight against discrimination in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must highlight the particular discrimination suffered by certain social groups, women, the disabled, immigrants, homosexual men and women, the elderly and ethnic minorities and, within these groups, we must insist on the importance of monitoring and implementing concrete measures in the fight against cases of multiple or double discrimination, which occur especially in the case of women.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to stress the need to integrate the gender element into all areas of the fight against discrimination and, in parallel, I wish to ask the Commission to make a clear and decisive effort to achieve coherence between the directives, recommendations and programmes against discrimination, giving this House a leading role in the establishment of priorities, the carrying out of an assessment of the effectiveness of the actions proposed today in this programme and the revision, if necessary, of the actions and decisions taken within this action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the European Parliament must be kept informed, taking account of the reports and opinions produced by this House, and we must highlight the importance and necessity of truly making use of the opinion and participation of the NGOs and associations – and providing them with the necessary resources – since they are without doubt the key to the success of the measures adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen the tragic results in Northern Ireland and in the Balkans. It simmers away under the surface in several parts of our European Union. Nevertheless the spiritual dimension is a vital dimension of our European way of life. It is a clear fact of our European history that we have a large number of religions and each of those religions has various and diverse churches, denominations and trends. It is important that they should be able to uphold their beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the rather obvious fact that priests and ministers can be restricted to the relevant faith without promoting accusations of illegal discrimination. But that is not enough. We must support Amendment No 37 by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which also exempts any restrictions on the religion or faith of persons who come directly into contact with members of that faith in education, social welfare or health care, for example, teachers in denominational schools, doctors and nurses in hospitals and hospices, visitors to inmates in prison, counsellors and carers for children, old people, teenagers and married couples, where these socially desirable services are provided by religious bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">A spiritual dimension is vital to Europe. We must avoid absurd tangles of red tape, which will only succeed in reducing Europe to a purely materialistic, politically correct but pointless entity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was, moreover, the basis for proposed measures to combat discrimination. These proposals involve two draft directives and one action programme intended to support the efforts of the Member States. It is extremely difficult, of course, both for me and for my fellow Members, to give a precise opinion on measures of such great significance in just two minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Mann report on equal treatment in employment, and let me congratulate the rapporteur, I shall confine myself to pointing out that I am, personally, satisfied that it has been possible to reduce the number of permissible exemptions to a minimum. Some possibilities have been retained, however, which I must admit I find somewhat shocking. One such is the possibility of derogation on terms of religion. The provision according to which the notion of professional, essential and crucial requirement may justify exemptions on the grounds of religion is not, in my view, acceptable. As a confirmed secularist, I could not possibly endorse it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same vein, the exemptions authorised on the basis of age must be treated with the utmost vigilance since, in practical terms, that often leads to the exclusion of the oldest employees.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject, now, of the programme to combat discrimination, the Commission’s proposals are satisfactory. Some aspects needed clarifying, and now they have been. I congratulate the rapporteur on this and, in conclusion, I shall vote in favour of these reports, with the exception of the point I raised just now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It lies at the very heart of everything we believe in in the European Union. I subscribe to the objective of the present proposal of extending this right to include the professional environment. I am aware that there are also arguments in favour of guaranteeing European legislation for equal treatment within one market. But beyond that, I am beginning to find myself at odds with the rest of the opinions in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Parliament has overdone it when it comes to the rather restrained legislation which the European Commission would have wanted to submit. Surely this proposal has been drafted with the intention of applying it within an economic sphere of business and trade? It is simply not practical if you run a small business, and someone discovers after twelve months that he was discriminated against in a selection procedure which involved forty candidates, to keep each and every file from that period and then investigate exactly what happened during that selection procedure once more. They might not even remember the candidate involved. Surely this is not acceptable. Why do we in Parliament never think about the practical implications of the legislation we draft? I hope something can as yet be salvaged in the process with the Council and Commission which is to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make a request to the Commissioner. Commissioner, the inquiry has been followed up by a <span class="italic">fiche d'impact</span>. In my view, this <span class="italic">fiche d'impact</span> – and I am involved a great deal with small and medium-sized businesses in this Parliament – is one big scandal. It amounts to one official having spent one afternoon behind a desk dreaming up all kinds of positive effects which in no way tally with reality. I call for a real <span class="italic">fiche d'impact</span>: an actual enquiry into the consequences for small and medium-sized businesses of this directive as it has been laid down by this Parliament, and not a would-be story made up by some official who has never set foot in a business, and I would welcome this before this directive becomes legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a task of major importance, the positive effects of which will be felt directly or indirectly, sooner or later, in the life of the Member States in the form of concrete programmes and measures or even amendments to legislation. These have been demanded by changes in our societies, and governments have often not been able to respond to them satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="contents">The civilisation we share asserts its greatness through respect for the rules of an open, tolerant and liberal society, with its inclusive and multicultural dynamics. Yet even today the generous idea of granting each citizen the greatest possible freedom, provided it is compatible with the same measure of freedom for others, still comes up against obstacles – some <span class="italic">de facto</span>, others <span class="italic">de jure</span>. In the face of dogmatism, prejudice and ignorance, which even today condemn so many of our fellow citizens to sub-citizen status, Europe draws on its best qualities: our tradition of enlightenment and emancipation for individuals and groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The family, for instance, remains a foundation and a pillar of our society. But how many of the Member States of the Union still embrace in their legislation static and dogmatic concepts of the family, discriminating against unmarried partnerships and, in a particularly shocking and anachronistic manner, against those partnerships composed of homosexual couples? The family should be seen today, ultimately, as a community based on affection rather than the civil effect of a contract blessed by religion. The fight against discrimination that we are discussing today means above all the affirmation of inclusive citizenship, more demanding than the exclusive citizenship of the past, historically linked to the origins of democracy and the republic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We did this first with the proposal concerning discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin, and now we are moving on to the action plan and discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their quite excellent reports. I want to pause and consider a special group, namely the disabled. I have taken an interest in this issue since I was a member of the Swedish Parliament and we carried out a major investigation which resulted in a proposal to combat discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">We then looked at unemployment, which at that period was generally very low in Sweden, and compared it with unemployment specifically among the disabled. At that time, we had an overall unemployment figure of 2 per cent among the population as a whole. Among the most severely disabled, unemployment stood at 70 per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still the case that the most severely disabled barely figure in the labour market. They <span class="italic">are</span> discriminated against at the present time. This type of legislation is therefore needed, and often it is only minor measures that are required. We often talk about the internal market and young people’s opportunities to study and work throughout Europe. But what is the situation for young people who are disabled? What opportunity do they have to work in the internal market, to study in different countries and to pursue their personal development? We are at present discriminating in this area. It is therefore important that we tackle this discrimination. This should be done in relation to a number of areas. The disabled are also discriminated against when it comes to gaining access to restaurants and cultural institutions. The matter must therefore be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point. The disabled are incredibly important when it comes to organisations. Because organisations are important in this process, I hope that the amendment which I tabled, to the effect that more than one organisation should have a share of the grants, and which was adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will also be that amendment which is finally adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the directives has already been adopted in record time, and I am quite optimistic that the other one will be adopted during the French Presidency in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate in Parliament was extremely interesting, and you have already highlighted the political importance of this directive. In terms of social solidarity, human rights and social justice, and in terms of the internal market, it is very important to understand that we must have the same minimum social standards in all Member States and in the applicant countries in the future as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mr Mann, for the excellent work they have done. I would also like to thank the committees involved for their support and cooperation in getting a coordinated view in such a short time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the Community action programme is adopted by the Council this autumn so that we can avoid a gap between it and the preparatory actions which we are currently running. I can accept a number of your proposals. In particular I welcome the amendments you have made on mainstreaming and on the issue of multiple discrimination. I will also accept the amendments you have tabled to bring out the importance of preventing discrimination, as well as combating it. Prevention is the key to a long-term strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the emphasis you have placed on doing what we can to meet the special needs of people who have difficulties in participating in the programme. This will necessarily include efforts to make all the documentation around the programme as simple and as accessible as possible (on which you have also proposed amendments). I am aware of the difficulties and of the complication of the forms of these projects and I will try to simplify them.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also agree to highlight in future the importance of NGOs, both as partners and as target actors participating in the actions themselves. It will be important to involve as wide a range of types and sizes of NGOs as possible to make sure that we benefit from the experience of these people who work every day with these issues. I can accept your proposals to write into the body of the decision the limit of 90% for the co-funding of such NGOs, and we can justify this proposal because there are many particularities in these NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, therefore, I can accept either as drafted or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 18, 21, 41 to 45, 47, 50, 58, 59, 62, 64, 65, 66 and 67. I can also accept parts of Amendments Nos 3, 14, 16, 31, 33, 35, 38, 40, 55 and 57. I am unable to accept the remaining amendments for a variety of reasons. Some are not in conformity with other legal requirements, for example the amendment concerning the committees' arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Some are simply not compatible with the Commission's objective, such as focusing the annual report on the implementation of the programme rather than on a particular aspect of the fight against discrimination itself. Others risk creating an imbalance in programmes by an over-concentration on a particular aspect; others again are not necessary to achieve Parliament's objective, as the ideas are either implicitly or explicitly already included in the decision, such as those on drawing on the experience of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Mann's report, I would like to comment on the main amendments tabled before Parliament today. There are three categories of amendment. The first one concerns disability, religion and age. The second category aims to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third category consists of a large number of amendments which try to bring this proposal in line with the directive on racial discrimination adopted last June. As far as the first category is concerned, disability, religion and age, the specific problems facing disabled people are acknowledged in the current draft where the provision to reasonably accommodate the workplace to the needs of disabled people is specifically foreseen. This is a key provision for achieving equal treatment for people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome your clarification on the terms "reasonable accommodation": you use the word "adjustment" and "undue hardship". Your proposal is very useful, as discussions in the different institutions have shown that these terms were not fully understood. Now it has become clear that a number of factors such as the cost involved, the financial resources of the organisations and the possibility of obtaining public funds will determine if their accommodation would impose a considerable burden on the employer. I would like to clarify that the valuation of the economic impact in SMEs is not just the work or job of a civil servant. We use as a basis the statistics at European and national level, we use surveys and we have comparisons with the impact in the USA where there are surveys and results after a long period of implementation of directives like this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key issue concerns religious organisations and the possibility of using the genuine occupation requirement clause in Article 4(2). However, this provision should not give rise to discrimination on the sole grounds of disability, age or sexual orientation and we must be very clear on that. I welcome your reference to this question in Amendment No 37.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also agree to the idea of extending the wording of Article 4(2) to include organisations providing services in a religious environment, as we realise that the wording of the Commission's proposal was very rigid. In my view, with these two additions, the scope of the proposal becomes clear.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, I cannot accept Amendment No 38 which proposes to delete from Article 5 the list of differences of treatment on grounds of age, which could be justified. This is not in line with our proposal. The Commission's intention is to create workable rules for companies while at the same time prohibiting instances of discrimination which are arbitrary and not objectively justified. However, I understand that this is a very sensitive issue. The Commission is ready to simplify the wording of Article 5 for better understanding of this provision.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the second category of amendments, it aims to clarify the text of the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose the removal of the reference to discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin. All three can be accepted for reasons of legal consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">I also accept the references to the 2000 employment strategy, to personal and self-realisation, to discrimination as an obstacle to free movement of persons, to the clarification of the personal scope of the directive as being applicable to third country nationals, to the clarification of the burden of proof and to the simplification of the information provision. These references are contained in Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9, 12, 34 and 47. The Commission can accept the spirit of all these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to turn now to the third category of amendments. I can accept the spirit behind all these amendments but in some cases there is a problem with the wording. However, there are a number of other amendments which I cannot accept, either for technical reasons or because their detailed nature runs counter to the purpose of the Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer in detail to those amendments which I cannot accept because they present political or legal difficulties. You have addressed the important question of contract compliance. This kind of provision is not appropriate in a directive on a framework proposal. I agree that it is very important and I pledge that it will be a communication: we will examine this in the text of the communication we have already announced in the social agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have raised the issue of monitoring and statistics. We all know that this is very important, but I must stress that in some Member States the collection of this kind of data infringes constitutional provisions on the protection of privacy. So I cannot accept your proposal on Amendment No 43, but I agree with you that, without monitoring, it becomes extremely difficult to know what progress is being made and the action programme will explore what can be done at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept your references in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and non-formalised groups of persons, as this employment proposal only applies to individuals. It is clearly a legal problem.</p>
<p class="contents">You propose in Amendment No 52, by analogy with the directive on racial discrimination, to incorporate a provision on independent bodies to monitor compliance with the provision of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have difficulties with Amendments Nos 19 and 35, in which you propose a time-frame of three years in order to equalise the scope of the discrimination legislation for all the grounds referred to in Article 3. It is impossible to refer to this time-frame in a directive, but the implementation of the action plan will help us to see how we can move forward with the other amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I can accept, either as drafted or in spirit, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 23, 24, 26, 30, 34, 40, 49, 50, 51 and 54 and also parts of Amendments Nos 7, 9, 13, 20, 25, 29, 36, 37, 41, 42, 46, 47, 48, 58, 59, 60 and 61. This very large number of accepted amendments proves the excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, some Members of Parliament referred to the need for cooperation about, or the implementation of, directives like these in the applicant countries. This directive must be part of the social <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the applicant countries. It is the first time that we allow joint projects in this action programme. Applicant countries can cooperate with the Member States and submit joint projects and joint proposals and this is very important for them and for us also. Some of the Members have referred to the particular problems that Turkey has with the Kurdish language and the problems in Turkey. I consider that the Community could support and select any kind of project that the Turkish Government submitted in the framework of this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I had to reply to more than 50 different points and amendments and I am very optimistic that these amendments will be adopted during the French presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
