<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Rossa (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, obviously it will not be possible in five minutes to do justice to the issue. I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in Parliament for the opportunity to have this debate. It is important that a petition signed by 1.9 million citizens of Europe should be given a hearing in this House. For a while that looked unlikely, so I thank everybody who worked so hard to ensure that it did. I want to thank in particular Mr Corrie, the rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, who also helped to prepare this report, because this was an enhanced cooperation report shared by the Committee on Petitions and the Development Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to make clear that this report does not deal with hunting in Europe. Therefore the three amendments tabled are not necessary and I would ask colleagues not to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">'Bushmeat' or 'wild meat' describes the food product of wild animals, whether consumed locally or traded commercially. Although the overuse of bushmeat is a fast-growing problem everywhere, this report concentrates on Africa because the bushmeat problem there is the most significant and best-described in the literature.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the illegal trade in the meat of wild animals is not limited to Africa. In Asia many species are unsustainably exploited, either to provide food for the pet trade or because people believe that eating specific animal parts can cure disease or strengthen their sexual capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">The trade in wildlife in South America is also growing and wild animals such as monkeys, birds, capybara and other large rodents, as well as tapirs, armadillos and deer, are for sale.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle any wild animal can be used to provide a market with bushmeat. In Africa more than 50 species are for sale in markets and restaurants, including antelopes, monkeys, apes, pangolins, pigs, large rodents, elephants, reptiles – such as snakes, lizards and crocodiles, invertebrates – such as snails and insects, and birds such as hornbills. However, the bulk of the trade is made up of mammals, usually weighing more than one kilogram.</p>
<p class="contents">Current estimates show that bushmeat is being consumed on a massive scale across the humid tropics, particularly in Africa. The most recent estimates of the annual wild meat harvest are 23 500 tonnes in Sarawak, 67 000 to 164 000 tonnes in the Brazilian Amazon and between one million and five million tonnes – off the bone – in the Congo Basin.</p>
<p class="contents">This results in overexploitation. In Africa, in 2000, at least one species of red colobus monkey probably became extinct due to hunting, and many other species are expected to follow shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Livelihoods and biodiversity suffer as a result of overexploitation of wildlife for food. Of the estimated 1.2 billion people who live on less than the equivalent of one euro a day, about 250 million live in agriculturally marginal areas, and a further 350 million live in or near forests, of whom an estimated 60 million are indigenous people living in forests. A recent study by the UK Department for International Development has estimated that 150 million people – one-eighth of the world’s poorest – regard wildlife as an important livelihood asset. Therefore it is clearly not an easy problem to get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">Human population growth, poverty, bad governance, and the commercialisation of consumption and distribution of poached animals are the underlying causes of the bushmeat problem. Natural resources cannot replenish themselves in the face of growing demand. Small stable rural communities could subsist on the natural resources in their environment without depleting them. However, the human population explosion, combined with an expanding urban – and world – market system, has changed this. The exploitation of natural resources has become unsustainable, with the developed industrialised nations dominating the acquisition of resources. Poverty inevitably outweighs concerns about conservation and makes enforcement measures seem unjustified and hard to implement where people depend on bushmeat to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the underlying causes of the unsustainable bushmeat trade also cause poverty: weak local governance and unfavourable terms of trade. It is therefore important that the conservation and development communities should work together with indigenous populations and civil society on this shared agenda in order to address the underlying causes of poverty and biodiversity loss.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listed about 20 issues which the Commission should address. Resources are obviously required. We have avoided putting a figure on those resources, but the Commission should commit a specific amount of resources to ensure that this matter is dealt with effectively and that it is possible to work with the relevant organisations and with the people on the ground who either depend on bushmeat for income or for protein to survive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, addressing the bushmeat crisis is of the utmost importance. As you know only too well, poaching and unsustainable levels of hunting threaten the existence of some of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom: the gorilla species, chimpanzees and other types of apes.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter is clearly of concern to the general public, as nearly two million signatures to the petition suggest. It is also a matter of great concern to the Commission, in line with the global commitment to stop biodiversity loss by 2010. We therefore welcome the report from Mr De Rossa, which I find balanced and to the point.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working to address the issue in a number of different ways, but I must first emphasise the need to distinguish clearly between the bushmeat crisis – which threatens certain species of animals – and the everyday consumption of wild meat, which forms an essential part of food security for poor people in the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that there are several aspects related to bushmeat which go beyond the development agenda; these include health issues in Europe, some trade issues as well as scientific issues. But since most over-exploitation of bushmeat takes place in developing countries, the best solution is to provide support for these countries through our development cooperation efforts and address the bushmeat crisis at its origin.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis can be taken up in the context of natural resources, rural development or governance issues, or as a cross-cutting issue to be addressed <span class="italic">inter alia</span> through Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Assessments. These assessments should identify risks and possible mitigation measures with respect to bushmeat for all development activities. In this respect, I am happy to inform you that the manual for ‘Integrating environment concerns into development and economic cooperation’ will be finalised and made operational during the first half of this year. The revised manual should go a long way to ensuring that proper attention is given to bushmeat issues in environmental assessments and therefore in all our relevant development activities. The mid-term reviews of our cooperation strategies this year will be used to strengthen the integration of environmental concerns, in particular through promoting a more systematic use of Country Environmental Profiles, Strategic Environmental Assessments and as previously mentioned, Environmental Impact Assessments. All this is fine; it may not constitute a very direct reaction but nonetheless provides the background necessary for proper consideration of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">National ownership is very important. In fact, activities aimed at curbing over-exploitation of bushmeat mean <span class="italic">nothing</span> if the bushmeat countries themselves do not take the lead. We can help with appropriate support-building capacity and with injecting the views expressed when we are revising country strategies, but the ownership of the problem is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add a special point which is that peace is essential. If we look at the conflict in the DRC and in other countries in the region over the past 10 years, the reality is that these conflicts have been blocking any attempt to create even a minimum of governance in relation to the problem we are discussing. Soldiers and internally displaced people, refugees, have had no restriction, no incentive, no guidance, no punishment, no governance whatsoever on how to behave in this regard. It has been an area outside law and order and we have seen the terrible consequences. I would make this number one on the list of priorities and, in fact, I regard a peace dividend for the environment and for the bushmeat crisis as one of the many important aspects for securing peace in the DRC and elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not convinced that a specific action plan would be the best way to address the bushmeat crisis, and this reflects what I said about ownership. Both the EC strategy for integrating environmental into economic and development cooperation and the Biodiversity Action Plan for development cooperation are being reviewed this year. It is preferable to ensure that bushmeat issues are properly addressed in these two strategies, rather than to put together a specific bushmeat strategy which would require a lot of resources in terms of staffing but may not necessarily lead to additional action to address the problem. Considering the multi-sectoral implications of the bushmeat issue, such an approach would not be the best one.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Community projects in East, South and West Africa take on this challenge in very practical terms. Although spending on the environment as a percentage of the total aid programme is quite low, we have invested considerably in environmental protection and management in key countries. For example, in Central Africa since 1992 the Commission has invested approximately EUR 67 million in the Ecofac programme for Central African forest ecosystems, which pilots innovative, protected-area management in crucial Great Ape habitats. The Commission is also funding work to control hunting and poaching in private forest concessions, and promoting eco-tourism in the region as part of its responsible management of the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are working at political level to address the bushmeat crisis. For example, we recently provided a EUR 500 000 grant to help launch the Africa Ministerial Process for Forest Law Enforcement and Governance. Although the primary objective of this process is to improve forest-sector governance and combat illegal logging, the inclusion of several important references to bushmeat and wildlife in the conference declaration will help to raise the profile of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcome the initiative of presenting this broad-based engagement on the part of the public to Parliament. This, in my view, is a very constructive way of giving this issue the attention it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his excellent report and the way in which he presented it today.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, can the Commissioner confirm that the action plan only covers tropical areas, and in particular the continent of Africa, and does not in any way impinge on hunting in the European Union, as some people are interpreting it?</p>
<p class="contents">Sensible action is vital and urgent for three reasons. Firstly, as Mr De Rossa has said, at least 150 million of the world's poorest people regard wildlife as a vital livelihood asset. Commercial hunting, the exploitation of timber and the opening-up of the forests are destroying the ecological balance and depriving local inhabitants of their food and livelihood.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the totally indiscriminate killing of great ape species will wipe out gorillas and chimpanzees, which in countries such as Rwanda are a major sustainable tourist attraction and source of income that will be lost forever. The devastation of forests will also obliterate an ecology if logging is not urgently brought under control.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third even more important point. The illegal exporting of bushmeat to all corners of the globe could have a devastating effect on health that would make SARS look like the common cold. Many gorillas and chimpanzees carry SIV, the animal equivalent of HIV, which can jump to humans – and has done so. That would be bad enough, but if ebola-infected meat reaches the world market, we could see a catastrophe far worse than HIV. Recently, 2 000 monkey noses were found in a suitcase at Amsterdam airport, showing that the illegal trade is thriving.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution urges the Commission to adopt a series of measures, which I hope it will. However, making Heads of State in bushmeat countries aware of the situation and getting them, as the Commissioner has said, to take the lead in action to safeguard ecosystems and the wildlife they support would be a major step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the issues we need to address is the definition of bushmeat. It is insufficiently precise. We know or believe that we are all talking about the same thing: primarily, endangered species, in particular the great apes. There is, however, a delicacy trade, which is for the consumption of bushmeat outside Africa. It is clearly enormously difficult, both in Africa and in South America, to prevent people who are starving or who have extremely limited amounts of food from 'poaching' in their neighbouring jungle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are species both in South America and in Africa that can be managed and could form the basis of an organised trade, with the appropriate safeguards. My concern is that there is a large market in Europe for bushmeat. Every year several thousands of pounds in weight of illegally-imported bushmeat is seized at London Heathrow airport alone, most of it in an appalling condition. There is a reasonably large number of residents and citizens from the European Union, and from African and South American countries who, perhaps legitimately, want to consume this if it can be provided on a sustainable basis. This demand will not go away any more than the demand of Mr De Rossa's Irish compatriots for Guinness will go away, wherever they are based. The risk is that we will drive it underground even further than has been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the options that the Commission needs to look at most earnestly is the proper management of the trade, which would involve extensive and, unfortunately, expensive, surveys of animal populations, control of selective killing and, as far as the export trade is concerned, proper regulation for public health. As Mr Corrie said, driven underground, the implications of this trade for public health are appalling. It is a scandal that, in the interests of land management, American multi-millionaires can shoot elephants that need to be culled, whilst people of African origin are not allowed to buy and consume bushmeat in a managed trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr De Rossa for his assurance that this report does not and cannot refer to deer and elk management in Europe. I would also point out that any references to high-powered rifles are unnecessary. There are approximately 20 million AK-47s in Africa, and any control we have over rifles in the European Union will make no difference. However, like other colleagues, I urge the Commission to take action soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report, as we have been told, arose from a petition signed by 1.9 million people EU-wide, which led the Committee on Petitions to produce its report. This was not, may I say, without resistance from certain political groups in this House. The Christian Democrats, many of whose press releases extolling the virtues of the De Rossa Report are today littering the press centre in Strasbourg, initially voted against the report being prepared. We in the animal welfare and conservation movements welcome the late conversion of British Conservatives to the side of animal welfare in this regard. The same is true of the Green and Liberal Groups who to begin with also voted against the report being prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of public health, public safety and the protection of endangered species, we will be supporting the demands for the EU to use both carrot and stick to encourage conservation of these endangered species in their indigenous habitats, to enable local communities to find alternative food sources and to prevent the illegal importation of bushmeat into the EU. Mr Corrie's mention of the recent seizure in Amsterdam of 2 000 monkey noses indicates all too well the extent of the trade and the suffering and devastation occasioned to these animals.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not be supporting any of the three amendments, which we believe are misconceived and – deliberately or not – mischievous. Mr De Rossa's report is concerned with the illegal hunting of endangered species and in no way poses a threat to hunting in the European Union, as the EDD Group amendment claims. Apart from Gibraltar, where safeguarding the apes might be a welcome way of deflecting a Spanish threat, Europe has no great apes. Equally, the ELDR Group amendment is a contradiction in terms: there is no such thing as a sustainable level of hunting for critically endangered species. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to highlight a couple of issues, one being the role of logging companies. There are proposals within the report as to how we could help them to face up to their responsibilities, given that, at times, they use bushmeat as an apparently cheap and readily available food source for their workers and their vehicles are used to carry poached meat. The proposal is to incorporate this into the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade process, which I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the issue of importing into the European Union and the highly questionable and grim circumstances surrounding it has already been raised. We could do more at this end, in terms of educating consumers and suppliers in the Union, to help them realise what the effect of their actions is on the ecology and development in the countries of origin and to stop people from regarding bushmeat as a luxury delicacy, whereas what we are really looking at is the potential extinction of animals in certain places. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the great apes are already protected by the Washington Convention and cannot therefore be hunted, they should nonetheless be monitored more closely to prevent poaching, following the example of the ABAC programme (Alternatives to Poaching in Central Africa). But, as the rapporteur explains, hunting is not the only reason why these species are dying out, far from it. The massive, mechanised deforestation of equatorial Africa and the population explosion across the continent as a whole are key factors in the destruction of the Great Apes’ habitat, without forgetting the unprecedented devastation caused by the Ebola virus in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that we need to redefine the notion of the bushmeat crisis, so that it stands for more than just excessive removal of animals from the wild. There are many different underlying causes for the disappearance of these species.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of wild meat is not acceptable either as it stands, in my opinion, because it introduces confusion as to the origin of game. I think that in a legislative text – to respond to Mr Ford – any clarification is always useful and I think that in all cases it is extremely important to define the scope very strictly.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, which concerns tropical and equatorial areas, we should confine ourselves to the term ‘bushmeat’. The generic term ‘wild meat’ is much too vague. It also encompasses the species of game that are present in the Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret that Mr Ford wants to make this a political matter, because I believe this is something on which all political parties could work together for the greater good in order to stop this horrible trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As we meet here in Strasbourg, great apes, gorillas, chimpanzees and monkeys are all being hunted to extinction for <span class="italic">commercial</span> bushmeat. At the current rate, people are paying a premium to eat more great apes each year than are now kept in all the zoos and laboratories of the world. The shocking statistic is that if the slaughter continues at its current pace, the remaining wild apes in Africa will be gone within the next 15 to 50 years – a long time, but it will soon go if we do not stop this trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I pay tribute to Dr Brian Carroll of Bristol Zoo, in my own region, who has worked with zoos across the UK to collect a stunning half a million signatures as part of the Europe-wide campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a catastrophe that affects both the survival of our closest relatives and the people who rely on forests for their livelihoods. The biggest challenge now facing conservationists is to reduce the demand for bushmeat. It is essential that we maintain an education programme that will keep people from buying and eating great apes through greater understanding and awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can do more here in Europe. I am horrified by the scale of this sickening trade every year. Tonnes of bushmeat are confiscated at Europe's airports. We must have stricter controls at all EU ports and airports to stop such meat getting into Europe – witness, colleagues, the devastation caused by foot-and-mouth outbreaks across Europe. We had our own inquiry. Foot-and-mouth is prevalent in parts of western Africa. Smuggled bushmeat could not only spark a new outbreak in Europe, it could also expose our livestock to diseases and epidemics on the African continent. Every kilogram of smuggled meat in the EU food chain poses a real threat not only of animal diseases, but also human ones, such as Ebola.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, your support for the conclusions of this temporary committee into the outbreak, and its demand for tougher measures to prevent diseases entering the EU was overwhelming, yet in my own country we have only six sniffer dogs to seek out this hideous trade. We are not taking this threat seriously enough and all Member States could do more. Endangered wildlife and habitats are a precious and irreplaceable asset. We must stop this barbaric trade before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Analysis of these activities demands a better understanding of the contribution which, as the Commissioner said, conflict and weak governance in particular make to this problem, and we in the European Union, as donors, should perhaps be more serious about supporting conservation and biodiversity projects. Running alongside this, the efforts we make on conflict prevention and the peace facility proposed for the African Union, etc. will play their part in addressing some of the concerns raised here today. This is an issue which has been regularly debated in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and which has consistently received the support of our ACP parliamentary colleagues. They tell us, and we have had discussions with them, about the importance – also emphasised by the Commissioner – their governments must attach to the priority of making sustainable management and conservation of natural resources a clear part of their national indicative programmes. That is something in which we have a role to play in the JPA, and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and elsewhere, because, unless governments make this a priority, I am afraid we are whistling in the wind.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be said that bushmeat provides a major source of protein. In some parts of Nigeria, up to 84% of protein is obtained from bushmeat, which plays a significant part in people's lives. Where access to wildlife is restricted, people will have to adapt and continue to adapt in ways that entail even greater risks. It is much better to talk about controlling the trade than to suggest we stamp it out. If we talk about stamping out the illegal trade in bushmeat, all we will do is drive it underground and make it much more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of bushmeat in the livelihoods of poor people has never been assessed. We have made a lot of pronouncements this afternoon, but there has been no clear assessment of the importance of bushmeat in people's livelihoods.</p>
<p class="contents">I would end by saying that better management of the trade might contribute in no small way to our objective of meeting poverty eradication targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The illegal bushmeat trade is devastating endangered species and habitats in many developing countries. I welcome and endorse one recommendation in particular: to step up measures to detect and prevent illegal imports of bushmeat into Europe. Incredibly, smuggling illegal meat into Europe through ports and airports is still relatively easy despite the fact that this almost certainly caused the devastating foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2001, to which Mr Parish referred.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must set an example here and send a clear message to smugglers that any bushmeat they bring to ports of entry will be detected and they will be prosecuted. Regrettably, this violent, profitable trade continues unabated and thousands of tonnes of illegal bushmeat, from West Africa in particular, is slipping undetected into Europe each year, with organised gangs going unpunished. It must be said that the United States is showing us the way here: anyone who has recently travelled through a US airport will undoubtedly have been confronted by a hardworking beagle sniffing every piece of luggage for imported foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">I implore the European Commission to get tough with Member States.

I see that quite simply as being outside the scope of what one would normally expect this initiative to cover and fully agree with Mr De Rossa, Mr Corrie and others who have addressed this misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">We have enough real problems to cope with. The remarks made by Mrs Mathieu and others about hunting not being the only threat to these species are very important to bear in mind. There are two separate aspects: that of a deliberate threat, driven by greed, and that of a threat that is driven by people's need to survive. Both are equally dangerous for the species we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">In this discussion I see a parallel with the difficult issue of the need for Africans to change and move from a pastoral lifestyle, where they roam the countryside grazing their cattle, but in which there is an imbalance between the number of people and cattle and the square kilometres available. It is this pressure on land use, reflecting urbanisation and population growth, which many people do not expect to be a problem in a place as big as Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when one looks at the environmental constraints, such as access to water, Africa is not so big. The pressure on forests is one such systemic, ongoing and dramatic pressure which presents perhaps the greatest obstacle to establishing a sustainable alternative because the issue has to do with poverty and with real problems. We should mount a strong front to tackle the problem of criminal acts driven by greed. Trying to convince logging companies to act within the law and to adhere to regulations, and for this to be more widely recognised by governments, is part of the drive to create a minimum of decency in matters relating to forestry in African countries. This is quite clearly part of the action and our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are many aspects to the trade issue. One is quite simply our own legitimate defence of our health standards. We stopped imports of Nile perch from Lake Victoria for a number of years until we successfully managed – and this is one of my pet cases – to create an effective phytosanitary control. These exports are now up and running again and we have recreated thousands of jobs on a sustainable basis. I find it a little strange, however, that we have not done anything similar when it comes to bushmeat. What people have said in this debate is quite correct: ebola is one threat and there are many other very difficult aspects of this trade which require considerable attention. At the same time, many people depend for their survival on being able to hunt and eat bushmeat in their normal, traditional environment. We should respect that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had the debate about the brain drain. Maybe we can start discussing the protein drain, where the temptation to get our hands on exotic protein should be countered by focusing greater public attention on the issues involved. I would like to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
