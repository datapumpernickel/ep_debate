<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stavros Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Μember of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the extreme weather this summer has left a trail of destruction in numerous countries in Europe as well as in the United States of America and we have also seen many lives lost in the accidents of which the President spoke earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I too would therefore like, on behalf of the College of Commissioners, to express my condolences and our support for the victims of these disasters and accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iberian peninsular suffered the worst drought in 60 years and this, in conjunction with high temperatures, encouraged the fires to spread in southern Europe. At the same time as the fires, floods inundated Central and Eastern Europe and hurricane Katrina hit the southern states of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Floods and forest fires occur repeatedly in Europe. The repercussions were more serious this year, but the fact that they occurred comes as no surprise to us. Consequently, political leaders need to anticipate this sort of disaster by planning measures which help to prevent, where possible, and using all available resources to deal with such crises in the most efficient way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community civil protection mechanism was adopted in 2001 so that the European Union could respond in an efficient and coordinated manner to major emergencies. This mechanism is used to coordinate the resources available in the Member States for providing assistance. It also helps by conducting drills and planning hypothetical scenarios and simulations in order to identify possible gaps and problems in the Member States' civil protection systems and promotes cooperation and interoperability between the Member States' emergency services.</p>
<p class="contents">When the mechanism was activated in Portugal at the government's request, the European Union managed to organise the despatch and intervention of a number of fire-fighting vessels and helicopters from France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands within 24 hours to support the Portuguese fire-fighters and, with this assistance and more favourable weather conditions, it proved possible to check the fires within a few days.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the situation was brought under control and at midday today there were only five fires, compared with more than 50 on 22 August.</p>
<p class="contents">The mechanism was also used to provide help to Bulgaria and Romania, the two countries worst hit by the floods. Several Member States provided help by despatching teams, pumps, decontaminants and other resources through the European Union's civil protection mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the European Union is making an important contribution to and is participating in efforts by the United States to deal with the tragic trail of destruction left behind by hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Sunday, we received an official request for assistance from the United States and immediately activated the civil protection mechanism in order to coordinate the help provided by the Member States to the areas affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The European assistance package is made up of contributions from the Member States, which vary from material assistance to equipment and missions of experts and other specialists. Teams of experts and other materials have already arrived in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community civil protection mechanism has now become a necessary tool for coordinating European assistance. The response to the events of this summer, like the response to the tsunami at the end of last year, has proven that the mechanism operates satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there is room for improvement, which is why the Commission proposed a package of measures in April 2005 to strengthen the European Union's response capability in the field of civil protection. These measures include proposals to improve the transportation of aid and the facility for the European Union to lease specialist equipment, such as additional water bomber aircraft, from third countries. These are precisely the sort of measures which will give European citizens – and not just European citizens – better protection against future disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is now examining the package of measures to strengthen civil protection. I am certain that the European Parliament supports our proposals and will stand by us in our endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil protection can only cover the first, immediate stage of an emergency. Other resources need to be used in order to deal with the consequences of disasters and to prevent them; this is what Mr Pan Ouzký was talking about earlier. The Commission has certain such resources at its disposal. Let me give you some examples.</p>
<p class="contents">The rural development programmes provide support to a broad range of forestry activities with funds to prevent fires and restore forests which have suffered damage. The 'forest focus' regulation is the most recent resource which we have at our disposal for monitoring the application of measures to prevent forest fires. The financial package for 'forest focus' for the period from 2003 to 2006 totals EUR 65 million, which includes EUR 9 million for preventing fires.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as floods are concerned, the Commission has proposed that a European Union coordinated action plan be prepared and applied in order to manage the risk of floods. The Commission has taken the relevant political initiative in application of the conclusions of the European Council held in December 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union Solidarity Fund can provide support to countries hit by major disasters in order to help them with their restoration efforts. Romania and Bulgaria have already asked the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund. My colleagues responsible for regional policy, enlargement and agriculture are presently examining these requests.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, allow me to close by saying that I am certain that the European Parliament will support our proposals and will take advantage of this opportunity to put the commitment to solidarity which it has undertaken into further action. It is our duty towards everyone hit by the recent disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a demonstration of European diversity and of the need to be sensitive to the realities faced by others.</p>
<p class="contents">In several countries of the south of Europe, the fires have led to the loss of dozens of human lives, the evacuation of entire populations and extraordinary environmental damage. It is true that we are suffering a year of drought, but I believe that it is unacceptable to resign ourselves to fate. On the contrary, it is our responsibility to analyse the underlying causes of the disasters that are repeated year after year, and to find out what we are doing wrong or, quite simply, what we are failing to do. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore proposes the creation of a temporary committee in our Parliament. That committee should assess which concrete measures we could adopt in Europe to complement those that are being implemented in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Fire does not stop at national borders, and we should therefore create a European protocol for fighting fires; we should at least consider creating a specific European agency and – why not? – specialised cross-border bodies. Commissioner, twenty-four hours is sometimes too long. Without prejudice to the role of the European Solidarity Fund, I believe it would be a mistake to restrict ourselves to seeking funds every time we suffer a fire. We must go further: for example, the European Commission, with the support of the Council, has removed the aid to farmers for the creation, clearing and monitoring of firebreaks, and that is something that should perhaps be reconsidered.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are some of the proposals we could evaluate in this temporary committee that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposes be created in our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to express my solidarity with the victims of all of these disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to thank all of the Members of this Chamber, from north, south, east and west, and from all political groups, who have expressed specifically to us – the Portuguese socialists – their solidarity with the victims of the drought and the fires currently ravaging the western Iberian Peninsula, with Portugal very much the worst affected region.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that what is happening to Portuguese forests is, in terms of scale, without parallel around the world, without parallel in the Amazon region, without parallel anywhere. The deforestation that has taken place in recent decades is on an absolutely disastrous scale; we cannot ignore the scale of this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take account of the seriousness of the problem and consider the entire range of measures that need to be taken to deal with the situation. We must analyse the viability of the Solidarity Fund and ascertain why it has thus far been unable, for example, to combat the fires; why, for example, has it been unable to provide financial support for the aeroplanes needed to tackle the fires? We must look into the question of farming, as Mr Galeote Quecedo rightly pointed out, because this disaster is part of a drought on an enormous scale. We must also look into forest policy in order to ensure that it takes greater account of the climatic characteristics of the west of the Peninsula.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us begin, however, by asking ourselves why such events happen. In my view, global warming is certainly involved, as it has aggravated extreme events, or longer periods of drought, as was pointed out by Commissioner Dimas, whom I thank for being here today. I must also mention heavier rainfall – another phenomenon that has no counterpart in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that a two-degree increase in air temperature, from 20 to 22°C, means a 12% increase in the water vapour content of the atmosphere and hence in the amount of energy in the atmosphere, as we have unfortunately seen confirmed in hurricane Katrina. We have to pool our efforts to organise our civil defence response: that is truly a job to be tackled at Union level and no longer just by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strengthen our commitment to intervene following disasters, but above all, particularly as extreme events are getting worse, we must reinforce a global prevention plan that includes the maintenance of watercourses. It is clear that, when one addresses the situation on the ground, all the necessary measures need to be carried out on the ground. Such maintenance must allow for the hydroelectric use of watercourses, as well as reforestation and the recycling of biomass for energy purposes: in short, a measure designed to implement a systems-oriented plan of work.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the subject that I should like to put to you, and I have yet to hear any discussion of its importance. We must ensure that it can all be sustained with own resources so as to constitute a great resource for the European Union as a whole. It is a scheme that should enhance our security in terms of water resources, geology and fire protection and also enable us to make use of energy generated on the ground. It is a systems-oriented measure that I call on the European Union to promote in support of the actions taken by Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, as I see it, the images we have seen from the USA over recent days show that we politicians have the great responsibility of doing everything humanly possible to prevent such calamities or to alleviate their effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two or three practical questions I would like to put to Commissioner Dimas. The first has to do with protection against flooding. We heard, particularly from Austria, complaints to the effect that there was room for improvement in cross-border cooperation, for example on the Danube. Could you, Commissioner Dimas, say something more, and more specific, about what instruments the EU possesses to deal with this?</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the forest fires in Portugal, this is the second year that we have been faced with such an extreme situation. Last year, measures were introduced in the individual locations; do you have as yet any initial findings relating to them? Were these measures effective this year? If we are now to talk in terms of new funding, it follows that we have to know which measures are effective and which are not.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing I particularly want to do is to take up Mr Prodi’s idea. I am astonished, Commissioner Dimas, by the lack of any more proactive approach in your speech. Climatologists are predicting extreme drought in Southern Europe, as well as flooding and extreme weather phenomena in Central Europe, not to mention that climate change will make hurricanes and typhoons even more powerful and even more devastating. They have produced a whole range of publications on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask you, Commissioner Dimas, whether we ought not, at last, to do more about climate change, on top of all the many things that are said about it? Where have we got to with the second European Climate Change Programme, and how do you intend to inject more life into the climate talks in Montreal this autumn and winter?</p>
<p class="contents">If we decide on measures to protect us against climate change and organise them in an intelligent way, these self-same measures will reduce our dependence on crude oil and help to improve the quality of the air in our towns and cities. Perhaps the Commission should shed some light on the details of what would be a win-win-win situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some 200 000 hectares of forest in Portugal and over 120 000 hectares in Spain have thus far been scorched as a result of the severe drought. Dozens of human lives, including those of firefighters, have been lost; homes, farms and factories have been destroyed; protected ecosystems have been lost. That is without mentioning the heavy emotional cost, for which nothing, nobody, will compensate. We therefore wish to express our deepest condolences and our solidarity with the bereaved families and with the populations in the affected regions. We should also like to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by the firefighters and the people that have made efforts to combat the fires.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the seriousness of the situation, the Commission must quickly step up its collaboration with the national authorities to support the populations, to help minimise the effects of the fires and the flooding, to support all national support initiatives aimed at restoring the production capacities of the affected regions, thereby creating jobs and providing compensation for the social costs involved in job losses and destruction of livelihoods. This can be done by activating the Solidarity Fund for the regions and countries affected, if necessary by changing it. Community administrative procedures must be facilitated, especially those relating to the need to re-programme the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Measures must be taken to make these procedures more flexible. Support must be given for the reforestation of the affected areas – taking account of their bio-climatic and ecological characteristics – and for forest fire prevention measures, such as firebreaks, forest tracks, access points, water points and forestry programmes. Payment of certain direct aid to farmers under the common agricultural policy must be brought forward so as to take account of the problem of the fires and the drought on the farming sector. Article 87(2) of the Treaty must also be implemented as a matter of urgency, with the aim of granting appropriate financial aid to all affected sectors. A further urgently required measure is the implementation of an effective, Community-wide protection system, in order to protect farmers, especially small and medium-sized holdings, against dangers and crises such as those arising from the current drought and fires, or floods. Possible measures include a public farmers’ insurance scheme financed by Community funds, enabling farmers to receive a minimum wage in the event of public disasters of this nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should therefore like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, to address a few remarks directly to you. Quite apart from humanitarian and technical considerations, there is also a political dimension. The political question is whether or not the European institutions, and the Commission in particular, have the ability to give an unequivocal example of what European cooperation can be, of European solidarity for the many populations affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to tell you that the best thing that Europe can do at the present time for Portugal – the country that I know best – is to offer a swift and effective response to the populations affected, of which there are many throughout my country. A response a year from now, however technically good, technically perfect even, is worse than an immediate response that has political meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my message. I wish to express my hope that the Commission is able to translate these intentions into reality and that Parliament, in the guise of its temporary committee, applies the necessary pressure and offers the help needed for this to happen.</p>

<p class="contents">In its Resolution, the Socialist Group calls for European solidarity, not just through an immediate economic commitment, asking the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, but also through other medium- and long-term measures, such as the creation of a European civil protection body or a European drought monitoring centre, or also, ladies and gentlemen, through the production of an initiative report. We believe that this would be more effective than a temporary committee, and would seal the commitment that the European Parliament must also make, not just urging other institutions, such as the European Commission for example, to work, but also working itself as a legislator, in this case via its different committees, which could work together, as I have said, to produce an initiative report on forest fires and on the natural disasters that regularly desolate our continent in the summer.</p>

<p class="contents">These disasters are mistakenly described as natural disasters. In actual fact, we know that fires are nearly always, in the first place, caused by human beings, whether because they are criminal acts, because they are linked to acts of carelessness or because they are due to political choices that have led us to neglect entire areas. Faced with these disasters, we have to join together and let solidarity prevail. We require a genuine European public security organisation that combines human and material resources so that real European mutual aid can exist. Commissioner, you have made proposals along these lines. Faced with the scale of the disaster in Portugal, I was struck by the lack of resources on the ground. This would suggest that a precise list of everybody’s forces should be drawn up, and it is the responsibility of the Commission to take the initiative for this. We will support it in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to carry out repairs, and in order to do so, we must make use of the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund. We must, however, use these for prevention purposes. In this area, awareness campaigns encouraging vigilance and reminding arsonists of the penalties they incur must be implemented, or, as the case may be, strengthened. With regard to forestry policy and agricultural policy, let us acknowledge our mistakes, let us question the decisions that have led to lands being neglected and the spread of scrubland, where it is impossible for our public security forces to intervene effectively. We also need to make better use of plant species to combat fires.</p>
<p class="contents">The floods that have descended on Central Europe and Alpine Europe are not inevitable either. They are often due to the outcome of climate change and human activity. We are equipped with instruments and a raft of measures. We simply must call on the Member States to take on their share of the contract and to apply the national implementing measures without delay. The Commission must also present proposals to us for 2012. Without doubt, it is primarily human lives, those of our fire fighters and of our rescue teams, which for us are at stake, not to mention the ecological disaster and the need to regenerate the natural environment. It is with all of the direct or indirect victims in mind that we must intervene. In my constituency, in the Alps, we have had flooding, and in Provence and Corsica there have been fires. It is for this reason that European solidarity must operate as a survival reflex.</p>

When people are starting again from scratch for the third time in six years, as some are having to do in my part of the world, it is not surprising that there is a lot of despair in evidence. I believe that our definition of the Solidarity Fund is too narrow if it is not possible for Europe to intervene financially to deal with this, despite losses of the kind seen in the region from which I come, where one third of the provincial budget has – in the truest sense of the word – been washed away.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from reformulating the criteria for the Solidarity Fund, what can the EU do? Above all, I think, it can remind the Member States of their own responsibilities. As has already been said, climate change is already happening here. It has to be reiterated that Austria – and this I say as an Austrian – still has much to do when it comes to achieving the Kyoto target. You, Commissioner, cannot simply stand by and say that you will see to it that there are as many aircraft as possible in place in the event of a fire; we have to take action before things get that far.</p>
<p class="contents">In working across borders too – as we have seen from the floods, when different Member States were affected by the same adverse weather conditions – in the INTERREG programmes, and in research projects, priority needs to be given to cross-border measures and prevention. We have discussions on this subject to look forward to, and I see it as an area in which a rethink is called for. It is now open to us, in the next research framework programme and in the trans-European networks, to take appropriate medium-term action in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With many speakers, I can do no other than agree. We must of course prepare ourselves for the disasters that seem to come our way with ever-increasing frequency. I want to make it very clear, Commissioner Dimas, that the programmes that the Commission put forward resulted in preventive measures being taken. I can tell you that that was the case in my own home region, upon which the flooding has now had an appalling impact, and where the various measures we took to deal with flooding resulted in markedly less damage being done than in the past, even though the quantity of water was greater than when the area was last flooded. What that means is that aid is having an effect and is also being used to prepare preventive infrastructures. It is of course very regrettable that, in my electoral district and elsewhere, the flood occurred while these were being built, with the consequence that a number of things that were under construction were also destroyed and the floodwater took another course than it would have done had the infrastructure been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to appeal to the Commission to make extensive use of the Solidarity Fund. Funds for this purpose are still available for 2005. I hope that the Member States affected will soon be in a position to give Brussels a report on what the damage amounts to and enable the Commission to make funds promptly available for the speedy rebuilding of public facilities – for that is the major problem where I come from – and to help build up protective infrastructure. That will be the right response and will put us on the right track.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to talk to you about other fires – ones that burn and can be seen; fires that cause something very different from love, because they spread sadness, they confirm how impotent we are, they cause terror, they induce anguish, they kill, they destroy wealth and they undermine confidence in the present and hope for the future. This has manifested itself in a great sea of grey, and a giant cloak of smoke continues to lay waste to Portugal, especially the Central and Northern regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The forest fire disaster has thus far given us some terrible statistics; the fires have burnt more than 240 000 hectares! Yesterday, indeed, Motorway number 1, which links Lisbon and Oporto, was closed to traffic for hours, due to a fire burning near the town of Fátima. At the same time, flames continued to devastate the districts of Aveiro, Bragança, Guarda, Leiria, Santarém and Viseu.</p>
<p class="contents">In my district, Coimbra, which is the worst affected, the flames have consumed 32 km2 in the municipality of Pampilhosa da Serra alone, and only 8 km2 of forest remained. This municipality has been totally decimated and has virtually been wiped off the map.</p>
<p class="contents">In the city of Coimbra itself, the fire leapt over the River Mondego, penetrated well into the urban area and levelled everything in its path. The flames travelled 20 km in three hours. Some 80% of the Vale de Canas National Forest has been destroyed. Other municipalities in the region, such as Miranda do Corvo, where I am the chairman of the municipal assembly, Penela, Poiares, Penacova and Soure, have been hit in devastating fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">In some regions of the country, the picture is disastrous; the majority of the population has been affected and economic stability has been undermined (the forest is of key importance to the local and regional economy). There is no doubt that the situation meets the exceptional conditions that Commissioner Hübner has deemed acceptable for mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This summer, Spain, France and Greece have endured the same story, suffering similarly devastating effects. The fight against disasters must be made an EU priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to Portugal, in addition to the problem of the forest fires, we have the problem of the drought, which now affects 100% of mainland Portuguese territory: more than 80% of the country has suffered extreme drought and around 20% severe drought. It is horrendous.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe that we are building is first and foremost an area of solidarity; and that solidarity must be translated into action, even if the strict letter of the law does not quite match up to the hard reality that we are enduring. There is always more to life than can be covered in regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us wipe out misery, sadness, impotence, terror, anguish, death and the destruction of wealth. Let us raise the flags of confidence in the present and hope for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of urgent priority that we minimise losses of all kinds arising from the fires and the drought in Portugal. Portuguese citizens confidently expect a significant gesture of support from the citizens of other parts of Europe, a gesture that should be given material form by Europe’s institutions. This is the only way in which we will achieve more and better Europe. This is the only way in which Europe will fulfil its destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Ribeiro e Castro (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the end of July I have been keeping a close eye on the terrible tragedy of the forest fires throughout the country. Quite apart from the widespread destruction, it has caused panic and taken lives. There have been 18 fatalities in Portugal, including one Pedro Figueiredo, a dedicated firefighter from Oliveira de Azeméis, who was due to run in the October local elections on the basis of his extraordinary civic and community dedication.</p>
<p class="contents">The threat of large-scale fires has not gone away; it is still present. As recently as last night, coming from the interior of the country to make the journey here, I passed the great fire of Sardoal, which was still burning. We knew that this was going to happen this year, not only because of the experience of previous years and the weather forecasts, but also because our forests had become increasingly vulnerable as a result of the drought, the other plague ravaging my country and its countryside for a number of months now.</p>
<p class="contents">In April, during the debate and in Parliament’s resolution, which I was involved in tabling, the risk was already clearly forecast and clearly apparent. This is why I was taken aback by the apparent initial surprise that characterised the response and by the hesitation in some countries. I was similarly surprised by the decision taken by the Council of Ministers in June to scrap the firebreak subsidy. This decision was entirely incorrect in and of itself and especially absurd in a year such as this. The dire problem of the forest fires has created a deep sense that the Portuguese countryside has no hope, that it is unsustainable, and that it has been abandoned and neglected. Our forest is one of our greatest national treasures. There are many reasons why it is so vulnerable, and we must address all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as chairman of the party, I have tabled a proposal to set up a national agenda for the defence of the forest. Our desire is to work with others to ensure that this agenda is implemented rigorously and consistently until such time as we achieve security. It is also necessary, however, to look into the European-level implications of the issue and the reasons why Europe must step up its involvement in these activities. One of the reasons why the Portuguese forest is so vulnerable is the desertification of the country, the sudden, radical change in the demography of the countryside and the sudden abandonment of farming and traditional practices across large areas. In other words, let us not forget that there is another side of the common agricultural policy, which was never designed to address the realities of the Mediterranean. Consequently, we must look increasingly towards mobilising European solidarity in the tasks of rebuilding and managing the forests. The resolution that we have tabled represents a step in this direction and that is the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also set up a temporary committee of inquiry in order to raise our awareness of these realities. I wish to thank the President of the Commission for the way in which he responded in writing to the letter that I sent to him, in which he offered guarantees that the Commission would not fail to help my country and those worst affected. On the other side of the coin, I regret the Council’s absence, which sends out a pitiful message in response to such a large-scale tragedy in Europe.</p>

They give us the opportunity to demonstrate that we are prepared in difficult times to support each other.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate everyone who spoke earlier, especially on the unanimity which they expressed. We too are with them. We all support both the Portuguese with the fires which have affected them and the central Europeans with their floods. However, I would like to make one point.</p>
<p class="contents">Fires and floods have happened in the past and will always continue to happen. However, the majority of the scientific community states with certainty that, nowadays, these extreme weather conditions have increased in intensity as a result of ecological disaster, as a result of the climate change which we have brought about.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take advantage of this opportunity to sound the alarm and increase everyone's awareness of environmental protection issues. We know that the European Union sets great store by this issue and quite rightly so. Other major industrial powers, such as the United States of America, India and China, also need to understand that, unless we protect this environment, sooner or later it will fall on our heads.</p>
<p class="contents">One other point I would like to make is that blanket tree-planting both before and after fires must take greater account in future of the advice of forestry experts so that we plant more trees which do not burn easily.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point I wish to make – and the previous speaker made the same point – is that, over recent years, over recent decades, our mountain villages have been deserted. When people leave our forests, it is like guards leaving the army, it is like guards leaving the borders. We need to re-examine our rural policy so that mountain areas are not deserted, so that people stay in mountain villages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not the subject that is pleasurable, but the attitude demonstrated by the Commissioner and my fellow Members with regard to this grave matter. The reason I have been following this debate is not only because the region I represent – for example the village of Mád, an important area for Tokaj wine production – is one of those that suffered severe damage, and because in Romania, a neighbouring country to my homeland, the damage has reached devastating proportions. It is because I feel that here, in the European Union, we have to do a bit more than we have done so far.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the extent of the damage in Romania, let me tell you about the case of a village that was inundated by a two-metre-high wave of water in a twenty-minute cloudburst. I do not think this needs any further explanation. In such cases immediate rescue operations are required. If there were a civil protection force that could be deployed for rescue purposes at a European level, then even eurosceptic citizens of the Union would realise that the work we undertake together is worthwhile. Rescue operations are followed by reconstruction, and this requires money. We have funds for this purpose, but I agree with the previous speakers who have said that we should probably review the regulations relating to the way these are used. It is unacceptable that support should take more than a year to reach the beneficiary, or even that it should take nearly a year, as is now happening in the case of Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, many speakers have referred to the question of prevention. I think that EU resources should be used primarily for this purpose, as this is where they can be most effective. I agree with the previous speaker, for example, who gave particular importance to reviewing the situation as regards forestry from this perspective. However, this must be decided on the basis of thorough analysis rather than a bright idea from the Members of this House. For this reason, I support the proposal of my group to set up an ad hoc committee to deal with this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had terrible fires in southern Europe, dreadful floods in the USA, in China and, in particular, in the European Alps. The Vorarlberg, the Tyrol, Switzerland and many areas in Bavaria were seriously affected. The damage in my own homeland, the Tyrol, was massive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote you a few figures: the damage done to the public road network, to the system supplying drinking water, to the building of commercial roads and to communications amounted to hundreds of millions of euros. In total, over a thousand houses were damaged, and the destruction of factories and business premises meant that many people lost their livelihoods. It is obvious to all of us that we now need to act quickly, and, in particular, to be thorough in examining what caused this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Dimas has already highlighted a number of measures that have been taken. Although they amount to a good start, they must be followed by others, especially in view of the deficiencies in cross-border cooperation. The EU’s Solidarity Fund will also play its part, and we should adapt its rules to enable a proper response to major events of this kind, which affect whole regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Priority must, however, be given to thorough analysis. Let us not lose sight of the unfortunate fact that these natural disasters have become more devastating over recent years and that they are also occurring with far greater frequency. There is no doubt that the greater impact has to do with the more intensive exploitation on our part of confined spaces, particularly in mountainous areas, and also with the settlement of vulnerable areas. It follows that we have to give close consideration to what areas are amenable to settlement. Likewise, there is no doubt that the greater frequency is closely connected with global warming, but the way to address this is through continual research promoted by European programmes, particularly in exploring the possibilities of prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important, though, is that the results we obtain be given practical expression, and this will mean the Member States and regions taking their obligations seriously if we are to be able to prevent such terrible occurrences in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I saw at close quarters the fires in Portugal and Spain while they were still raging, and also the widespread devastation they wreaked.</p>
<p class="contents">Assistance cannot be denied to countries that have been struck by misfortune on such a large scale, and it is for this reason that I am naturally in favour of the motion for a resolution. A more general consideration comes to mind in this context, however. Europe is being hit by a great many disasters, and their number is increasing. Such disasters include fires in southern Europe and floods in central Europe. My country, Poland, is also frequently affected by floods, the worst of which occurred eight years ago. Other disasters to have hit Europe include hurricanes, as was the case not long ago in Slovakia, and even earthquakes.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be better prepared, firstly to prevent such disasters, and secondly to provide each other with assistance in dealing with their aftermath.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a general debate on the functioning of the system for preventing disasters and providing aid in the event of such disasters is needed. This debate would also deal with the joint measures we could take to improve this system, and should take place in a calm atmosphere and be unrelated to any specific event. I propose that such a debate be held in the not too distant future, or in other words over the next few months. The European Commission should also put forward comprehensive proposals to ensure that this debate is not merely held whenever there is a fire, flood or disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Disasters know no borders. We must therefore act together to develop cross-border disaster prevention systems, and provide each other with cross-border assistance to deal with their aftermath. We must work in a methodical and organised manner, however. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As mayor of Hradec Králové, I had first-hand experience of the floods which hit the Czech Republic, and which led to a number of our towns being inundated and many people being left homeless. Floods result all too often in the loss of life and property throughout Central Europe, for example in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Romania. Southern Europe, on the other hand, suffers from oppressive heat waves and ferocious fires. As we heard a short time ago, forest fires are still raging in Spain and Portugal, and I saw for myself the devastation they wreak during a trip to observe this summer’s regional elections in the Algarve region of Portugal. We should also not forget the windstorms that left a trail of destruction in the Baltic States and Sweden in January of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is engaged in discussions on its future, there is no better way for its institutions to win over the hearts and minds of the citizens of its Member States than by placing an emphasis on prevention and on the mobilisation of genuine aid, while also reducing the impact of natural disasters of this kind. I vividly remember the positive response of Czech citizens to the practical financial assistance provided by the EU following the floods that hit our country.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution due to be debated tomorrow, concerning the release of just under EUR 6 million from the Solidarity Fund to deal with the aftermath of the devastating hurricane that hit Slovakia last November, will also be a practical contribution. Back in January, I held in-depth discussions in Brussels with representatives of Slovak local authorities on the possibility of EU aid for the highest-lying regions of Slovakia, having organised the meeting in my capacity as an MEP and as President of the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic, in order to provide the representatives with information on the opportunities available and the way in which the European institutions work. At this time, Slovakia also asked the European Union for help in covering the costs of hurricane-related damage. Over seven months have now passed since this request was made, and yet the areas affected are still waiting for money. We are far from happy at these delays, and Members of this House should not be either. We therefore hope that an appropriate decision will be adopted and implemented as soon as possible, hopefully before the first anniversary of the hurricane that raged through the Tatra Mountains. We should not shirk our responsibilities, and we should lend our support to practical measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the problem of forest fires is not a new phenomenon. For over 13 years, the issue of preventing these fires and repairing the damage has been the subject of an action framework at Community level, and for years now the tragic consequences of these fires have met with sorrow in this House at the first part-session after the recess; it is high time that action was taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs firstly to strengthen cross-border cooperation. Very often, the Member States use incompatible equipment. There is also an urgent need to propose Community action programmes for civil protection that are worthy of the name. More generally, and without substituting for the Member States, the European Union must accord forests the status they deserve both at political and institutional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal on forestry strategy, which we are currently examining, seems to me to be slightly half-hearted. Forests make up 40% of the surface of the European Union. They generate significant economic activity and have environmental and recreational capacities that I will not point out here. They deserve better than a minor role between the environment and agriculture. For these reasons and in order to be even more effective, we must give serious thought to creating an Agency for Forests, not to mention – it is not a crime to dream – a Directorate General specifically focused on forests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With particular reference to two areas of European policy, namely rural policy and forestry policy, I should like to invite the Commissioner to consider whether we can deploy these policy measures more effectively in those regions that are being hit by drought or other climate-related disasters in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer primarily to southern Europe, southern Spain, but in particular southern Portugal and its cork oaks. The situation there shows that drought – not a man-made disaster therefore but long-term drought – constitutes a real threat, with all the consequences that this entails: drought stress in trees, including cork oak. We must see what we can do to offer those governments the opportunity of using either rural policy or forestry policy in order to combat stress diseases in those trees effectively. This is done far too little at the moment and I am convinced that if measures are not taken promptly, this will lead to climate change in those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to forestry policy, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and it would be good if in future, this policy could be used more to maintain traditional crops and indigenous tree species. They may not always be of great economic value, but they are vital if the nature and climate of the areas involved are to be maintained. In those areas, we could do a great deal by deploying rural and forestry policy to tackle those problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the South is being hit by a drought. In my own country, many fruit growers were badly affected by frost damage in February. It would be good if you were to make contact with your agricultural counterpart to assess to what extent the funds for rural policy can be used to pay compensation for extreme damage suffered in a specific year.</p>

That is why several Members – Mr Maat, Mr Prodi, Mr Turmes and others – have mentioned the connection between climate change and the recent phenomena and catastrophes. Over the last few months, the tragic catalogue of natural disasters has tested the European Union's civil protection response to the limit. Using the Commission's civil protection mechanism, the European Union has dispatched field hospitals, search and rescue teams and forensic experts to help to deal with the aftermath of the Asian tsunami. Pumps and medical supplies were sent to the flood-affected areas of Romania and Bulgaria. Water bomber aircraft and specialist helicopters were sent to deal with Portugal's forest fires. Today, the first consignments of European Union assistance arrived in the United States, following the destruction caused by hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p class="contents">Over this period, it has been demonstrated that the European Union system works, and works well. By pooling the civil protection resources of Member States, we were able to provide a common response that is more effective than any Member State can provide on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">A well-coordinated response is always more effective. In the natural desire to show solidarity with the victims of natural disasters, many nations spontaneously offer support, but without clear coordination there is a risk that assistance will be duplicated or that what is sent will not meet the real needs of the affected region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's monitoring and information centre provides a real-time service matching resources with requirements. In Romania and Bulgaria the crisis had passed by 24 August, when we received the message that no further international assistance was needed. Nevertheless, the situation could deteriorate quickly, and the Commission is continuing to monitor the overall flood situation in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania was immediately offered assistance by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom – almost all the Member States. The assistance took the form of intervention teams, highly specialised material and financial support. Assistance in the form of highly-specialised material was immediately offered to Bulgaria by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Malta, Sweden and Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal was offered assistance by France, two water bomber aircraft by Italy, one water bomber aircraft by Germany, as well as three Puma helicopters and four other helicopters, and Spain offered one water bomber aircraft in addition to bilateral assistance. The Netherlands offered two helicopters, Slovakia one. Norway also offered assistance, but those offers were not needed, so were not taken up. Today, in Portugal, there are only five fires. The Dutch helicopters will return tomorrow to the Netherlands and the German helicopters are still operating today but will be going home tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to what Mrs Grossetête said about arson. In Portugal, 98% of the fires were caused by humans. Twenty percent were caused by arson and the rest by negligence. Many people have been arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United States, the European Union's mobilisation is only just beginning. Following yesterday's request from the United States Government, the first European Union assistance arrived within 24 hours from Italy and Germany. It is important to note that, even though the rules of our civil protection mechanism prevent it from being activated until a formal request is received, Commission experts had contacted their US counterparts last week to explore areas where the European Union could provide the most help. We received the request yesterday morning.</p>
<p class="contents">It is too early to have a final picture, but it is clear that thousands of lives may have been lost. According to the United Nations, the cost of the damage is likely to be several times that of last December's tsunami. Even though the request for help was only received yesterday, a large number of states have already offered assistance, including medical teams, water purification equipment and heavy-duty pumps. I am aware that other Member States are in the process of preparing additional offers. Some of the assistance is already on site, whereas the rest is still being considered by the United States or is in the process of being dispatched.</p>
<p class="contents">The civil protection mechanism response to this year's natural disasters has provided a clear example of European Union added value. It is important that all Member States channel their assistance to the United States through that mechanism in order to avoid overlapping. We will use the United Kingdom Presidency as the contact point. That has worked very well up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pinheiro and others raised the question of whether the mechanism could work more efficiently. The mechanism has worked excellently up until now and help from the Member States has been coordinated immediately. Of course, there is still room for improvement. That is why, in April this year, the Commission made proposals which would effectively create a European civil protection force, more or less along the lines suggested by Mr Prodi and others.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard the comments today, I am confident that Parliament will support these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners, I would like to express solidarity with the continued suffering of the victims of hurricane Katrina. We are standing by to provide any assistance that might be needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
