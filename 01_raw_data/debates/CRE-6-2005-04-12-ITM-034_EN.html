<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hassi (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Parliament’s political groups, the shadow rapporteurs in particular, for their excellent levels of cooperation. The directive before us is an historic one: emissions from ships will be cut for the first time. The background to this is Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention, an agreement negotiated within the International Maritime Organisation IMO. This document states that certain sea areas can be defined as sulphur emission control areas. The highest permitted sulphur content in marine fuel in those areas is 1.5%. This is approximately half of the sulphur content of the most commonly used bunker oil currently, in which the average content is 2.7%. The sulphur emission control areas will be established in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel. In addition, the same sulphur limit is laid down for passenger ferries. From the year 2010 onwards a 0.1% fuel sulphur limit is to be introduced for ships at berth in ports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed high time to limit emissions from ships. Sulphur dioxide causes acid rain and damages both human health and the natural environment. The amount that billows up from solid earth wells has been dramatically reduced. For example in my own country, Finland, these emissions have dropped to a level which is below one seventh of the level in the 80s. On the other hand, ships are belching out more and more sulphur dioxide into the sky. A few years ago the sulphur emissions from ships in the Baltic Sea exceeded total emissions in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the restrictions laid down by this directive, the sulphur emissions in EU sea areas will in 10–12 years exceed the total for emissions from all power stations, factories and cars in the EU Member States. Even after the new restrictions, the allowed sulphur content of marine fuel can be as much as 300 times more than that in the fuel tank of an articulated lorry, even where sulphur use is restricted such as the Baltic Sea. The difference is even greater in the Mediterranean and other areas, not covered by the new restriction. Also the sulphur emissions of a cargo ship per tonne of freight are many hundred times greater than with an articulated lorry.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament did indeed want to go further in its first reading and demanded that the 1.5% sulphur limit should be extended to all EU sea areas and later on a further tightening of the limit down to 0.5% should follow. Calculations made by computer models used by the Commission show this to be viable. The extension of the 0.5% marine fuel sulphur content limit to all EU seas would produce human health benefits by, for example, decreasing the incidences of asthma and allergies by at least twofold and possibly even tenfold compared with costs incurred.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, however, rejected Parliament’s additional demands at first reading At second reading a clear majority of the Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety nevertheless decided to support the main issues of the first reading. In negotiations with the Council on the compromise reached in the first reading, many Member States announced that they would be prepared to turn down the whole reform. Consequently, the next stages of limiting emissions, as required by Parliament, could not be recorded in the directive itself. Instead, the Commission made a commitment, by a separate declaration, to prepare new and stricter emission limits. The declaration contains a clear reference to tightening the sulphur limit to 0.5% or below and to the use of economic means to manage it. These issues will be debated in connection with the revision of the directive in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">It was further recorded in the directive that the Commission and the Council are committed to promote through IMO the establishing of new sulphur emission control areas and making the sulphur limit more stringent. The sulphur limit referred to here is also 0.5%. In other words, we have the Commission’s and the Council’s commitments to tighten the limits of emissions from ships, as required by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with sulphur dioxide emissions we have become accustomed to the issue of acid rain, which is damaging to the natural environment and buildings, but which is also a serious and growing health problem. In the air sulphur dioxide forms particulate matter, which damages our lungs. According to a recent study, the number of people suffering from health problems caused by the particle matter is possibly as much as double previous estimates.</p>
<p class="contents">The natural environment is particularly vulnerable in the north, but peoples’ lungs are the same on coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea. We must therefore continue to limit sulphur emissions from ships. I trust that the Commission and the Council will stand by their commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the directive is to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and suspended particles. These emissions relate directly to the sulphur content of marine fuels, which are currently 2.7% on average or 27 000 parts per million, at a time when fuels for road transport, as Mrs Hassi said earlier, are subject to a new sulphur limit of 10 parts per million.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal therefore sets two limits for sulphur in marine fuels: a limit of 1.5% for all ships in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Channel and for all passenger ships throughout the European Union and a limit of 0.1% for vessels at berth in EU ports. These reductions will result in targeted reductions of emissions at no great cost, in a bid to combat acidification in northern Europe and improve at local level the air quality in all EU ports and coastal areas. The benefits to human health should include 2 000 life years saved every year as a result of improved air quality. As shipping is a global industry, it is important that the main points of the proposal have been brought into line with the internationally agreed regulations in Annex VI to the International Maritime Organisation's MARPOL Convention on the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships. The progress achieved at second reading of this proposal is satisfactory and I thank Parliament for the constructive role which it played in paving the way for agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Making a sufficient quantity of such fuel available would ensure improved air quality in the immediate vicinity of ports and coasts and reduce the harmful effect of acidic emissions on human health. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, for her excellently organised work and discussion on this issue and on the fact that we have reached an agreement which attains the objectives which were put forward. I am grateful to all those who supported our group’s proposal on a review report. Currently many issues are being debated on the basis of presumptions and not facts. Once the appropriate research has been carried out, we will still have to find a further solution which is the most environmentally friendly and most economically justified one – a solution which takes account of precise answers to various important questions. Does the production of reduced sulphur content fuel consume so much energy that it is likely to intensify the greenhouse effect? It is necessary to look at our priorities in strict compliance with the Kyoto protocol, since the adoption of this directive will increase the costs of water transport. Might the increase seriously threaten the cornerstone of the European Union’s transport policy, namely the reduction of transport by land truck and the redirection of the flow of freight towards other forms of transport? We must discuss our future actions also with the International Maritime Organisation, or else we may end up with a situation where changes affect only vessels registered in the European Union and those vessels whose final destination is Europe. Meanwhile, transit transport vessels will be able to use substantially cheaper fuel. In this event our maritime sector would be threatened and we might expect vessels in our fleet to be re-registered under the flags of third countries. The adverse effect of shipping emission gases must be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for serious work to be done on the review procedure so that in the long term we may have a high-performance fleet of vessels and so that appropriate protection may be provided for the European Union’s environment and public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Commission staff, who helped us a great deal in terms of the agreement that we have reached tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a compromise, but the question is whether it is good enough. Yes, there are some very good things in the compromise, which I welcome – and Mrs Hassi has listed them – but the Socialist Group believes that we still need to go further. We would have liked to see sulphur control areas extended to all EU waters. We want to see this as one step towards the use of lower-sulphur fuel in our shipping areas. In other words, we want to see a second phase in the legislation. We take the review clause, which was the object of the compromise, very seriously indeed. We hope that the Commission will go out and work in the IMO to bring more areas under the scope of this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is legislation that will make a difference. Two of the ports listed in the top 100 worst polluted ports in Europe are in my constituency. Last week, I was in one of those areas and was told about the black soot that lands on people’s washing lines and windows and affects people’s health. This is a piece of legislation that will help improve the environment and people’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that we are here yet again at 11.45 p.m. discussing important pieces of environmental legislation when the media has gone to bed and nobody is watching us.

I also share the view that the result would scarcely have been any better if we had forced the matter to a conciliation, something that would of course have been a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Sulphur emissions from many different sources have, of course, declined considerably in recent years. It has been possible to combat a large proportion of acidification problems in this way. Emissions from shipping are still very high, however, and ships use really dirty fuels not used elsewhere. The proportion of sulphur emissions specifically from shipping is at present indefensibly high. This legislation is therefore very important. The fact is, however, that it could have been significantly better. Resistance from a number of countries in the Council is the main reason why it does not make the most of the technical opportunities we in actual fact have to clean up emissions and fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in Parliament also bear a portion of the responsibility, however. At first reading, the PPE-DE Group was in favour of binding commitments to sulphur content of no more than 0.5%. Now, they have changed their minds, and one wonders why. Now, the objective of 0.5% sulphur content is only included as an option following a future review. That is something we regret. In other areas too, there has been a dismantling of what it would be within our powers to do. In spite of this, we shall vote in favour of this compromise, not because it is perfect but because we believe that it is as much as we can achieve this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When this issue was discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, it became apparent – to me at any rate – that there are many arguments in favour of reducing the sulphur content in fuels and few against. The introduction of a sulphur limit of 0.5% across the European Union would be 7.5 times more beneficial than the costs involved. That is why I think that the Council could have responded rather more positively to Parliament’s request to restrict the limit to 0.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">We are awaiting an assessment of Community policy on air quality; it is due shortly. We know that air quality is poor in a number of Member States, which is partly attributable to the emission of harmful substances by traffic not decreasing. Precisely at this time, the Council should have realised that if it considers air pollution to be a serious problem, it should also help find solutions. That is why I regret that the current compromise is all we have achieved. I will give it my support, but I hope it will be tightened up in future, and I would thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, for the unusually good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sulphur emissions cause great problems in terms of people’s health. They ruin buildings and the cultural heritage and cause lakes to become acidified. That is why it is also good that we in the EU have succeeded in reducing sulphur emissions, in any case from land sources, in recent years and that we are now moving forward on emissions from marine fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I, like many others in this House, am disappointed that we have not achieved more, especially regarding those points listed earlier by my colleague in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mrs McAvan. On this issue, we as parliamentarians have shown ourselves to be less green than our predecessors in office. I really do hope that this is an exception and that it will not be the case from now on that this Parliament is less green and takes less responsibility for our future environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, we are in any case opening the way for going further in a second phase and reducing sulphur emissions to a greater degree. There are many of us who will monitor whether this does in actual fact happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be specific, it contains more strongly-worded prospects for further reductions in the future, clarification as to the date of application to the North Sea, preconditions for the supply and distribution of fuels, so that ship operators know their obligations, an exemption from the application of berthing distance limits for vessels which use clean shoreside energy and an obligation for ships which use emission abatement technology to have continuous emission monitoring equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more important is the compromise package containing the much more strongly worded possibility for lowering limits still further, as far as 0.5% during the Commission review in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the amended review clause, the Commission must investigate the economic efficacy of any further measures, take account of the development of emission abatement technologies and study the possibility of submitting proposals on the introduction of financial measures to give industry the incentive to develop new environmental technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that all these elements were very important to Parliament at first reading and to the competent committee. Although we were not in a position to include the 0.5% limit on sulphur now, as the second stage of the directive, I can assure you that we have undertaken to examine the possibility of setting a limit of 0.5% in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">While acknowledging that the new limit of 1.5% for sulphur in marine fuels will remain 1 500 times higher than the sulphur content in fuels for road transport, the Commission firmly believes that shipping can and must reduce this limit, in order to retain its environmental credibility. That is the reason why the Commission has prepared a statement in which it clearly formulates its commitment to conducting a lengthy review of the directive in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">To use the specific term in English, which the rapporteur has borrowed from shipping terminology, I wish to emphasise that the Commission will do what it can to anchor environmental improvements to shipping in the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, the Commission is most satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations and wants to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, once again for her efforts to broker an agreement at second reading.
