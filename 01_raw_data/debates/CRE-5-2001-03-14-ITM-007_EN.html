It is immensely infectious and deadly. It also causes major financial damage and great suffering. It is therefore not surprising that this issue is a concern to Parliament now that the first outbreak in many years has been identified within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 February this year, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was identified in the UK. On 26 February, the UK informed the Council of Agriculture Ministers of the situation in the country and reported on the measures taken to prevent the disease from spreading. As you know, in this area the Council has left it to the Commission, based on decisions taken by veterinary surgeons from the Member States, to decide on measures generally taken by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with this, the Commission has taken decisions which mean the introduction of certain protective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The decision means a ban on the export from the UK of live animals, species which are susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, and milk, meat and other animal products from these species.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 March this year, the Commission took further decisions to ban all transportation of animals which can contract foot-and-mouth disease across the EU and to close down markets and collection centres for animals susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease across the EU. An exception to this decision allows transportation directly to an abattoir.</p>
<p class="contents">At an extraordinary meeting yesterday, the Standing Veterinary Committee was informed that an outbreak had also been identified in north-western France. Measures have been taken there similar to those taken in the UK. Naturally, the issue will be addressed at the next Council of Agriculture Ministers early next week. The EU Veterinary Committee will have its next meeting on 20 March, at which time the situation in the UK and France will be discussed again, along with possible future measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council regrets the situation in the UK and France and is closely following developments in close contact with the Commission, while at the same time Member States are taking various preventive measures. The Council has complete confidence in the measures which have been taken in the UK and France and in the way the two countries have dealt with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">An outbreak of so infectious and serious a disease as foot-and-mouth is always extraordinarily painful for everyone affected. However, it is particularly difficult when the outbreak affects a group already hard hit, comprising breeders, milk and meat producers and, in particular, smallholders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will recall that the first outbreak in the UK was confirmed in the evening of 20 February. The Commission adopted a safeguard decision the following day, 21 February. This measure imposed a ban on the export of certain live animals – cattle, sheep and goats – from the UK and restrictions on the export of meat, meat products, milk and milk products and certain animal products. Since then further measures have been introduced to ban movements of livestock throughout the European Union. This measure is precautionary and aimed at reducing any potential for the spread of the disease to a minimum. It must also be viewed in the context of the continued increase in cases in the United Kingdom. Any expectation that the crisis would end quickly have been disappointed. Clearly we need to be very concerned at the progress of the outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">Three factors in particular are disturbing. First, the continuing uncertainty over whether the incidence in the UK will peak, second, the discovery of a case in France which ends our hopes that the outbreak might be confined to the UK and third, the restrictions imposed by third countries, on imports of Community products, many totally unjustified. I would now like to look at each of these three concerns, beginning with the incidence in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clearly disappointing that expectations that the incidence of the disease would shortly peak have not been realised. The veterinary experts remain of the view that the restrictions on animal movements will, in time, limit the potential spread of the disease. This highlights the continued need for vigilance in the UK and for the strictest possible implementation of the measures already in place. Since the initial decision to ban exports of certain meat and meat products, dairy products and so on, there has been a ban on movements of livestock both in the UK and in other Member States. While these restrictions are naturally unpopular, they are a small price to pay compared to the consequences of not quickly eradicating this disease. I would hope that this greater good is not lost sight of in the present crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">So, turning to France, I am sure that everybody shares the Commission's concern at the discovery of the first case of the disease on the European mainland. As you are no doubt aware, a case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed yesterday in north-west France in the Mayenne region. It was detected in a cattle farm under restrictions imposed preventatively more than a week prior to the confirmation of the outbreak. The cattle farm is next to a farm to which incubating sheep had been imported from the United Kingdom on 16 February, a few days before the UK outbreak was known about. The sheep from the UK had been destroyed on 1 March as a preventive measure in accordance with the relevant Commission decision. The slaughter and destruction of all 114 cattle in the outbreak confirmed yesterday started yesterday evening and this operation is still on-going. This discovery dashes our hopes that the disease could be confined to the UK. However, we can take considerable comfort from the very decisive action taken by the French authorities to isolate and destroy livestock potentially exposed to contaminated animals imported from the UK. The early action to restrict movements of livestock in France should also have reduced the potential spread of the disease. These measures, wrongly viewed as excessive by some, have proved to be very prudent. Nonetheless, there is a risk of further outbreaks and the situation will have to be very closely monitored. The Standing Veterinary Committee took the decision late yesterday evening to ban exports of susceptible animals from France and also to impose restrictions on the movement of animals and certain products from the Mayenne department and the adjoining department of Orne. Clearly, any further outbreaks would require additional restrictions on the regions concerned, but the prompt action taken by the French authorities will hopefully ensure that there will be no need for more draconian measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to third countries. the Commission is deeply disappointed that the very decisive action taken to tackle the current outbreak has not received the recognition it deserves. Instead of being reassured by this action, third countries have, in many cases, responded with both excessive and, in my view, unnecessary restrictions. The Commission is consulting urgently with the third countries concerned to establish the basis and rationale for the restrictions. We shall, of course, be explaining the measures already in place, which make such restrictions unnecessary, and we shall make full use of our bilateral contacts and our WTO trade arrangements to have these restrictions lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already been in contact with the US Secretary of Agriculture this afternoon regarding the measures imposed by the United States. I was reassured by the Secretary that these measures will be reviewed urgently. We have agreed that our respective veterinary services should cooperate urgently on finding solutions. We agreed to remain in close contact until a solution is found and I am convinced of her goodwill in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example of the approach followed by the Commission, I would point to the Community approach towards Argentina. Beef imports have been permitted from Argentina despite its regional problems with foot-and-mouth disease. This was, of course, subject to very strict controls. The beef had to be from BSE-free regions, deboned and matured, to eliminate the risk of transmission of the disease. It was only following the further recent outbreaks, the introduction of vaccination and the self-imposed ban on exports to the United States and Canada that the Commission felt compelled to ban imports of beef from Argentina. The Commission remains nonetheless committed to a regionalisation approach in which exports can be allowed to resume in safe conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general level, I would once more like to defend the firm action taken by the Commission in dealing with the current outbreak. It is an essential and very necessary reaction to a highly infectious disease, with potentially huge economic and trade consequences for the entire European Union. This approach continues to enjoy the strong support of the Member States in the Standing Veterinary Committee and in the Agriculture Council. I firmly believe that the veterinary authorities, the Member States and the Commission have been working together very closely and effectively. The approach is also supported by EU farmers, who are very conscious of the grave threat to their livelihood from this disease. There is still a consensus that vaccination should be a last resort, to be introduced only in the circumstances I outlined before, namely as a preventive step to stop the further spread of the disease pending eradication measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with an assurance that the Commission will continue to put all its resources into eradicating this outbreak as quickly as possible. I continue to be impressed by the huge commitment of Member States to the rapid and decisive action to restore the entire EU to its previous disease-free status.</p>

There is no consumer risk. When the crisis is over – and it is a crisis in the UK, there is no other way to describe it – we will have to review the common agricultural policy and the whole single market to assess calmly whether we have, as an economic community, sacrificed our animal health status at the high altar of trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Foot-and-mouth disease was never just a UK issue and the outbreak in France tragically underlines this, if we needed reminding. While the spread of this virulent disease has raised legitimate questions about how the UK authorities are handling it, I would like to dissociate myself and my colleagues from the intemperate and highly inappropriate comments made by certain junior ministers in the Irish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding bans on imports of animals and animal products and limited transport bans, Commissioner, I must say that the reaction of the EU collectively appears to be inadequate and slow. Are you satisfied with the veterinary capability to handle this crisis, particularly in the United Kingdom? Are you satisfied that the Standing Veterinary Council is up to the job? I am not questioning their individual capabilities, but do their brief and terms of reference now appear adequate in the face of rampant foot-and-mouth disease? Could the Commissioner explain to the House why there is such a difference in the veterinary responses of the UK and Ireland? Certainly each Member State is responsible in the first instance for its own animal health, but it is clear to me and my colleagues from other Member States that there is no coordinated or consistent veterinary response. In the UK racing, football matches, conferences continue, despite the fact that there have been well over 200 outbreaks and I have heard of another 28 today. In the Republic of Ireland, where we have no outbreak, all non-essential gatherings in rural areas have been stopped. We have brought the Irish community to a standstill.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no coordinated logistical policy on movements of animals and most importantly movements of people to and from infected areas and countries through ports and airports. Standards and requirements differ drastically and we urgently need an EU approach to that. The EU reaction has been inadequate and slow. The disease is out of control in Britain and has now spread to continental Europe. I am amazed that there has been no emergency meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers to date and no coordinated response from any of our executive authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just listened to the UK National Farmers' Union address the meeting of our Agriculture and Rural Development Committee and I thank them for attending. They have explained the situation in England.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not support vaccination, tragic as the problem is, since foot-and-mouth disease is not endemic in the EU. Vaccination is not a 100% guarantee and there are many different strains, each requiring a different vaccination.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is your job to convince Member States that all airports, seaports and other entry and exit points in infected areas must be controlled and passengers and vehicles must go through a proper disinfectant routine. It is time we got our act together and lessons should be learned from the BSE crisis. We need more details from Argentina. Despite denials of an outbreak of the last few weeks they have now confirmed that there is one. I do not think we have all the facts yet, from there or from other countries.</p>

I think we can reassure consumers, since this disease cannot be transmitted to humans, but it is more difficult to quell the fears of farmers and operators in the industry who have already had to face the terrible consequences of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I too want to express my determination not to succumb to panic. For almost ten years, there have been very few outbreaks and the outbreaks in 1993 in Italy and 1996 and 2000 in Greece appear to have been rapidly brought under control. In the current situation, and in the light of experience, it would appear fitting to get rid of the contaminated animals. This seems to be the most effective way of giving us hope that the source of the virus can be wiped out. At the same time, we must support the industry in this time of crisis and compensate farmers adequately so that we do not wipe out a profession as well as herds.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to place the fight against this virus on an international level, as it is moving around the globe. It is in Asia, in India, in Latin America and Argentina. It is in Europe; hence my questions. How did this virus get to Europe from Asia? Has the story of the on-board meals of an airline company been adequately explained? What international prevention strategies can be put in place given, on the one hand, the extreme mobility of the virus and, on the other, the importance of passenger and goods traffic across the globe? What use are international guarantees if States cover up by not making declarations or by submitting inadequate declarations to the International Office of Epizootic Diseases?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Minister and President-in-Office, Commissioner, we really need you to explain these various aspects to us. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think they have all been alert and that that all possible precautionary measures were taken. Nevertheless, I wonder whether that was enough. I paid a visit to the United States not so long ago. Each time I enter that country, I am always struck by the fact that I have to state whether I have been on a farm over the previous three weeks and whether I am bringing foodstuffs with me. All this to check whether any contagious diseases are being imported into the United States. This does not happen in Europe. Would this not be the right time to ask ourselves whether this is not a necessary course of action here too? With all those jumbo jets arriving at our airports every day, the risk of infection from wherever in the world is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate whether or not to vaccinate is once again upon us. Could the Commission spell out the economic implications of vaccinating and what benefits non-vaccination brings? It is true that we have had no problems for the past nine years, but I think that the public must be convinced of the need for this policy. We must know how much it will cost.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has increased the budget line for “SOS countryside” over the past six years. Last year, the Commission refused to implement this budget line. It pays for a telephone line which can be used by any farmer across the European Union. Why does the Commission not implement this budget line and why is there an inclination to shelve it again<span class="bold"> </span>this year? This is about a clear-cut wish from Parliament and I think that it is extremely well-timed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we see that states are banning trade in meat amongst each other. This proves that this crisis is, first and foremost, of a commercial nature. Let us stop seeing it as a health crisis. Let us stop mixing up the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, we no longer talk about another crisis which is also moving around the globe: that of BSE. Commissioner, what has happened to the tests? What has happened to the controls on meat and bone meal? These are questions which must be tackled alongside this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you are corrupting the precautionary principle. I am telling you this very politely as an ecologist. We are killing and burning animals on a massive scale, even though foot-and-mouth disease is not dangerous to humans. What is more, healthy animals can recover from foot-and-mouth disease. But it is not worthwhile commercially.</p>
<p class="contents">So get things into perspective and propose valid solutions. Yes, you are slaughtering animals. Perhaps in the short term, and to get out of this crisis, it might be necessary to envisage a system which does not totally rule out vaccination in very restricted zones. The priority is to get out of the crisis. But once the crisis has passed, apply the precautionary principle and tackle the causes rather than the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said at another time and in another place, you want to tackle the transportation of live animals, for example. It is not enough! Eight hours is too long to transport live animals! A stop must be put to this system. We must turn our backs on intensive and battery farming. Adopt long-term measures to put an end to this atrocious form of production and to return to extensive farming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although draconian measures have been adopted in the various Member States, we must recognise the risk that the disease will spread. We are facing an extremely virulent strain and the environmental conditions lead us to fear the worst.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of foot-and-mouth disease can be approached from three angles: the actions which must be taken immediately or in the short term, the establishment of responsibility and the prevention of these problems in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make three observations. Firstly, in the short term, the economic effects of implementing a vaccination campaign would be just as bad as not implementing one and the consequences would be extremely hard to bear. Now, if we reject vaccination, we would have to respond in a tough manner to the measures adopted by Canada. The European Union cannot suffer in silence in the face of generalised and unjustified embargoes such as Canada’s or the deviousness of the United States’ behaviour towards us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner, is there going to be compensation for farmers as a result of this horrendous crisis? Where will the money come from? According to my calculations, only EUR 50 million is available in compensation to livestock farmers, after the latest proposed budgetary review, for foot-and-mouth disease and also for BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">A third and final observation. With regard to the prevention of this and other diseases we should consider the repercussions of the quest for competitiveness, resulting from a reduction in aid from the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also consider the risks of Community livestock farming based on the transportation of live animals and high concentrations of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis surrounding us should lead us to draw up a CAP aimed at serving the consumer and the producer rather than commerce. Therefore, we should direct aid so as to guarantee the viability of farms which present fewer environmental risks and risks to the consumer and which are necessary for maintaining the social fabric of rural life, rather than reducing aid or eliminating it altogether. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the House is aware, the first outbreak of foot-and-mouth was confirmed in Great Britain just a few weeks ago. Since then it has spread at a frightening rate, resulting in the destruction of thousands of animals. The financial implications are considerable. The psychological impact on farmers, not just in Great Britain but also in Ireland, is a matter of great concern. Let us not underestimate the social consequences of this catastrophe. We all know that foot-and-mouth is a difficult disease to control, but its implications for European agriculture and the broader European economy require that the most stringent controls be put in place and enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that for the British Government the situation is difficult. However, there is nothing to be gained at this stage by apportioning blame. I certainly sympathise with the plight of British farmers. I believe the scale of the disaster and the rapidity with which it has spread demand not just stronger action by the British authorities but also continuing EU intervention. I compliment Commissioner Byrne on his measured and positive response to the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The threat that foot-and-mouth represents to the Community as a whole is a matter that cannot be left to the control measures in individual Member States. I call on the Commission to appoint a special task force to oversee the implementation and the enforcement of regulations in the countries concerned. The work and guidance of the Standing Veterinary Committee is, of course, important in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will understand if I highlight the seriousness of the situation for Ireland, where very strict controls already are in place. I should like to acknowledge the understanding of the public and the level of cooperation between the authorities north and south of the border. It is ironic that it has taken this dreaded disease to bring home to our people not just the implications for farmers but also the consequences for employment in the food industry, the impact on food exports and the economic threat to tourism and other commercial activities.</p>

This is not a coincidence, it is a combination of the ideological errors made in European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The first error is the ideology of globalisation, which Mrs Auroi spoke about. The virus arrived from India; it could have arrived from Pakistan; it could have arrived from Zimbabwe. When everything is allowed to move around freely, even the foot-and-mouth virus moves around freely.</p>
<p class="contents">The second error is the race to achieve profitability. In the name of health precautions, we wanted to have abattoirs which were like laboratories at the Pasteur Institute. Abattoirs were integrated and animals were sent there from the length and breadth of Britain. That is how the virus spread throughout the whole of Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">The third error is that of immigration. The 20 000 sheep imported into France, which introduced the British virus, were destined to have their throats slit according to the sacrifice of Abraham as part of the Muslim festival of Aïd el Kebir. With the carotid from these sheep we got the virus for free!</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth error is that of the race for profits. Vaccination was suppressed in the name of Adam Smith and in the name of profitability. And in the name of Adam Smith British trains go off the rails, British cows go off the rails and British sheep go off the rails!</p>
<p class="contents">So what are we to do in the face of such serious errors? Well, the solutions seem to lie in two directions. The first is that of justice, taking responsibility for compensating innocent farmers. The second is that of moderation: a sense of moderation for animals, who do not need to be slaughtered as they recover after a few weeks; a sense of moderation in the media, who are playing a game of Apocalypse Now; a sense of moderation in terms of health with vaccination, as in Argentina; and a sense of moderation for the European industrial agricultural model, which should achieve greater moderation and balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Foot-and mouth disease, which we thought we had confined to Great Britain, has now reached continental Europe. The massive abattoirs have changed nothing. We are losing our export markets. The United States and Canada have just closed their borders, placing our farmers in a very difficult situation. This scourge affects pig farmers and cattle producers, who have already been greatly weakened by BSE and other diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">If the situation were to get worse despite the efforts of the Member States to eradicate this disease, would you undertake to provide vaccines as soon as possible? We must also realise that no compensation will totally make up for the financial loss and, above all, the loss of morale. Our farmers have been ground down and we must help them. Although the Swedish Prime Minister declared that there was no question of increasing aid, what do you propose to do to support them?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is built around agriculture and it has to be recognised that, in such a situation, we must call on Member States to manage the crisis, as it did in the case of BSE.

Foot-and-mouth – because it is such a highly infectious disease – is the last straw. It is hardly surprising that farmers – but not only farmers – are calling for rigorous action to be taken and, with your permission, I should like to ask a few questions about this.</p>
<p class="contents">First: do you know the exact extent of the epidemic at the latest count?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: farmers are anxious to know if the foot-and-mouth vaccination has been abolished once and for all. What are you thinking of doing here, given the current circumstances, for stock in general and for particularly valuable animals, such as animals on stud farms?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: transportation is once again centre stage. Is the transportation of animals and meat within the European Parliament being jointly controlled? And if so, how? What sanctions are to be applied in the event of infringement?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: all imports of animals and animal products into the Community are a source of concern. Argentina can supply what customers want: beef which is guaranteed free from BSE. That is something at least. But, as you said, they have foot-and-mouth disease. What specific protection and what safety measures have you introduced here, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">And fifthly: my last point – and it is an important point – concerns the cost of foot-and-mouth. Who pays what and what funds do you think the EU should provide?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission willing to learn from experience with the BSE crisis and act now, rather than just react as and when it has to in order to contain the foot-and-mouth epidemic? For me this means that the Commission itself should take action as well as coordinating national measures.</p>

Transportation of live animals is currently being investigated by the Commission and I eagerly await the Commission's report on this very important issue and urge the Commission once again to change its policy on the transportation of live animals and to introduce stricter controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequential loss is not covered when discussing the issue of compensation. Does the Commission not agree that it is imperative that we look at the whole picture and evaluate the loss to farmers directly and indirectly affected by the foot-and-mouth outbreak as well as the connected industries and tourism? How many more disasters do we have to witness in the agricultural industry before Member State governments agree that the reform of the common agricultural policy is urgently needed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Could the Commissioner tell me whether the British Government has applied for all the EAGGF funding available to them? In the past it has not bothered to take this. Has it taken advantage of this for this current national tragedy? Mrs Doyle said that it was a crisis. Indeed it is a crisis: 225 cases at present, a quarter of a million animals to be slaughtered! Our minister said on television three days ago that it is under control. Could the Commission tell me whether it is under control?</p>
<p class="contents">Could I also ask what the EU is doing? Has the British Government approached the EU for some sort of consensus on how we stop this spreading across Europe? I noticed when I travelled into Europe the other day there were no disinfectant mats, there were no bloodhounds checking whether I had a ham sandwich in my pocket, no questions. I know that when you travel to other countries you are questioned about what you are carrying. Has the veterinary advice been coordinated? We seem, as Mrs Doyle said, to have a huge variation between Member States across the European Union. Is it safe to transport infected carcasses across the United Kingdom as we are doing at the moment? Finally, has the British Government been particularly lax about stopping imports from countries where the disease is endemic?</p>

The food industry in Ireland and now in Europe as a whole is reeling under the impact of the foot-and-mouth catastrophe, but it is wrong to demonise any one country for this outbreak. It is particularly silly for a minister of a state which exports 90% of its produce to do so. It could have happened in any one of our countries, given the intensive subsidy-driven nature of European farming, which involves the constant movement of livestock from farm to farm and indeed from country to country.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not convinced that partial or reasonable bans on the movement of livestock are an adequate response at this stage in the development of the outbreak. In practice I would have to say that no country is likely to import animals from any country where the disease has been identified – and indeed who would blame them?</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been repeated that this is not a human health crisis. Also, the farming sector is not the only victim of this crisis. Food industry workers, the tourism industry, sporting events and everyday social life are all victims of the efforts to stop the spread of the disease. While that has been acceptable up to now, we must not dismiss out of hand a review which balances the costs involved in continuing with the current approach and its impact on other key industries and on the freedom of citizens to get on with their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, when the anger and recriminations have died down, we must get to grips with a reform of the common agricultural policy. European consumers are now more interested in safe food, food that is produced in an environmentally friendly way, and indeed food at affordable prices. But they are no longer interested in dirt-cheap food, regardless of how it is produced or with hidden unacceptable health risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Health risks to livestock, changes in eating habits and the collapse of the production sector are ample cause for us to take extraordinary decisions.

<p class="contents">What position will you adopt in relation to third countries?

<p class="contents">What is going to happen with regard to wild animals, Commissioner? What measures are envisaged for wild animals and for zoos, circuses, etc.? What will happen if deer, wild boar or goats are affected?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – A number of different issues were raised. Perhaps I might deal briefly with those, rather than go through the individual questions, and hope that I touch on all of the issues, particularly the important ones.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, regarding globalisation, it should be stressed that foot-and-mouth disease was prevalent – even endemic – in many Member States in the past when trade was a tiny fraction of present levels. So to identify trade as being the cause of this is, in my opinion, a simplistic response. Foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in the developing world. The EU has a huge trade surplus in food and agricultural products. So do we wish to surrender the resulting benefits? Trade in agricultural products is one of the areas where the developing world has real potential to increase trade. I am personally asking my own officials to advise me about raising the standards in developing countries so that they are in a position to trade with the European Union. This is an important issue. We must not lose sight of that. Are we to tell these countries that we do not want their products for the reasons that we have discussed here this afternoon? The other route is the better one.</p>
<p class="contents">Intensive farming is another issue that was raised. I should repeat that the foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in the developing world. Conversely, it is extremely rare in the OECD countries: the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand. That is an important issue to be taken into account. There farming is at its most intensive. So, once again, to identify the debate as being one that focuses on intensive and extensive farming is also, in my opinion, an inadequate response to a complex issue. Intensive farming has a lot to answer for but it is simplistic to see this as the cause of the current outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport was another issue that was raised. It is a Commission policy and priority to reduce the incidence of long-distance live animal transport. A number of you asked the question "Is this under control?". The restrictions on animal movement will minimise the risk of transmission of the disease. This will, in turn, eventually ensure that the outbreak is brought under control. It remains to be seen, however, how long this will take. A lot depends on the amount of trade that took place before we first knew about this outbreak. We will have to wait for the passage of incubation periods before we get a better picture of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many measures advocated by Members such as restrictions on sporting events, for example, are simply outside the competence of the Commission and outside the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to controls, I should also emphasise that it is likely that this outbreak commenced in the United Kingdom as a result of illegal activity. I must stress this. A number of people have asked why the Commission does not bring forward more proposals. That is always the standard response when something happens. The legislation is there. It was a breach of the legislation which caused this illegal activity to spark off this particular infection in the UK. I should also emphasise that it is the responsibility of Member States to seek to properly enforce the legislation relating to this and other matters. I can only draw your attention to the discussions we have had here before in relation to questions surrounding BSE. Controls and enforcement are important. We must not lose sight of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have dealt with most of the issues you have raised.</p>
