<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span><span class="italic"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, five years after its adoption, the European Council is to be asked to debate once again the relaunching of the Lisbon strategy, on the occasion of the mid-term review thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission has proposed, we must give this strategy a new start, by concentrating our action on achieving stronger and more sustainable growth and on creating more better-quality jobs. The European Council will therefore be able to confirm the relevance of the strategy by clarifying its purpose as well as what is at stake. The objectives of growth and employment must be pursued via a process of synergy which must be developed between the three dimensions of the strategy, namely the economic, social and environmental dimensions. In this context the European Council will also set the priorities which should guide the Union’s action in the social sphere. A re-examination of the social agenda must, in fact, supplement and support the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, particularly as regards the promotion of the social dimension of economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the environment is concerned, the European Council should emphasise the contribution to growth and employment made by environmental policy, and should confirm the need to integrate environmental considerations into the Lisbon process. Moreover, the European Council will also be examining the Commission’s communication on the sustainable development strategy, but I shall come back to that later because this is an issue which forms an entirely separate item on the Council’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will also be examining the question of how to improve the governance of the strategy, both Union-wide and at the level of the Member States. The question of governance really lies at the heart of the mid-term review. It will be a crucial factor in the success of the strategy. As far as the Presidency is concerned, this complex issue can be boiled down to a few essential points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the adoption of a set of integrated guidelines making it possible to synchronise and rationalise the various processes which exist at present. The fact that there are so many processes and reports is actually responsible, to a large extent, for the lack of transparency of the strategy as perceived by the public, and prevents it from being effectively implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the broad guidelines provided by the European Council, the Commission should now submit proposals for guidelines comprising the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines, and should combine them in a single coherent text. Those integrated guidelines would then be endorsed by the European Council and, where required by the Treaty, would be formally adopted by the Council. It goes without saying that, within this process, the views of Parliament will be fully taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the introduction of the three-year national action programmes. This gives Member States greater flexibility in choosing the priorities and methods of action which they use in order to implement the strategy, within the framework laid down by the integrated guidelines to which I have just referred. It is proposed that, on the basis of these integrated guidelines, Member States should work out in detail their national action programmes, following the broadest possible consultation between all those involved. In order to facilitate consultation and coordination, and the implementation of what is decided upon, each Member State would be able to appoint one public figure who would be responsible for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a monitoring procedure based on a regular assessment of implementation at intermediate meetings. The idea is that, each autumn with effect from 2006, Member States should submit a single report on the implementation of their national action programme. On that basis the Commission will submit, in January of each year, an assessment report, where necessary accompanied by certain proposals for adjustments, but without that being able to lead to the total reshaping of the integrated guidelines, which will be valid for a period of three years. The European Council will then give its opinion on those adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, in its various formations, is continuing its work on all the issues linked to the review of the Lisbon strategy, and the General Affairs Council will return to this matter on 16 March, just before the European Council meeting. These, then, are the major proposals which are currently being discussed and prepared with a view to the European Council meeting on 22 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barroso,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (PT)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, a month ago, at the Conference of Presidents, I put forward our ideas for a partnership for sustainable growth and employment, thus giving new impetus to the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective for this partnership is simple: we have to modernise and invigorate our economy and our social model, and we must improve our quality of life through truly ambitious reforms. We have to realise that appropriate environmental policies can result in twin benefits, in terms of employment and ensuring lasting growth; and, in the context of economic stability, we have to improve the ability of our businesses – from the very largest to our small and medium-sized enterprises – to create more and better jobs. We also have to enhance productivity through greater investment in knowledge, innovation and people.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is the first opportunity for one of the partners with whom we want to work – one of the most important partners, the European Parliament – to express its views and establish its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Both I and the other members of the Commission welcome this debate. We want to thank you for the political investment that you have made in order to table a global motion for a resolution that reflects the vast spectrum of opinions within this House. We share many of your priorities, and we are sensitive to your concerns. </p>
<p class="contents"> Later today we will debate the forthcoming European Council. That summit will be the start, and not the end, of the journey as far as the renewed Lisbon Strategy is concerned. I fully support the remarks made by the distinguished representative of the Luxembourg presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only succeed if everyone feels that they have a stake in Europe’s success. That success depends on presenting a vision that mobilises popular support, gives a real sense of ownership and, above all, leads to real action at a national, regional and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to mobilise support it must be clear why these reforms matter and that they are part of our wider vision. They are about people and the issues that matter most to them: the chance to work, a decent start for their children, security in retirement or ill-health, and quality public services. They are about a better quality of life and a better standard of living in every part of an enlarged Union, from our city centres to the heart of our rural and coastal communities. They are about binding the Union together through 21st-century infrastructure and regional investment. They are about making the most of European excellence in our business community – addressing, in particular, the concerns of small- and medium-sized enterprises – and in all areas of creativity, but also in science and technology and in our unique model for society.</p>
<p class="contents">They are also about achieving all this in a way that guarantees future generations the same or better possibilities than we ourselves enjoy. This goal of sustainable development underpins the Lisbon Strategy as it does the action of the Union in every area.</p>
<p class="contents">These are broad economic, social and environmental objectives. They were at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy when it was launched and remain at its heart today. I can promise you that this Commission will fight to ensure that they do so tomorrow, not least as we discuss the future financial perspectives over the months ahead. Then and there we will test the real commitment to cohesion and solidarity of those who are today – at least in their political discourse – on the frontline of defence of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we need to face facts. The first five years of the Lisbon Strategy have not delivered the desired results. There has been insufficient delivery, little ownership at national level and even less among society at large. In key areas, from productivity to research and education spending, early school-leavers or poverty, we have barely made an impression on closing the gaps that existed five years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We can add to this the challenge of intense global competition and an ageing population. These are no longer challenges for the future, but the day-to-day reality for our businesses and workers. This is why Lisbon needs a new start, with fresh ambition. This is why we propose a new focus on growth and jobs in order to meet those challenges. A dynamic and innovative Europe offers us the best chance to do this. Vice-President Verheugen will set out in more detail how this new focus translates into concrete action and results.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean downgrading action in other areas. Our new social agenda, our review of sustainable development and our action on climate change show the Commission’s commitment to moving ahead across a wide range of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to two specific concerns that your resolution addresses. The first is the balance within the Lisbon Strategy. I know a variety of concerns have been raised about the new focus on actions to promote growth and jobs. This is not at all in contradiction with our social and environmental policy. Growth is a necessary precondition for an effective and more ambitious programme in terms of solidarity, just as fighting unemployment is the best protection against exclusion and poverty. Without growth, without a dynamic economy, there will be no sustainable development; we will not foster convergence between regions and our social and environmental goals will slip out of reach. However, I fully accept that lasting growth relies, in turn, on parallel progress on cohesion, our social agenda and addressing unsustainable and damaging environmental trends.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the services directive, we need an open and thriving internal market for services in the Union, as well as high-quality, accessible public services. They are key factors for a successful society. Yet we have identified a number of areas where changes will be required for the broad consensus that we would like to see to emerge. We have said that we are ready to work pragmatically with you, the Parliament, and with the presidency, in preparation for your first reading. In particular we need to ensure a framework that removes the risk of social dumping, has a broad coverage – but does not necessarily cover healthcare or services of general interest – and addresses genuine concerns about the operation of the country of origin principle. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me end by saying a few words about the governance of the Lisbon strategy. I do not think that it is necessary for us to rewrite the Lisbon strategy completely in the course of the next few weeks. Having said that, however, a certain number of innovations have been suggested by the Commission and – let us not forget – by Parliament too.</p>
<p class="contents">We proposed that a European Institute of Technology should be created, that greater priority should be given to improving the regulations, particularly in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, that there should be a greater emphasis on re-examining existing proposals, that the rules on State aid and taxation should be used in a way that would encourage the spirit of enterprise, innovation and research, that employment market reforms should concentrate on measures to help women, young people and older workers to find and keep jobs, and that a European Pact for Youth should be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, I think we can say that people have a pretty clear idea of what needs to be done. The political challenge this time around lies in finding out how, at Community level, we can help them to do it in reality. It is all a matter of ownership. It is primarily because Member States – and society in general – have not made the structural reforms their own that a number of those reforms have produced disappointing results over the past five years. In response to this situation, we have made the following proposals, which you seem to approve of, if your motions for resolutions are to be believed.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we are proposing the formulation of integrated guidelines at European Union level, combining the current Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines, so as to give Member States a clearer idea of what action they are committing themselves to. For the first time, micro-economic reforms will be dealt with in detail. This will therefore be an integrated vision encompassing macro-economic policies, micro-economic reforms and employment policy, so that Lisbon will not have a purely decorative role, but will really lie at the heart of our economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are proposing the development of national Lisbon programmes adapted to fit national situations. Of course, the initiative will lie with Member States, but we have already prepared, at the same time, a European Union programme on the Lisbon strategy, which offers initiatives at Community level and thus explains in detail what needs to be done at Community level and what needs to be done at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are proposing the simplification of the compulsory provision of information, at both Community and national level, so that Member States can devote more time to implementing the reforms and less time to writing reports about them which most people will ignore. Therefore less importance should be attached to reports than to an integrated vision of the reforms currently taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our ambition to develop active participation in these reforms, and to put them at the heart of national political debates. The European Council taking place this spring will not be the end of the road: on the contrary, it will give political impetus to the new approach. However, in order to be entirely consistent, the broad policy guidelines defined in March will have to guide the financial decisions to be taken in June. The Union must not be content with being ambitious. If it wants to succeed, it will also have to mobilise resources to match its ambitions. In this respect, a proactive agreement on the financial perspective, placing the proper emphasis on cohesion, would be a crucial factor in strengthening and developing our social model over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Council will also be opening the way for debates at national and regional level on the action programmes which Member States have been asked to submit this autumn. I personally expect a great deal from these debates. The Lisbon strategy must take its inspiration from the partnerships and dialogues which the cohesion policy has put in place in recent years between the various people involved at national, local and social level. Unless this happens, it will not be possible to mobilise those partners who are affected by its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just say that, following my meetings with the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, I find it very encouraging that those institutions have, generally speaking, warmly welcomed our review of the Lisbon strategy. I am also particularly pleased to see the joint declaration issued recently by the two major European trade-union and employers’ organisations. It is, therefore, possible to reach a balanced consensus on ambitious reforms. It goes without saying that within this partnership the Members of the European Parliament will play a major role if we really want to implement these reforms. This is why I am asking you to make your contribution each year to the work of the spring European Council which, in accordance with the Treaty, lays down the guidelines which will direct the process, and also, of course, to take the lead in the political discussions which will mobilise support at national, regional and local level. This is our conception of the partnership which this Commission wishes to establish with you. We believe that, on that basis, and with that commitment, it will be possible to do much more for our Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, the great growth and employment initiative that we are discussing in this House today is the Commission’s most important project for the coming five years, by the success of which we – and not we alone – will, we know, be judged. All European institutions will be judged by whether or not this growth and employment initiative is a success, for the people of Europe expect us to really reverse a trend and keep Europe up to the mark in global, and ever more acute, competition at a high level – and I emphasise ‘at a high level’. The prescriptions that we sometimes hear for how to deal with the perils of an ageing society, with the dangers of increasing globalisation, with the ever-more complicated ways in which work is shared out around the world, the prescriptions that we sometimes hear to the effect that competitiveness must be achieved by cutting wages and downgrading social and environmental standards – such prescriptions are wrong. Instead of being able to indulge in downward competition, we will have to hold fast to the fact that Europe’s ability to compete is dependent on the quality of its goods and services and on the leading position that they occupy, and we should not be too abashed to say loud and clear that something made and sold in Europe can not only claim to be ‘number one’ in terms of technology and quality, but also that it embodies certain European values, such as the idea that our products and services cannot come into being by dint of the ruthless exploitation of the environment or ruthless trampling on people’s rights. I am firmly convinced that, in the long term, such a European philosophy of economic policy gains us a competitive advantage, for the other dynamic regions of the world cannot get away from the fact that people want higher environmental and social standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to explicitly stress that the growth and employment initiative, the new Lisbon agenda, is a project that can work only if it is understood as being founded on partnership. People may well think, ‘right, let that lot in Strasbourg and Brussels get on with it, and we’ll watch them fail yet again’, but it can only work if the European institutions and the Member States regard this project as a shared responsibility. The President has just had something to say about the doubts expressed by some Member States about the way we intend to implement this strategy, and it is they whom I am addressing when I say that we have no intention of building up a ponderous mechanism of reporting, recommendations and sanctions; what we want is a model in which we, together, set out and analyse the policy’s outcomes. We do, however, need to have these summarised in a progress report, and that has to be based on progress reports from the Member States. These are nothing for anyone to be afraid of, for, even now, the Member States have to submit detailed reports; indeed, what we are now proposing reduces the burden on them. Nobody need have any fear that the Commission plans to draw up rankings, or, as one says, to ‘name and shame’ anyone, but we must be able to see clearly what we have achieved in a year and what we have yet to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission is pressing hard for the governments of the Member States to appoint members – ministers – who will have responsibility for coordinating the Lisbon strategy in their countries. This strategy must have faces associated with it. The most natural solution would be for this function to be taken on by the ministers who sit on the Competitiveness Council, whose remit includes the Lisbon Strategy in any case. That would also enable this Council, which is currently looking for a new role, to find one and be much more effective in playing it. The Commission is very, very emphatic in recommending this option.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to make is that I will, in the course of this year, be producing a series of important initiatives to flesh out the project’s European dimension. Everything that the Commission presents will be subject to prior approval, judged in terms of what contribution a particular project or initiative makes to growth and employment in Europe. That is the question that must be answered in all cases, and answer it we will. We will very soon be presenting to you major policy initiatives in my own area of responsibility, and the order in which I shall now list them is a matter of deliberate choice. First of all comes better lawmaking. The ‘Better Lawmaking’ project has, to put it tactfully, been trundling along for some considerable time. It needs a clear political direction. It has to be clear that improved lawmaking is something that has an immediate and direct effect on the productivity and quality of the European economy. It is another thing that we cannot work for unless we do it together. Parliament has a great part to play in this, as does the Council, as do the Member States and the Commission. It is not just about future lawmaking and how we ensure that it improves competitiveness; it is also about the <span class="italic">acquis </span>as it stands at present and examining it to see whether we really do still need all the things we have enacted over the past decades or whether a considerable degree of simplification is possible in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Europe possesses vast and virtually unused potential in terms of economic performance; it is there, before our very eyes, we often talk about it, and yet little is done about it. I am talking about the 25 million small and medium-sized businesses in Europe, which provide two-thirds of our total workforce. Let us not be content with telling those 25 million that they are the backbone of the European economy, and then do nothing beyond that. Instead, we need a policy that makes use of the sector’s enormous potential in terms of innovation, investment capacity, and creativity, and turns it into jobs. I will shortly be putting before you proposals for the comprehensive modernisation and upgrading – I stress ‘upgrading’ – of Europe’s policy on small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is industrial policy; the word itself calls forth fear in some Member States. We need a modern definition of industrial policy for the twenty-first century. It can no longer be what it was in the past, with protective fences being put up around certain industries; here, too, the only thing to do is to maintain competitiveness and enhance it, but we need to be aware that Europe needs a strong and long-term industrial base, and so it will be necessary to consider European industry sector by sector and to discuss with all the stakeholders – companies, trade unions, legislatures and governments – which framework conditions are the best for the sector under consideration, enabling it to make the maximum use of its potential for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The last topic I want to mention is that of innovation. Here, too, the Commission will be coming up with new and far-reaching proposals. Innovation is the link in the chain between research, development and production, and it is where Europe is not strong enough. We need to improve our capacity for turning what comes out of research into innovation, and to do so everywhere. The Americans, among others, are much better at it.</p>
<p class="contents">The present Commission is firmly convinced that Europe is strong enough to face up to the challenges of global competition. In almost every sector of the economy, there is at least one European company or country that leads the world. To put it another way, we can do it. We can learn from one another. We can support each other making use of the potential that exists in our societies, but we will need to give the European institutions the capacities to implement a policy along these lines, and so, before I conclude my speech, I cannot do other than observe that growth and employment policy is a powerful instrument for achieving these long-term policy goals of ours, but the figures in the next Financial Perspective must reflect it. I think the only thing I can say on this is that it would do serious damage to the success of our growth and employment policy if the uncertainty about the next Financial Perspective were to persist for some time. As a matter of urgency, I appeal to the Member States to take to heart the fact that great projects need time for preparation. Time is not on our side. It is also an issue of Europe’s credibility in the eyes of the public; we must be prepared to demonstrate that what we say will be backed up by what we do. It is also a fact that action costs money – there is nothing I can do about that. Without a Budget that produces the goods, without a clear Financial Perspective, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve what we aim to do.</p>

While extending thanks to the chairman of the steering committee, Mr Daul, and our group’s coordinator, Mrs Thyssen, whose work has been outstanding, I also would like to thank those, not all of whom I can name, have played their part in enabling us – it is to be hoped – to get a broad majority in a good cause when we vote at midday.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission – whose President and Vice-President we welcome here today – has set the right priorities for its five-year term of office: growth and employment. Our group is very definitely behind them in this, and we are also glad to see the Commission represented here not only by such important members, but also in such numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake is the European Union’s ability to compete. Let us just look at a few figures and compare ourselves with our main competitors, our partners and friends in the United States. If we take the standard in the fifteen-Member State EU as 100, the enlargement to 25 Member States reduced our productivity per worker to 93, while work productivity in the USA stands at 121. That shows the competitive advantage that the United States of America enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">In itself, the fact that our people are living longer is very much cause for rejoicing, but it is one of the great challenges we face, in that the question arises of how we make use of older people’s experience. In the Europe of 25, the employment rate stands at 40%, while it is 59.9% in the United States. Ought we not to be giving thought to how to enhance older people’s potential and experience, and improve their work opportunities? If we turn to research and development, we see that the European Union’s 25 Member States spend 1.9% of GNP on it, as against the USA’s 2.8%. It is clear from that what a massive effort we have to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group very much welcomes the substance of two amendments that speak of the need for us to strengthen the spirit of entrepreneurship. Vice-President Verheugen was right to stress the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, the need for us to create a culture of risk-taking, the need for us to encourage personal initiative and personal responsibility, and, above all, for economic legislation that is unbureaucratic and that businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, can comprehend, with a simple and fair tax system and the predictability that we need in economic policy. What that means is that we have to make it possible for those who work in business to have confidence in those who hold political office.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that we should develop a growth-oriented macro-economic environment, that we should have a stable currency and dynamic development in our economy and labour market, and that we should reduce state debt. I cannot therefore do other than encourage all the actors to reform the Stability Pact in such a way that – assuming they succeed in this – the Pact ends up being at the heart of our shared efforts. What we need is reform, flexibility, the acceptance of responsibility, less red tape, and if we succeed in all these things, that will also facilitate solidarity – in the shape of a very rational and far-sighted social policy – with those people in our community, in our Member States, who are in need of it.</p>
<p class="contents">What we demand of the Member States is that they should make their contribution to a Europe that is capable of development and that fosters growth, a Europe with a growing economy. That is not, however, an end in itself; rather, the object is the creation of jobs, enabling people to get involved and make use of their options in Europe. Such is now our common task.</p>

I also share the view – taken not only by the Commission, but also by all the European institutions and all the Member States of the European Union – that the project is complete in itself, and that, in order for it to succeed, all alike must play their parts in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to join in thanking the members of the ad hoc committee – my colleagues Mr Désir and Mr Goebbels, as well as Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne – and of my own group, for all of them did very intensive work and made a very constructive contribution to the broad and consensual text that we have before us today. We spent a long time discussing what we should emphasise when talking about the achievement of the Lisbon goals. What I hear said today echoes in a positive way the messages we sent out from our debate. I agree that Lisbon will fail if people come to feel that it aims to recast the European social model, and if possible to downgrade it, but if, as a project, it enhances Europe’s prosperity by making it a more competitive continent, while at the same time maintaining the social framework conditions that can make it possible for every person in this Union to live decently, by creating jobs and social security for young and old: if that is what Lisbon leads them to feel, then it is a project that the people will accept.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is on that that its success depends – on whether a project gains popular acceptance or not. For forty or fifty years, the whole point of the European Union was that it kept the peace in Europe, achieving a balance between the poor and the rich, bringing a divided continent together and overcoming division. All these things we have achieved. For as long as it was a success, the people regarded Europe as their project, but that period of history is coming to its end and people are asking more and more what the point of Europe is. For more and more of them, this is a very personal question. People want to know, not only about Europe’s values, but also about the European Union’s economic benefits, and the European Union is of economic benefit in that, being an integrated Europe and an internal market with the capacity to unleash its own economic and social power, it is this continent’s organised answer to the challenge of globalisation; making social and economic sense of it is precisely what the Lisbon strategy is about, and that is what made it a good start and a good decision. The fact that we have been engaged in this process for a number of years now, and are not satisfied, must not prompt us to give up; instead we must muster our courage and press on. I think the text we will be adopting today shows that a broad majority in this House will join the other institutions – the Commission and, I hope, the Council, as well as the individual Member States – in their efforts, for what both Commissioner Verheugen and the President of the Commission have said today is crucial: it is not we alone, nor the institutions of the EU alone, but, above all, the Member States must pull their weight. I am very much in agreement with Commissioner Verheugen’s view, and would like to make that clear on behalf of my group. I was also delighted to see the President of the Commission smile with pleasure when Commissioner Verheugen pointed out the connection between the Financial Perspective and the Lisbon process. If this project is going to succeed, it will not do so on the basis of ever more tasks with ever fewer financial resources; that will not work.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause</span></p>
<p class="contents">Those who want this project to succeed while leaving the resources unchanged must not be left without an answer when they want to reallocate them for the benefit of the Lisbon goals. People may say that we are capping; fair enough, but if an upper limit is imposed when no more money is available, a qualitative decision will have to be taken as to which investments under the Lisbon strategy will have to be stopped, and to the detriment of which other tasks. So far, the Council and the Member States have maintained a dignified silence as to what these might be, but, at some point, they will have to be put to the test. I expect from the Commission the sort of commitment we have heard today from Commissioner Verheugen and from the President of the Commission. Let the Heads of State or Government be told that the point of the Financial Perspective must be none other than to help achieve the Lisbon objectives, where these are taken seriously. This connection is, in our view, important, as are their three points: better regulation, the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises and a pro-active industrial policy to secure both industrial jobs and the environmental standards and quality of our products, thereby making us better able to compete in export markets. Yes, we, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, are all in favour of that, for all these things, above all else, create one thing, and that is work, which, in its turn, creates social security. That, for us, is the starting point. I am grateful to all those on the ad hoc committee who helped to bring about a broad majority in this House on this crucial issue. As we see it, one thing is clear: if this House adopts resolutions that bear the stamp of the Right, the Left will have no part in them. If this House adopts resolutions reflecting what we Social Democrats think, then they will enjoy our support.</p>

The Council presidency’s plea this morning for somebody in each Member State to take responsibility is well judged. Moreover, President Barroso, you will need political will in the Council and support in this House for your reforms, neither of which is yet fully evident. Europe’s right-wing parties have still not yet embraced the central fact of globalisation that the nation-state and the free market are no longer compatible. Free movement of goods and capital without similarly free movement of services and labour is economic nonsense. And the left is still riven by dissent over the role of the state in managing the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, Europe’s Liberals and Democrats will remain steadfast and united in support of your agenda, provided you recognise that the forces which spur growth and create new jobs lie in entrepreneurship and in the determination to make a great product or provide a great new service. The real competition in the global economy is to attract investment capital to back new ideas and create new jobs. Unless the single market can be made to work properly, we will lose that battle.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats do not deny that government has a role in economic management. When a better educated, wealthier, more assertive public has developed ethical concerns and a higher sensitivity to risk, and when companies value intangible assets like corporate reputation, there is a demand for active and responsible government. For that reason we welcome your REACH proposals, for example, or a commitment to bringing aircraft emissions into the emissions trading system.</p>
<p class="contents">Government too has a role in protecting citizens from fraud or market failure and levelling the playing field not only between businesses, but also between business and the citizen. That is why my Group supported the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in the last mandate and will support proposals for greater legal certainty in cross-border transactions in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">To us, getting the balance of economic policy right seems fundamental. We therefore have serious reservations about, for example, a poorly prepared software patents directive, which seems of more benefit to multinationals than to smaller inventors. Greater intellectual rigour needs to be applied if Mr McCreevy’s proposal is to secure a majority at second reading. Patents should protect innovation, rather than stifle competition. Without a coherent intellectual property regime across the European Union, we will create few new European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a single market in services must be the centrepiece of the Lisbon Agenda, to provide growth and jobs. But Liberals and Democrats recognise a big difference between the functioning of a market and the discharge of a public service, and the Services Directive will need some changes to reflect that.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, you recognise that if Europe’s growth rates continue to lag, we will not provide the same degree of security, prosperity and opportunity for our citizens as others enjoy. We will support your efforts to kick-start Europe’s economy but we are not blind to the weakness of measuring economic progress only in quantitative terms. For example, cars that are safer, more fuel efficient and easier to dismantle after use reduce economic growth in classical terms but create another type of good. We will expect your Commission to be open to such ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">To improve the economic vitality and the social and environmental health of our continent simultaneously, the Lisbon Agenda must combine flexibility, fairness and farsightedness. If it does, the Burghers of Lisbon will be proud to have lent their name to Europe’s success. Just as Henry the Navigator guided Europe’s pioneers in the discovery of new lands and great wealth, so you can guide us in the discovery of similar economic success.</p>

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we do not feel that that is enough, at least in its current form, for us to take part in the political compromise that is taking shape. We are obviously pleased that some of our proposals have been included in the joint resolution, but we believe there are still gaps in the text. It lacks a clear choice as to the instruments that we should have at our disposal to achieve our goals, and it lacks guarantees that the Commission – and Parliament as well – will be willing and able to stand up to those who do not believe in the need for European control of the economy and are pressing for renationalisation of the cohesion policies, a backward reform of the labour market and a further cut in the Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the concern to reach a compromise, contradictory elements have been included in the resolution, leaving the message confused instead of more convincing. We have picked out a number of incongruities in the text. It is a fact that nobody likes paying taxes, but we do not share the aim of indiscriminately cutting taxes to a minimum, because that would only lead to greater social inequalities. Europe needs a tax reform that reduces labour costs and taxes other sectors. Jacques Delors said as much very many years ago, but nothing has been done since then and instead the subject has dropped out of the European debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the resolution retains a remarkably moderate and even ambiguous stance on three extremely important topics, which are going to be the subject of some hard legislative wrangling over the coming months; they are the services directive, the REACH regulation and the software patents directive. The outcome of the wrangling will show whether the Lisbon Strategy is just a return to old Thatcherite formulas or the beginning of a genuine New Deal for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr McCreevy, we think that the Bolkestein directive should be withdrawn so that we can start off again on the right foot, in other words with a directive on services of public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen, we believe that the REACH regulation in its current form is already just enough of a compromise between the undoubtedly important arguments of industry and the priorities of health and the environment. It is a compromise that the Commission and Parliament too should defend tooth and nail against the aggressive lobbying of the chemical industry, which does not understand that organising an efficient and credible control system is the best way to ensure its competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think that coming out explicitly against the patentability of software means affirming that innovation ‘made in Europe’ is fostered through the freedom and dissemination of knowledge and not by protecting the large multinationals and their monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a basic ambiguity hangs over this text in relation to the true added value of the Union compared with action taken by national governments. In our view, such added value derives from the ability to invest in instruments for growth, which cannot be reduced just to GDP percentages, and in sectors that are not strictly tangible, such as education and culture. That is done by making use of renewable resources and sustainable solutions and gradually abandoning sectors that use up and waste resources, such as major infrastructure works and intensive agriculture, and those that create major health and environmental risks, such as nuclear energy, GM organisms and harmful chemical products.</p>

Their decisive objective of moving towards full employment by 2010 gave rise, here and there, to real hopes.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years later, the situation is a cruel disappointment. Unemployment remains, on average, about 9% in Europe, where lack of job security is increasing rapidly. In the Union’s premier economy, that of Germany, which holds the absolute record for exports, unemployment has nevertheless exceeded the five-million mark. In order to achieve the Lisbon objective, that is to say a 70% employment rate by 2010, it would be necessary to create 22 million more jobs than the present rate over the next five years. This is hard to imagine at a time when the European Central Bank has just revised its growth forecast for the euro zone, reducing it to 1.6% for this year, and when countries such as Italy and the Netherlands are on the verge of recession.</p>
<p class="contents">However, things are not going badly for everybody. <span class="italic">The Economist </span>observes that there has been an explosion in the profits of the big companies. Their share in the GDP of Europe and of Asia, as the British journal points out, has achieved a level which is without precedent in the last 25 years. The workers, it explains, are the major losers. Yet who is talking about the workers here?</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the organisation ATD Fourth World regrets the fact that nowhere in its communication of 2 February does the Commission mention the objective of eliminating poverty, which currently affects 68 million people in the Union. Do you not think that such a radical separation between the objectives announced yesterday and the results obtained today justifies our asking some serious questions about the relevance of the liberal dogmas which have served, from the start, as the basis for the Lisbon process? <span class="italic">Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet what are the messages from Brussels which our fellow citizens are hearing day after day? Mrs Danuta Hübner, Commissioner for Regional Policy, wants to facilitate delocalisations in Europe. For Mr Špidla, Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, our objective is, above all, flexibility. The Vice-President responsible for industry, Mr Verheugen, hits the nail on the head in the French press, when he says that, with the Lisbon strategy, there were so many priorities that there were none, and that this time we want an action plan which is specific and which concentrates on competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">For her part, Mrs Nellie Kroes, Commissioner for Competition, has declared that she wants to do away with State aids of a regional nature in the 15 older Member States of the Union. As for Mr Mandelson, Commissioner for Trade, he has reminded Member States of their duty to continue to reform their labour markets and their welfare systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr McCreevy, the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, deserves special mention. He brought to an end the long-running saga on the withdrawal, revision or retention of the Bolkestein Directive, explaining that there is no question of withdrawing this text, despite the fact that it had been rejected on all sides. He immediately followed that by refusing, in collaboration with the Council, to re-examine the directive on software patenting, despite the fact that this had been unanimously demanded by the parliamentary groups. Finally, at the European Policy Forum in London, he revealed his true opinion, with Anglo-Saxon bluntness, by saying, and I quote Mr McCreevy, </p>
<p class="contents">‘We should remember that the internal market programme is by far the greatest deregulatory exercise in recent history.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>This is what Mr Barroso calls ‘a new focus on growth and jobs’. Do you not sense, therefore, that people feel that they are moving irresistibly closer to the liberalism-overdose threshold, and that the rejection of this model will, sooner or later, return like a boomerang to rebound on the Union’s governing bodies in one form or another? My group is campaigning precisely in order to help this opinion to be expressed, not against Europe – and there is a danger of that happening – but in favour of its profound transformation. That is why we obviously cannot give our backing to the compromise resolution which has been tabled today, and that is why we have submitted an alternative version.</p>

EU projects may, then, reduce the need for state appropriations to the individual Member States. Increased EU funding need not, therefore, result in an increased tax burden.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of large projects such as space initiatives and those involving nuclear power, there may be economies of scale to be gained from carrying on projects at EU level. Otherwise I believe that the Lisbon Process should primarily be funded by the Member States themselves. The Lisbon Process must not be allowed to become the jumping-off point for a large number of new projects at EU level that require funding by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I think that the issue of whether national initiatives can be replaced by EU projects is an important one. I wonder whether there is any empirical evidence of the existence of synergistic effects. My experience tends to suggest the opposite: the more the EU invests in expanding its bureaucracy and the more legislation and directives it adopts, the more the public sector in the Member States grows. For each new official in Brussels, the total number of officials in the Member States increases by a factor of five, ten or twenty-five.</p>
<p class="contents">According to what is known as public choice theory, it is to be expected that each national bureaucracy will seek to maximise its influence and role. The more the EU takes over power from the bureaucracies in the Member States, the more these bureaucracies expand. There are many reasons for this. The new directives have to be implemented, monitoring must be tightened up. Moreover, the politicians who have lost their right of initiative seek out new areas in which to act and tell us that more resources are needed in order to strengthen their negotiating position in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example of this, we only need to look at what happened on the launch of the euro. As the national central banks lost their real function – that of conducting monetary policy – the number of their service staff increased substantially. This same phenomenon can be observed in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission should take the initiative and allow independent researchers, economists and political scientists to study the operation of the bureaucratic multiplier within the EU. It is important to stop this process, and one of the ways of doing this is by having fewer legislative directives and more voluntary agreements. If this is not done, it is likely that the biggest growth sector will prove to be public bureaucracy. Through our ambitions to harmonise, legislate and become involved in every conceivable issue, we run the risk of putting a brake on growth. The EU should, therefore, instead make more use of the institutional competition that resides in diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We live in a globalised market economy, which only appears to support free competition. A prerequisite for free competition, in fact, is starting off on the same footing, or at least on a comparable footing, based on negotiated trade-offs. That prerequisite does not exist in practice, just as there is also no mobility policy in the various sectors that might help to revitalise competitiveness and hence employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Politics, finance and the economy have to find new rules for running the system imposed by the global market, to replace the rules that governed the market before globalisation. Europe’s institutions must be short-sighted and unable to grasp the consequences of globalised information over the Internet if they still believe that getting together and announcing a series of intentions is enough to make them actually materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not sufficient to make long-term plans which are handed down from on high. History shows that during the last century a great power’s economy collapsed under the weight of reality because of centralised plans that were splendid only in theory. Reality does not depend on plans; on the contrary, plans have to take account of reality. At this stage in our society it cannot be enough to have an economy still based exclusively on unbridled consumerism.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Lisbon European Council, when the knowledge-based society was first defined, a few issues were overlooked, such as making rules to ensure that knowledge is genuine and not manipulated or used for illicit ends. In addition, the Lisbon strategy will not be able to take off if the Union’s objectives do not include identifying and implementing measures to provide developing countries with effective help, leading them to democracy and respect for human rights and the rights of workers and children. It is essential to think in terms of social economics in parallel with development economics.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this aim, Europe has to change its relations with those countries where workers do not enjoy social security or legal protection and where children cannot play but are forced to work. Environmental protection and the creation of a European social model are goals that must be pursued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential to establish sources of funding that make it possible to achieve these goals, yet at the same time it is crucial that the cost of living be as low as possible. Cheap services and products are particularly important for the poorest groups in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Developments in research allowing wider access to modern technologies, and production methods enabling us to compete with countries outside the EU, are examples of ways in which it will be possible to achieve the Lisbon goals. Priority should also be given to the effective implementation of modern production methods thanks to which jobs can be created that are both modern and secure. Modern, cheap and high-quality production makes it possible to compete on external markets, which in practice then results in new jobs in the production and services sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of the Lisbon strategy entails the analysis of a number of areas of activity involving both the European Union and its Member States. One of the main problems we face as far as the Lisbon strategy is concerned is ensuring that the appropriateness of the goals set for research and for implementation programmes. The current system for laying down guidelines on research and for channelling funds towards individual research projects is heavily exploited by those Member States that are largest in economic terms. Over the past few decades, leading research and development centres have been established in Europe, for example in Finland or Saxony. Over the next five years, a great many new centres of this kind should be set up, in order to close the gap between the EU and the global leaders in this field. We must increase expenditure on research to at least 3% of GDP, as well as employing at least one million more people in science and research and putting in place procedures to guarantee funds are spent effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Major organisational changes must be made to the present set-up in order to ensure the cohesion of measures. For example, an appropriate number of research centres should be established in accordance with planned developments in technology and production, with the aim of bringing together local research units. The latter should be established in order to exploit the intellectual potential of countries that could not afford to build modern research facilities, and therefore to carry out research on their own. In addition to research, both the local units and the research centres should carry out teaching and take on talented young PhD students, thus creating a new cadre of researchers. An action plan of this kind would help to fill the gap left by those researchers who have been poached by countries outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary aim of science and technology as a whole should be to promote small and medium-sized enterprises. The development of the latter would eliminate unemployment, yet they cannot afford to carry out research or to implement progressive and modern production methods. Three programmes should be set up relating to research, the employment of researchers and the cohesion of such measures in the EU Member States. These should comprise a programme laying down guidelines for regional development and the specialisation of production in European countries, a programme aimed at setting up a European system for research and the training of researchers, plus a programme designed to provide information, facilitate the introduction of new technologies and products and ensure that they are applied in production. The aim of these programmes should be to reduce any negative economic impact caused by the planned introduction of the REACH programme to a minimum. The system according to which research measures are carried out ought to be simple, easy-to-understand and based on the principle of competitiveness, which will ensure it is effective and encourage investment by the private sector. In order to gain public and political support, the system must promote cohesion …</p>

This is impossible without economic growth or jobs. We must achieve these with an ageing population and against the background of the aggressive globalisation of the economy. In order to succeed, we need insight and vision, but also the right decisions, which, above all, we need to carry out. A European stick behind national doors in the shape of a new form of governance will certainly prove useful.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the fact that the Barroso Commission has taken the brave decision to revive and breathe new life into the Lisbon strategy and, on the recommendation of the Kok working party, has opted to give priority to growth and jobs in a balanced social and ecological context. It testifies to honesty and is also in keeping with our approach of a citizens’ Europe founded upon values.</p>
<p class="contents">We have given our wholehearted support to the steering committee’s recommendation, and to that made by the Conference of Presidents, and indeed, although the formulation is general, it is up to the Member States to make specific choices. We will indicate the way and have made our basic position quite clear. We must opt in favour of competitiveness, a positive business climate – definitely also including SMEs – and economic growth and jobs. The three initiatives announced by the Commission will certainly have a place in those.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide the means in order to achieve these ends. The Member States must plan and deliver. We will encourage the national parliaments to galvanise their governments into action. Reforms need to be carried out now in order to allow for sustainable development in all respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, all of us, including all institutions and all social partners at European, local and national level, must all do our level best. I am therefore pleased to find out that the Socialist Group in this House takes a positive view of the resolution.

I am also pleased to have heard already, in the remarks of the President and the Vice-President of the Commission, an echo of what our resolution expresses.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years the European Union has acquired a currency of its own, has been enlarged, and has adopted a draft Constitution; in other words, broadly speaking, it has established its framework. Now, however, the substance of its policies does not match up to its citizens’ expectations. That is why it has to concentrate on growth, on employment, on social and territorial cohesion, not only because these are the very objectives of this process of building Europe – now that peace is assured – but also because they are the prerequisites for the public’s support for the political plans for the construction of Europe, as Mr Martin Schulz has reminded us. That is why we believe that it is important to state that the Lisbon strategy must be the Union’s priority over the next five years. We believe that this strategy is the right one, provided that it is taken seriously, in other words provided that it is effectively implemented in the Member States in the three dimensions defined at the 2000 Summit under the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective must be to put our money on European competitiveness and growth, by basing them on the elements of the European model and not – as we sometimes have the impression that you are doing, Mr President, when you mention your three threads – by setting one of those three threads against the other two. We think that we can only properly serve the interests of economic competitiveness by looking after the social and environmental aspects equally well.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that Europe has a future as a low-cost competitor. I am delighted to hear you mention the need to put our money on excellence, high-quality training for the labour force, human capital, research, and the quality of infrastructures and public services. These are advantages which will ensure that investors back the European Union. It is because the European Union’s products will be based to a greater extent on technology, know-how and eco-innovation that they will find their place in the world markets. It is because we are relaunching growth on that basis that we shall have the resources to finance effectively a high level of training, distribution and social cohesion within the Union and in particular the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a battle to be fought, and clarifications to be made. In fact – and I welcome the fact that in this Parliament, essentially, by means of our motion for a resolution, we have managed to avoid these pitfalls – there are a certain number of people who would like to see the Lisbon strategy reduced to a sort of magic formula, a programme of wholesale liberalisation: liberalisation of the services market, liberalisation of the employment market, and liberalisation of pension schemes, as if that was enough in itself to ensure the relaunching of European growth and of competitiveness. In my view, not only is that rather limited, but it is also completely beside the point.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs reforms, and we are all agreed on that. It needs to adapt and to have a more dynamic economy, but it also needs investment, it needs to restimulate internal demand, and it needs to coordinate its efforts and to concentrate them on what can, in future, constitute its wealth and its opportunity in international competition. That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on a financial perspective which is consistent with the Lisbon strategy, in other words the doubling of the European research budget and constant effort as regards the major trans-European networks, social cohesion and regional policy. That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on an ambitious social agenda which must be integrated into this overall strategy, and on the fact that the road map which you have presented to us – the legislative and budgetary action plan – must relate to the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we have the feeling that there is still a lack of balance, that most of the specific proposals concentrate on competitiveness, the economy and structural reforms, and that there is a lack of incentives, information and legislative initiatives in the area of social cohesion and on environmental issues. For example, we now want to see a real draft framework directive on services of general interest. We would like to see a reform of the European Works Councils, in order to enable us to say that the quality of employer-employee relations in Europe is part of our development strategy. In the area of eco-innovations, we should like to see more specific initiatives, and we are pleased to note that, finally, industrial policy linked to innovation and aid for small and medium-sized enterprises has been included in the Commission’s programme.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the essence of the message which will be expressed by the European Parliament. I am delighted that we have achieved very broad agreement once again thanks to the work of Mr Daul, Mr Lehne and Mrs Thyssen. I am sorry that a certain number of other groups on the Left feel unable to join us, on the basis of the content of this resolution. I can understand that there are still differences, but I can quite honestly say that I believe we have managed to come up with a clear, strong message which is in line with a Lisbon strategy which contributes to the European social model.</p>

This new start should not, however, follow the line of the Commission proposal. I am not critical about what is contained in the proposal, but rather what is not in the proposal. Separating economic growth from social and environmental development must be a mistake since these three areas are linked.</p>
<p class="contents">When President Barroso presented the mid-term review in this Parliament more than a month ago he used the metaphor of having three children and having to pay most attention to the sick one. The other two, in this case environmental and social development, will have to await their turn for President Barroso’s attention. My conclusion is the opposite. To cure the EU economy we need the health of the whole family.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment in environmental technology leads to more jobs, boosts innovation and creates sustainable growth. When the forestry and pulp industry in the Nordic countries made a major shift towards cleaner green technology, the companies concerned became even more competitive on the international market. New technologies for saving energy are another example of business interests being in tune with environmental concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a saying that competition brings out the best in products and the worst in people. This is definitely true of business, and it is important to create an internal market that is a level playing field. We need to create a competitive and sustainable economy in Europe; this also means investing in research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State must take the situation seriously. We can set up ambitious goals, but if we lack the necessary political leadership we will never reach them. In Europe we look at the situation in the US and wonder why it has double the growth that we have. The US wonders why China has twice the growth it has.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a great potential to be the world’s leading knowledge-based economy. The proposals from the Commission are good, but to reduce the Lisbon Strategy only to a matter of economic growth would be to take steps in the wrong direction while time is running out.</p>
<p class="contents">The major groups have negotiated this resolution and the clear message is that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental development have to be seen as a whole. We demand the same from the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank my fellow negotiators because it is a major achievement to table this resolution – I almost said revolution! – and to have a large majority in the Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have made clear in our amendments, there must be no blank cheque for Mr Bolkestein. Until such time as the Commission – and here I am also appealing to the Members of this House – withdraws the proposal, it can veto a progressive vote at first reading stage, and we are weakening ourselves and making this House to some extent ridiculous if we do not right now insist on the Commission withdrawing this proposal and thus enabling this House to know on what basis our debates are being conducted. This we have set out in our second amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
