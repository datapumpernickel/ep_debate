<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I understand Members’ concerns that the biotechnology directive should be applied correctly. This is important, not just for all those in industry who use patents to support the introduction of new products and processes, but also those who benefit from the availability of the results of research and development. These could be researchers, industrial competitors, patients and medical staff and those who administer health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnology covers a wide range of powerful and sometimes controversial technologies. They can make a vital contribution to the long-term future of industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, agriculture, energy, textiles and chemicals. Biotechnology also creates new opportunities and prospects for developing life-saving drugs and treating diseases. It offers enormous potential for massively improving the quality of life of many citizens. But success in developing biotechnology also depends on finding solutions to the significant ethical, societal, economic and environmental issues it throws up.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 98/44/EC establishes well-balanced principles for the protection of biotechnological inventions through patents. It also takes into account the ethical aspects of this sensitive subject, as well as the legitimate desire of industry and others to establish a clear and effective scope for patent protection in this area of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall that the purpose of the directive is to establish the legal framework for granting patents, which covers the results of research. It does not in any way replace regulations that govern research in particular areas, including certain ethical rules such as those on human integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to follow the application of the directive in practice very carefully, with due regard to ethical, moral and cultural considerations, and will not fail to inform the European Parliament, as it has so far done, in the framework of the evaluation reports envisaged in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the particular areas identified by Parliament in the motion for a resolution, I make the following remarks. On purpose-bound protection, the issue is whether patents on gene sequences – DNA sequences – should be allowed according to the classical model of patent claim whereby a first inventor can claim an invention that covers possible future uses of that sequence. Or should the patent be restricted so that only the specific use disclosed in the patent application can be claimed, which is purpose-bound protection?</p>
<p class="contents">On examination of the technical provisions of the directive, it can be seen that none of these articles explicitly addresses the concept of a restricted scope of protection relating to the specific use identified for the gene sequence concerned. That might be seen as arguing for the usual broad scope of protection rather than a restricted one, since that has always been the traditional approach in patent law.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it might be thought that the Community legislator had intended at least to raise the possibility of a limited scope of protection, covering only the specific industrial application identified in the patent as far as this particular type of invention is concerned. That restrictive interpretation should not be incompatible with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will now, in consultation with those involved, consider the consequences of allowing both interpretations of the directive and the best way to achieve a correct application of the directive on human cloning. The directive is clear for the Commission as regards the issue of patentability of reproductive cloning involving the creation of new human beings, which is clearly excluded under Article 6 of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The term ‘therapeutic cloning’ covers a wide range of different possibilities. Research may be permitted in some Member States and not in others. For the Commission, the use of human pluripotent stem cells to cure diseases is not necessarily excluded from patentability. In light of those arguments, a modification of the directive does not, at this stage, seem appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to recall that biotechnology has enormous potential for good, particularly in medical fields, and patent protection is of great importance to key industrial sectors, which invest heavily in research and development costs. We are working in the context of a global economy, which means our industry and researchers are competing with those in the United States and growing markets such as Asia. Indeed, according to recent reports Chinese companies filed more biotechnology patents in Europe in certain sectors last year than European companies did. As I have said, I understand the concerns that some Members have raised and I shall listen with interest to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peter Liese, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the topic with which we are concerned here this evening is a sensitive one. Even before the adoption of Directive 98/44/EC, there was a very controversial discussion on this issue, for which some fellow Members were present. There are several front lines, and there are some who are generally opposed to biotechnology. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is not among them. Biotechnology is necessary; it must be used to solve many of our problems.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who are generally opposed to patents. The PPE-DE Group considers that stance, too, quite wrong. Patents constitute an incentive for innovation, and designing these properly helps us make headway. There are some who are generally opposed to the Directive on the grounds that it opens up many possibilities that conjure up terrible images for them; but I believe that the Directive is better than it is made out to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Back then, following long discussions, it was clearly stipulated that not everything that can be patented may be patented in the European Union. This is the argument I have used to defend the Directive against criticism from many quarters again and again in recent years. We must also ensure that the Directive is applied, however, and in addition we must speak up whenever we have the impression that there has been an infringement of this Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In February of this year, the European Patent Office issued a patent that, among other things, regards even parts of the human body, namely human sperm cells, as a patentable invention. This is incorrect in accordance with the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have studied this patent several times and also consulted with patent agents. It is indeed an infringement of the Directive. Human sperm cells are being patented. If we become aware of an infringement of this nature, we must question it from a political point of view. Parliament’s Legal Service has informed us that Parliament itself cannot raise an objection, but others can, and should, in order to resolve this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive must be applied, and therefore so, too, must Article 6(2). This Article states that techniques involving the destruction of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes are unpatentable. Whether or not one disagrees on this issue on ethical grounds, the Directive is relatively unambiguous on the subject, and that must be pushed through.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the current state of the art, human embryonic stem cells cannot be produced without destroying human embryos. Regardless of whether or not one considers this ethically acceptable, my view and that of the PPE-DE Group is that it follows that human embryonic stem cells cannot be patented. The objection could be raised that more recent scientific developments have taken place. These only relate to experiments in mice, however, and it took almost 20 years for research on embryonic stem cells of mice to progress to humans. The 1998 invention by Thomson of methods for producing human embryonic stem cells came almost 20 years later than a similar invention with regard to mice.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in my interpretation and in the opinion of many experts, the science published two weeks ago amounts to no other than the cloning of human embryos. That is most definitely excluded. I would ask the Commissioner once more to examine the matter carefully. I had not planned to criticise the Commission this evening, but the Commissioner is guilty of a misinterpretation. I would invite him to read the Council’s explanatory memorandum, and also the joint resolution: these regulate the issue of cloning unequivocally.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one issue on which the Directive is not clear, and that is on the patentability of human DNA. We would therefore ask the Commission to clarify this. Apart from that, the Directive is good, and we should defend it.</p>

I am talking in particular of the report submitted by the Commission pursuant to Article 16 of the Biotechnology Patents Directive. On behalf of my group, I can state that we agree with the conclusions of this report both on the issue of the area of application – the scope of patents – and on the distinction drawn between the patentability of totipotent and pluripotent stem cells, and that we can also support the report’s proposals on how to proceed. For we, too, want to promote the development of biotechnology and are convinced that patents play a very important part in this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I believe that the present written report by the Commission does not go far enough, and that there are more unresolved problems with the application of our Biotechnology Patents Directive than the Commission actually addresses in its report. I am now a fairly long-standing Member of this House, and participated actively in taking the decision at that time. Of course, once again we are all victims here of the compromises that had to be entered into back then. I should also like to see the Commission adopting a somewhat faster approach and addressing the remaining unresolved problems more directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Less a problem with the Commission and more a problem with several Members of this House is the issue, arising from this motion for a resolution, of whether the European Parliament should act as a complainant. As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can only advise against taking such a step. It is not Parliament’s job to participate in individual proceedings. I hope that we can adopt a resolution tomorrow that does not entail that.</p>

I echo the thoughts of the previous speaker in thanking him for a balanced and considered report. That is perhaps in stark contrast – as our group wanted to say – to the way in which this House has had to deal with this resolution. I believe that we all wanted to have an exchange of views with you tonight, but to be bounced into a resolution was perhaps not the way to answer a considered report. For five people in a room until midnight last night to be trying to think up a resolution is not the way to deal with this sensitive and difficult issue. If Parliament looks at this issue again, it should do so with a proper parliamentary report, developed in the fullness of time through a committee and with mature debate, not in the way that this has been produced.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that some colleagues would wish to revisit the directive by way of a resolution concocted over 24 hours. Clearly we have to do that with much more time and better thought. As for the idea of a legal action, it was quite clear last night that Parliament’s Legal Service considers that we have neither the status nor the right to take such action. Our group has taken the view that we should seek at present to maintain the status quo, welcome the report and wait for the proper time to give this very delicate issue the proper space it deserves for full debate and consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The designer patent is scandalous. It is most definitely illegal, clearly contravenes the Patent Directive and signifies the commercialisation of human breeding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Patent Directive clearly excludes the patenting of germ line cells. Even sex-selection techniques are prohibited in almost all Member States. This patent thus opens the way for designer humans, for custom-made human beings. It is unacceptable for the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to stand by and do nothing while this violation of the EU Patent Directive takes place. Neither Parliament nor the Commission can stand by and do nothing while patents are granted for human breeding. This is no invention, by the way; it is at most a discovery, and it, too, quite clearly contravenes the Patent Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to take up a clear position. The Commission is burying its head in the sand in the face of the inconsistencies and errors in the text of the Directive. It is remaining inactive out of fear of the urgently needed revision of the Directive. In its report and also here today, the Commission has unambiguously admitted that the harmonisation of patent law on biotechnology is no longer a given, as some Member States impose very clear limits on the multifunctionality of genes.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does the Commission venture any clarification on the issue of the patentability of embryonic stem cells. If it excludes human embryos – and thus parts of a human being – from patentability, it is not following the Council’s interpretation. The Commission President has actually been called on to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also disappointed that the Commissioner did not devote a single word to the patents granted wholesale for seeds, plants and animals, nor to infringements of the Directive, for example the failure to investigate the suffering of animals. These are clear omissions on the part of the Commission. We would call on the Commission to advance beyond mere monitoring and finally take some action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That bodes well for the future. That is exactly what we have done, and we have come to the conclusion that it is our firm belief that the human body and all of its parts are not patentable, since their functioning is not a human invention, but rather a discovery, and, as such, not patentable. This applies just as much to embryos, stem cells, germ cells and the genome, on which we cannot claim right of ownership.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, in the second 16C report, the Commission is right to state that the totipotent stem cells are not patentable, it remains vague about the patentability of pluripotent stem cells. These are also parts of the human body and are, in accordance with Article 5 (1) of the directive, excluded from patents.</p>
<p class="contents">The patent that has fuelled this debate concerns human gametes. The fact that this patent has been granted flies in the face of the principle that the human body and the parts thereof are not patentable. It would be preferable if the groups were able to spell this out more clearly and unequivocally, particularly in the common resolution. Parliament should take its monitoring task seriously. This means lodging a firm objection with the European Patent Office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One aspect of biotechnology research that raises particular concerns and questions is something that many of us, myself most certainly included, believe must be banned entirely. I refer to cloning of any kind, including therapeutic cloning and all research into human engineering or that resulting in the destruction of embryos. My reason for opposing such research is that I regard it as nothing other than the destruction of a human being, and this view is shared by a great many Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we should approach this issue with the utmost sensitivity. Quite apart from moral considerations, there are at least three reasons why we should do so. The first of these is common human decency. The second is the principle of subsidiarity, since controversial issues should be settled by individual Member States within their own borders. The third is the fact that pushing through certain decisions could arouse much opposition in the various Member States, and, as a direct result of this, help fuel Euroscepticism. We should not consent to such a thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Wallis that it was not the time to adopt a resolution on such a complicated issue, as this discussion illustrates, in which a series of data are being provided. Nevertheless, I believe it to be a fundamental principle that nobody can stand in the way of human progress on the basis of theological principles which have little to do with current realities. There are millions of people currently suffering from degenerative diseases as a result of a lack of progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that we are regressing to the Middle Ages and I believe that, in the 21st century, we must focus on the need for scientific progress and we must therefore oppose the patenting of biotechnological inventions, which relate, for example, to the connection of certain cells. I believe that it is entirely contrary to the current ethical requirements of a human race which is moving forward, which is progressing and which is not going to allow people to continue suffering from degenerative diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Commission has been absolutely right to present this report, which opens up possibilities, and I would like once again to congratulate Mr McCreevy on his explanation.

Nevertheless, we are also here this evening to give the Commissioner our views.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive under consideration still has many controversial areas subject to interpretation, which is why we would like clearer definition on certain essential points. We believe patents are important, but it must be made clear that legal and economic protection does not mean that everything is patentable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to understand that clear limits are also needed, especially in areas where the aim is to prevent infringements, as is happening with embryonic stem cells for the production of human parts and forms of cloning that are in fact banned under the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of patentability, which provides legal protection, Commissioner, therefore requires us to be careful not to permit any kind of concentration, which would arise if the scope of protection for DNA sequence patents were too broad and not restricted just to their specific uses.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I hope we will have the opportunity to examine these topics in greater depth, in the knowledge that there are lines in this field that I believe must not be crossed, such as the boundaries of human dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Using cells from embryos is unethical, whereas such considerations are irrelevant when adult stem cells are used. Around 95% of research funding is spent on the former, although no benefits have been derived from them, whereas only 5% of funding is spent on the latter, which offer many advantages. This begs the question of what is really going on here.</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 May, Professor Scolding, a neurophysiologist from the University of Bristol, gave an extremely interesting talk to Parliament’s Intergroup on Bioethics, during which he explained a great many facets of this issue. Embryonic stem cells are carcinogenic and prone to genetic mutations, and problems can arise due to their being rejected. They do not normally perform repair functions, and hence have to be forced to do so. Furthermore, ethical considerations surround the use of such cells. Adult stem cells taken from bone marrow, on the other hand, are intended to act in a healing capacity, and do not need to be forced to carry out tasks other than those for which they are adapted. No problems are posed in terms of the rejection of such cells, since a patient’s own cells are not carcinogenic and do not cause genetic mutations. What is more, the use of such cells is ethically unproblematic.</p>
<p class="contents">Professor Scolding is not the only one who knows about all these research findings, and in fact all experts in this field are familiar with them. The question we should therefore be asking is why so much money is spent on research into embryonic stem cells, and so little on research into adult stem cells. The answer is that no opportunities exist for the manufacture of drugs using the latter, since the cells themselves, which are harvested directly from the patient, are the drug. Drug manufacturers would earn nothing in such instances. In the case of embryonic stem cells, however, what counts is the fact that cell lines can be cultivated for various purposes and then sold, and this is why so much money is poured into research in this area. Such are the consequences of patents on cells. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In July 2005, the Commission presented a second report to the Council and Parliament on the development and implications of patent law in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it would be premature to adopt a position on the matter of whether patents on gene sequences and DNA sequences should be allowed according to the traditional model of patent claims, whereby a first inventor can claim an invention. Instead, we should continue to monitor the possibility that legislative disparities between Member States could have an economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of the Commission’s initiative to undertake studies analysing the extent to which human DNA has been patented in Europe, and the possible consequences that this may have for research and innovation. These studies should also incorporate legal, ethical and social aspects. Turning to the issue of totipotent stem cells, I do not believe that they should be patented, due to the implications that this would have for human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the Commission to take appropriate steps to establish a clearer and more predictable legal framework for biotechnological inventions. This framework should be informed by ethical considerations, and at the same time create a favourable climate for innovation and scientific and business development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
