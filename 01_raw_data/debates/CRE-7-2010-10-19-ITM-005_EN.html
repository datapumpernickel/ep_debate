<p class="contents">Colleagues, I should point out that a number of our distinguished guests from the Commission and the Council are currently stuck in a traffic jam, but they are on their way and should be here in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are about to conclude the last stage of a fascinating legislative and interinstitutional adventure: a quadrilogue on the establishment of an ambitious, efficient, accountable and forward-looking European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we will be discussing legislative texts relating to the Staff Regulations, the Financial Regulation and the amending budget. We will be voting on those texts tomorrow. They are the successful result of a month of intense negotiations between the European institutions, working together to achieve a common goal: ensuring that the European Union’s voice is heard and respected on the wider world stage. We in the European Parliament took our responsibilities very seriously. We took the view that in external actions, as in other areas, Community interests and methods must prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward to holding this final debate today. We are looking forward even more to the launch of the EEAS on 1 December 2010, just one year after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The institutions have shown that they can deal with challenges. Parliament was part of the solution. We made quick decisions – some perhaps were made too quickly. This service is uncharted territory – <span class="italic">terra incognita</span> – and breaks with some of the previous fundamentals of budgetary law and staffing law. That will present us with major challenges in the long term. For me, as a member of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the hybrid nature of this service remains a constant concern, not only in terms of its efficiency, but also simply in terms of our ability to monitor it. The joint Rivellini-Gräßle report attempts to address these problems. We have tried to achieve the best possible solution for the service, for Parliament and for taxpayers. We have explained processes and assigned responsibility. We have strengthened Parliament’s influence in respect of tasks in the area of foreign policy, we have increased transparency by means of clear reporting obligations and we have increased accountability. We have made it clear to the EU ambassadors that they have a key role to play in protecting the financial interests of the European Union, and it is very important that their own service should also make this clear to them. We have created synergies through the joint use of the accounting system and we are granting the Commission’s internal auditor the power to monitor how the funds that it needs to carry out its work efficiently are managed. The European Development Fund and its integration into the budget remain on the agenda, as does discharge for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone who made this outcome possible: the co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs who have co-signed the compromise. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the negotiating partners from the Belgian Presidency. They have done a good job.</p>
<p class="contents">What remains is the important homework that the service needs to do. No efficiency savings as a result of the merger are in sight. The service envisaged savings of 10%, which is not much, but it is a long way from meeting that when it comes to management positions. Everyone is whispering about a ‘Mexican army’. How professional can a service be if it does not even know exactly what its tasks are? The opportunities to define the tasks in more detail have not, as yet, been utilised, and it is very important to get back to this very soon. A great deal of importance should be attached to the coalescence of the staff. The preferential treatment that has been given up to now to diplomats from the Member States gives us cause for concern. If some positions are advertised several times and the old colonial map of the world is taken out once again, we will have to have very serious discussions about the service. We should assure the service of our critical support and the watchful eye of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I wish it the success that we need for Europe in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EEAS, created by the Treaty of Lisbon, will include staff members of the Council, the Commission and the national diplomatic services, who will represent the European Union in all matters of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As originally structured, the EEAS still suffered from a number of drawbacks deriving from its complex, decentralised structure, with ramifications throughout the world. In particular, the accountability of the financial actors called on to manage budgets of hundreds of millions of euros remained unclear, and that was likely to contribute to an increase in fraud and corruption to the detriment of the Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Treaty of Lisbon greatly expands Parliament’s powers and identifies it as the only institution representing Europe’s citizens, the debate on the establishment of the new EEAS was at first monopolised by the Commission and the Council, which did all they could to structure it along intergovernmental lines, contrary to the Community method. After long consultations with the Belgian Presidency and the European Commission, an agreement was reached overturning the initial arrangements and enhancing Parliament’s role, so that it could become involved by right at the heart of the European debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The following points are fundamental. The Commission shall present a working document annexed to the draft budget with a comprehensive presentation of, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, all administrative and operational expenditure related to the external actions of the Union, including the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy. Article 1 lists the European Union’s institutions. The lists of responsibilities are to be attached to the annual activity reports compiled by the Directors-General of the Commission. Heads of delegations shall attend the meetings of the relevant parliamentary committees, together with the Directors-General. The EEAS shall share an auditor and an accounting officer with the European Commission; this arrangement is to be reviewed in 2013. The Member States must undertake to fully support the Union in pursuing any kind of liability of temporary staff working for the European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">We subsequently have to discuss some important issues, which will be taken up during the triennial review of the Financial Regulation. They include discharge for the institutions and the inclusion of the European Social Fund in the general budget. The outcome of the negotiations has been good, especially for Parliament, in that its central importance has been strongly enhanced. The fact that the regulation lists all the institutions – which means that discharge for the other institutions is just a matter of time – is an excellent result, as is the fact that it provides for a single auditor and accounting officer held in common by the two institutions. I am grateful to everybody for the work that has been accomplished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am happy with the result, at least as regards the part for which I was responsible and where I had a grasp of the overall picture. However, I would say that this is not so very surprising, because it is not as if we have only just started. Mr President, it was a very clever idea of yours to call all the rapporteurs together on a regular basis for an exchange of ideas right from an early stage – back at the time of the Brok, Verhofstadt and Gualtieri reports. As a result, for the relevant people, it was clear what would need to be done later, and for those who were to do this later work, it was clear what had already been done in terms of preparatory work. For this reason, it was primarily a matter of applying to the Staff Regulations the organisational aspects of what had been agreed between Parliament and the Council in connection with the establishment of the European External Action Service in the particular areas of competence covered by these Staff Regulations. When I say organisational, I mean that organisation is policy and policy is organisation. That is, of course, something that we found repeatedly during the detailed negotiations, because it was already clear at that point that perhaps one person may interpret something one way and others may interpret it somewhat differently. However, the spirit of cooperation resulted, I believe, in us finding very sensible solutions to such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we actually need to do, then, in terms of policy adjustment and what did we need to lay down in the Staff Regulations? Firstly, we had to incorporate the equal treatment of the three staffing components. I want to mention this point because, as you know, the treaty states that the staff of the EEAS shall comprise officials from the Commission, the Council and from the diplomatic services of the Member States. The last of these elements, in particular, did pose something of an issue, as it was something new. We had to resolve the almost antagonistic contradiction between the Community approach and the intergovernmental approach. It goes without saying that the Council and the Member States take more of an intergovernmental approach, while we prefer the Community approach. I believe I can say that we then worked out a solution to this together. To that extent, then, we can be very satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">What we needed, and indeed must continue, to take into account is gender balance and a balance in terms of geographical origin. We want to have a service that is modern, including with regard to the issue of gender equality. I am pleased, Baroness Ashton, that, in addition to what we have incorporated into the Staff Regulations as mandatory, you have assured us that you will make another personal statement, which will form part of the whole package. That already represents considerable progress with regard to both the aspect of gender equality and the other aspect of geographical balance.</p>
<p class="contents">We need equal rights and equal obligations, and that includes loyalty – and indeed from all three components – towards the institution of the High Representative, currently embodied by Baroness Ashton. In this regard, we had a bit of additional work to do as far as the veto right of the diplomatic services was concerned in connection with possible extensions to the contracts of staff coming from the diplomatic services. However, we resolved this, too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one issue that should not be underestimated. We jointly agreed that this issue cannot be accommodated in the Staff Regulations. This is the fact that the new European diplomatic service also needs something of a separate identity. Everyone working there must be working towards the same goal and therefore, a common form of training and further training is also extremely important. That was especially important to some of my fellow negotiators, and I can understand that. I have just said that we did not succeed in doing this. It was clear that it would not be possible to incorporate something like this into the Staff Regulations systematically. However, here, once again, I have to thank the High Representative, because I have been informed that she also wants to say something about this and that she regards it as a major obligation and a major necessity and will also make another declaration of commitment in this regard, which, although not a component of the Staff Regulations, will reassure us and those who view it as particularly important as we look to the future work of the common External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing all that in mind, we have done a very good job, and the service is now set for a sound start on 1 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This position is due to Parliament’s desire to see the EEAS set up, because Europe urgently needs it, but, of course, it does not mean that it will give up its role as budgetary authority in the debate on the nature of the body that will deal with crisis management or on the priorities of staff policy, as shown by the reserve that we established in the 2011 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulations that we are going to adopt reinforce the outcomes of the Madrid agreement and, in some cases, go further, for which I would like to thank Mr Rapkay, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini. I must also thank Baroness Ashton and Mr Christophersen for their willingness and openness in our discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Staff Regulations ensure that all EEAS staff will have the same rights and duties irrespective of their origin, and requires the High Representative to ensure a geographical and gender balance. These arrangements will be binding and Parliament will make sure that they are complied with. At the same time, they avoid the use of quotas, which would be not just difficult to implement but also wrong. The Financial Regulation ensures a solid control system and keeps the EEAS closely tied to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the success we have achieved with the setting up of specific budget lines for the main common security and defence policy missions, which represents a major leap forward for Parliament’s ability to exercise control over the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With tomorrow’s vote, therefore, we will have an EEAS that is stronger, more <span class="italic">communautaire</span> and subject to greater Parliamentary scrutiny. We will be strict and demanding in performing this scrutiny but, at the same time, we will do it responsibly and in a constructive spirit, since we are determined to help the High Representative in the colossal task of providing Europe with a real foreign policy to serve its values and interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we planned the budget for 2010, we raised the question about resources for the external diplomatic service. The answer was that there was no need for resources in that respect, as this could be resolved by redistributing budgetary resources. Well, as members of the Committee on Budgets, we did not really believe this. The truth is somewhere in between. It was indeed possible to resolve the bulk of costs through the redistribution of budgetary resources, but by adding up two amendments, there is an extra cost of approximately EUR 44 million. This extra cost represents roughly the coverage of expenditures for one quarter, while we have seen that the setting up of the service is still at the 10% level. Obviously, the funds which I hope will be passed tomorrow would cover a period somewhat longer than what they are actually used for. This does generate or could have generated certain tasks, such as amendment of the amount. In our view, however, there is no point in doing so now. It is much more important to have this service set up as soon as possible and see some progress with it, because one of the important messages of the Treaty of Lisbon is that we should be visible in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while discarding time-wasting measures, we do formulate expectations, as it has already been done by previous rapporteurs. We think that geographic balance is very important where the setting up of the service is concerned, but we did not include any binding provision of reserves, also in order to give an impetus to the whole system. We would also like to see a guarantee that the funds available are used in a time-proportional manner and economically, as now we have to face constraints everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like to have very clear cooperation with, and mutual assistance from, Member States’ External Action Services, because if these elements are in place, it will allow certain tasks to be performed in countries where a Member State is not represented, but our European service is present. This will also be cost efficient for the Member States affected and will obviously improve the atmosphere of cooperation. Mr President, I hope that Parliament will support this redistribution of budgetary resources with its votes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the Commission also condemns any acts of terrorism and I am sure that it would react accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me to return to our debate, let me start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, for the excellent work he has done to table this proposal to your distinguished House. I commend the excellent cooperation we have had over the past months and weeks on this complex file. Let me also extend my compliments to the shadow rapporteurs as well to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs who have worked hard and constructively during the whole process. Last but not least, allow me to express my gratitude to Cathy, her team and the Commission services for their enormously hard work which will lead, I hope, to the establishment of the EEAS in a very short period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">This week’s work will conclude the complex work of laying the legal and budgetary foundation for the EEAS. They build on and are fully in line with the cornerstone of this process – the EEAS decision. I had the privilege of participating in the discussion on setting up the EEAS and I was honoured to represent the Commission in the famous quadrilogue in Madrid. I can be a direct witness as to how important the contribution of the representatives of the European Parliament, Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri, was to the successful conclusion of our very intense debate on this matter. I think the input they brought to our debate really contributed to having the EEAS as a truly efficient and effective European diplomatic service.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said about the work of your rapporteur, Mr Rapkay. The amendments to the Staff Regulations appear to be of a purely administrative nature, but they are not. They are essential in enabling the service to be up and running and to truly serve European interests. The Commission is of the opinion that the compromise package tabled by your rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, is a very good result that can be fully supported. The amendments have led, in my view, to a real improvement of the whole text.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight just a couple of the core elements of the proposal. As you know, the EEAS will be composed in its starting phase of the three sources mentioned in the treaty, namely, the Commission, the Council General Secretariat and national diplomats. The relevant departments of the Council and the Commission will be transferred to the EEAS, while the existing rights of the staff working in these departments will be fully guaranteed. National diplomats will be able to apply for published vacant posts. I am happy to say that, as of 1 July 2013, officials from other institutions including the European Parliament, will also be able to apply to the EEAS on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Permanent officials and national diplomats will have the same rights and obligations in the EEAS and the necessary provisions of the Staff Regulations will apply to ensure their independence and loyalty to the European Union. National diplomats will have contracts which can last up to a maximum of ten years. In addition, Member States will provide national diplomats with a guarantee of immediate reinstatement after their service in the European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise also includes provisions which express a strong commitment to reaching geographical and gender balance in the European External Action Service. The situation will be reviewed in 2013 with a report by the High Representative to be presented to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some of you in this House would have wished for stronger provisions in these proposals, whereas others were vehemently opposed. I am convinced that the amendments, as tabled to you now, constitute a balanced solution. The negotiations on this file have not always been easy. The preparatory process was quite complex as it required a consultation with our staff representative, but the hard work and the intensive negotiations have paid off, and you have a very good negotiation result for your House on your desks.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the European Parliament will adopt these amendments tomorrow. Allow me to conclude by expressing the Commission’s strong commitment to ensuring the smooth creation of the EEAS and its readiness to provide all necessary support and help to this new European service. I hope that tomorrow will mark an historic vote by this House which will lead to the establishment of the European External Action Service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The launch of the External Action Service required amendments to the Financial Regulation but, for the first time, this has been done under the ordinary legislative procedure. That is why tomorrow, Parliament will be amending the Council regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am really happy that we were able to reach an agreement in last week’s trialogue. It is proof that we can deliver under the Lisbon Treaty. It has also made it possible for us to give the European External Action Service a solid and timely basis. I do not wish to go into too much detail, but it allows for the creation of a separate section of the budget, it secures optimal accountability of the heads of delegations and it allows this External Action Service section of the budget to be overseen by a Commission accounting officer and the internal auditor. This is subject to review.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, for their constructive and cooperative approach.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to amending budget No 6, both arms of the budgetary authority are now, I hope, in a position to approve the amending budget without amendment. That is also a pre-condition for the External Action Service to start operating very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The justification for the first tranche of new AD posts is to cope with immediate additional tasks, but by 2013, we aim to have upheld our commitment for one-third of AD staff to come from the diplomatic services of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore invite Parliament to support the amending budget already approved by the Council. I should once again like to express my gratitude to the rapporteurs, Mr Surján and Mr Gualtieri. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I know that these have been tough negotiations at times and you have been tough negotiators. I believe that the outcome that we have before us is a good one and genuinely reflects the Lisbon Treaty in implementation, with Parliament playing a substantive and important role for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a joint and collaborative exercise and I am extraordinarily grateful to all of you for the work that has gone on. Most importantly, I believe we have set the foundations for the service in a way that will engage Parliament properly in the future, and I have already made my commitments to transparency and the approach that I wish to take in working with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also made it clear that this is a service that must reflect the breadth and the depth of the European Union. It is a service that I wish every Member of this House, every Member State, and every Member of the Commission to be really proud of. I wish to see Europe reflected in the staff that we have, in the ambassadors that we appoint, in the people at the centre. You will have many opportunities to ensure that that commitment is brought to bear, especially with the review in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, too, that Members have been concerned to ensure that we have proper training facilities and capacity. We do have the legal basis for this, and I want to reassure this House that we will make sure that those who come from different traditions, from different sources, will be brought together to create a truly European service that again will reflect all that has been said in the process of building up to this moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to say thank you particularly to Ms Lichtenberger and Mr Saryusz-Wolski for the work they have done on the issue of training. I know that there is much more we need to discuss and I look forward to doing so with you and with others over the coming weeks and months, but you have my full commitment to ensuring that training is part of how we approach the building of the service. I say this in the context of the economic backdrop and climate in which this service is coming into being, and you have a full commitment from me that there will be a cost-effective service.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this enables us to fulfil our aspirations and ambitions in the world. Every citizen of the European Union is affected by what we do in foreign policy, in trade and development, and in counter-terrorism. This is, above all, a service for them, and I stand before the representatives of the citizens of Europe to make my commitment to see this service fulfil your ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After the political agreement of Madrid and the European Parliament’s opinion issued on 8 July, on 26 July, the General Affairs Council, as you know, adopted a decision setting out the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service. However, in order for this service to be properly established, we still need to adopt the three instruments that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on these various dossiers has been intensive both for Parliament and the Commission, for the High Representative and the Council, and everyone has made an effort to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time, within the deadlines we were set.</p>
<p class="contents">We can now all celebrate and give ourselves a pat on the back for getting the job done successfully thanks to the agreements achieved on the various dossiers, after Parliament’s vote here during this session. On Monday, 25 October, the General Affairs Council may adopt these instruments at a political level. The European External Action Service can therefore, as planned, begin operations on 1 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything was basically reiterated this morning by Baroness Ashton, the commissioners and the rapporteurs. For my part, I shall limit myself to addressing the historical nature of this event which, a year after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, embodies one of its most significant innovations. By setting up the European External Action Service, both the coherence and the visibility of the Union’s external action will be strengthened considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the job is not over. It is just the beginning and the challenge is equal to our expectations, but I am sure we can count on the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to do so with energy and determination. In any case, I wish her every success in this mission.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I should like once again to thank the European Parliament for its commitment and its constructive approach which was decisive in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two hundred MEPs from the new Member States in this House will also be keeping an eye on this. Far more emphasis was placed on geographical balance than was the case in the initial proposal, although this was not sufficient. Arithmetic is not always right, and laws and geography cannot be outvoted. We believe that all men and women are equal and not that some are more equal than others.

In addition, the Commission’s proposal is improved by the amendments proposed by the main rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, which introduce provisions concerning the personnel of the European External Action Service and which have been included in the political agreement. They concern, in particular, gender equality and geographical balance among staff, as well as a balance between staff from European Union institutions and those with a background in national diplomatic corps. I hope the new External Action Service will appreciate the autonomic character of cooperation on development and will not treat this issue as a ‘carrot’ – an instrument for conducting foreign policy.

The new body obviously needs a budget. Nevertheless, it is at least as important to define and comply with budgetary principles and financial rules, due to budgetary and financial accountability. In the past years, our committee had a debate on this with DG RELEX. Therefore, I would like to give special emphasis to this issue. It is very important to establish appropriate organisational and operational regulations. It is important to bear in mind that the duplication of tasks, functions and resources must be avoided, and all options must be considered in order to ensure the efficiency of expenditures. Transparent and simple organisational structure and management of resources is the guarantee that the new organisation will operate efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Members will come from three sources: the EU institutions, the Member States and the experts of the recipient country. It is especially important that this body comprising members of EU institutions and Member State employees has full equality in this respect. Therefore, we consider that training is important, and it is very important that the principle and practice of selection be based on uniform processes and requirements. The Committee on Budgets will control this on an annual basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our work over the past few months has concentrated on ensuring that the service has the right legal basis and suitable instruments to enable its future work to be effective. We have worked under time pressure, and the negotiations have often been difficult. We have reached agreement with the Council and the Commission on many issues and I hope that the compromises which have been worked out will yield a favourable end result. The Committee on Legal Affairs had the task of proposing amendments to the Staff Regulations which will be appropriate to the needs of the new service and which will also guarantee that it will be independent and that its work will be of a high standard. I think the amendments adopted yesterday evening at the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs do give such guarantees, although personally, I do not find them completely satisfying, particularly on one matter. I think the question of geographical balance, which is emphasised so often, could have been resolved in a much better way. I do, of course, welcome the declarations made by the High Representative that she is going to give particular attention to ensuring participation in the service by citizens from all the Member States, and I also welcome the provision that in 2013, a report will be presented in which the High Representative will provide information on the work of the service.</p>
<p class="contents">Union diplomacy is supposed to be European, and the truth is that the citizenship of its staff members should not play a special role. However, where we come from and what our roots are form our worldview, and this has a significant influence on our perception of the world around us. It is a fact that there are still Member States in the Union which are under-represented in all the institutions. If Europe is to be united in diversity, it is necessary to give Europe a chance for that diversity to be properly maintained and expressed. This, in fact, was what our discussions on geographical balance were about, and not, as some mistakenly think and understand, guaranteeing fixed quotas for Member States. I thank the rapporteurs for good cooperation, and my wish for Mrs Ashton is that she will be able to put our efforts to good use in her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, not everyone is satisfied yet, and I also understand the concern, particularly regarding geographical balance. However, I can assure Mr Saryusz-Wolski that we all – not just the new Members of this House – must ensure that we achieve a better geographical balance, and that we all – not just the women – must ensure that we achieve a healthy gender balance. That is necessary, and I take the promises seriously. We will certainly press for these things to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, it is a question of providing a common service of the highest quality for the European Union. I see no contradiction here. On the contrary, everything must be reduced to a common denominator, because now it is time to act; now it is also time to show our commitment to the European Union operating at international level. In Iran, the High Representative has already taken over the leadership role, and it is very important that we achieve good results here. In the Middle East, it is important for us not only to provide funds, but also to get involved, and we should do this for the sake of the issue at hand, not simply for the prestige. Where Russia is concerned, we need to ensure that we achieve a pragmatic relationship, albeit one based on values, particularly in the interests of our common neighbours. With the United States, we need to negotiate on equal terms. Where there are problems, we also need to address these openly so that we can stand together with the United States in the fight against terrorism and in the reshaping of globalisation. China is a new emerging power, and we do not want to prevent that, but we object to a form of nationalism that is developing a certain degree of aggressiveness, particularly in that region in Asia. We want to involve China more in the international community, including in the international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For the High Representative, too, that is surely also one of the most important issues that needs to be addressed, namely to ensure that, in these new international multilateral institutions, we also achieve an appropriate new regulation and new distribution of influence and power, where the European Union is not restricted, but where there is acceptance of the fact that there are also new global players. All of these are huge tasks for the diplomatic service and ones for which the High Representative needs our full support. The Belgian Presidency – in other words you, Mr Chastel – has just promised that it will also give due support to the High Representative. This promise is a good one, and the words of congratulations are also good, but I hope that the foreign ministers also recognise the fact that it does not make any sense to play one of us off against the other, but that there is only one option, and that is for the foreign ministers, the High Representative and us in this Parliament to be able, together, to represent Europe strongly to the outside world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton certainly does not have an easy task ahead of her now that our common European External Action Service is to be established. However, together with the Council and the Commission, Parliament has laid the foundation for an effective representative organisation that will truly be able to represent Europe and European values and interests around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s strength is diversity. The European Union is made up of people with different backgrounds, skills and experience. By creating an External Action Service that utilises men and women recruited from all of our Member States, we are also utilising Europe’s greatest strength and resource. At the same time, there must be absolutely no doubt that it is skills and qualifications that are decisive when it comes to making appointments to posts within the new External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has a fine motto: united in diversity. These are words that carry obligations and they have a deep meaning. I hope that, under Baroness Ashton, the External Action Service will develop into a genuine European service that will represent citizens from all of our Member States, women as well as men. Those who are to work in our common External Action Service must be clearly trained to represent the whole of the Union.

We have laid the ground for an inclusive service that is based on equality and an <span class="italic">esprit de corps</span>. Thank you, Mrs Ashton, for mentioning the training measures in respect of gender equality and geographical balance in your proactive measures. I should like to thank everyone in this House, Mrs Ashton and the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">But have we created a modern service that is more than a 28th national diplomatic service? What is the added value of the European External Action Service?</p>
<p class="contents">I think the game is still open. First of all, it will require effective coordination across policy areas. I still want to see the structures in place to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we have to enhance crisis management and conflict prevention. That can be an added value provided by the European Union. That will depend on the implementation of the ‘appropriate structure’, and it will depend on how we use new posts and posts created through synergies across the Council and the Commission. Along these lines, do we need more deputy ambassadors? Or will it not be your role, Mrs Ashton, to send an SMS? We are living in the 21st century. The role of former diplomats belongs in the 19th century. Should we not have a debate on whether we really need these people, and what we need them for?</p>
<p class="contents">I hope your establishment plan and your staffing priorities will reflect the priorities as promised and will make the service really deliver added value – something that not every national diplomatic service has, and can do. For us, there are two priorities: conflict prevention and civilian crisis management. Create a mediation cell, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">On human rights, we want this service to be strong on human rights, with capacity at the highest level. Gender equality does not end with staffing priorities. It is also about gender mainstreaming and attaching a high degree of importance to missions and mandates. In that respect, I think it would be a good idea to have an overview and review of the existing CSDP missions that have been completed, to learn from the past for the future of your service, Mrs Ashton. I think that will bring us all forward.</p>

We must not create the impression that some countries are not being given recognition in relation to creation of the new service. The service should reflect the cultural wealth and different national traditions in Europe, including in the field of diplomacy. Therefore, a group of MEPs, which includes myself, has prepared an amendment which provides for the introduction of a geographical balance factor. This is so that when candidates selected in competitions are found to have similar competences, the deciding factor for appointment should be the geographical criterion. It is not, therefore, a rigid solution which imposes geographical criteria of this type when recruiting staff for the future service, but a flexible and auxiliary measure. Adoption of such a provision will reduce current disproportions and allow us, in time, to ensure greater representativeness. I would like to emphasise that this solution preserves the central significance of the competence criterion, which is so important for those who have created these measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not going to vote against but we are not going to be able to vote in favour, as we consider that unfortunately, the result was not what we were aiming for. What we were aiming for was comprehensive control by this House of the External Action Service. Of course it has not been possible to change the structure, as that was not the matter in hand, and we are not convinced by that structure, which is taking responsibility for security and external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have fought a very significant democratic battle in the national parliaments – at least in mine – on security, in order to have complete control so that even any deployment of troops abroad must be subject to comprehensive parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are very far from that control, and for those reasons, we are not going to vote in favour tomorrow. In any case, I would like to conclude by thanking you for the work you have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An instrument at the service of European policy – and I emphasise ‘European’ – must not select its staff on the basis of their geographical origin or gender, but according to their quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the Member States should be represented in the structure of the new service and that a large proportion of women would be appropriate. None of that, however, can take precedence over the criteria of merit and professional excellence. What we must do instead is ensure strictly equal access to these posts for everyone, without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards training, there are places like the European University Institute in Florence that have the expertise to provide excellent training.

With the European External Action Service, we are now attempting to bring the foreign policy instruments of the Union within a coherent framework. The resources that we already have are being bundled together and new ones are being added to complete the picture.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the report by our fellow Members, in view of the novel nature of this structure, ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied. We need a detailed overview of the tasks and of the staff employed in the EEAS.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the budgetary sovereignty of the European Parliament to also extend to the EEAS, the service must be incorporated into the structure of the Commission, and the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority, must be provided with the all information to enable it to scrutinise the accounts efficiently. The discharge of the Council remains on our agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The EEAS can only bear its name if all of the Member States are fairly represented within it. On the other hand, of course, the qualifications of the candidates must take priority. This leads me to the proportion of women represented. It is far too low for my liking and I call for qualified women to be found for these positions. They do exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what would he have been without a big band? You, Baroness Ashton, are now the voice of Europe, and with the External Action Service, you are getting a splendid orchestra. I hope that you will make use of this orchestra to bring Europe’s voice to the fore and to protect our interests. Since Europe’s first priority is to safeguard peace in Europe, the next major task, in view of the international challenges – from energy security right up to combating terrorism, globalisation and much more – is to look after Europe’s interests in the world. You and this service will have a special role to play in this regard. Therefore, the progress that we make in the interests of our citizens will depend very strongly on your work and that of your orchestra.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process, we have succeeded in enhancing Parliament’s cooperation, control and right to information, including in the area of the budget. We have succeeded in safeguarding the Community character of the policies that are Community policies and also in ensuring that more than 60% of the staff must be Community officials. I am certain that, in contrast to the Council, we have managed to introduce better geographical balance and gender parity. The governments did not do this; we did their job for them. Moreover, if this is now legally binding and a review must also be carried out in 2013, then it is an excellent achievement by this House – a good compromise that we have reached between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This instrument must also be observed by us. We will do this with the necessary flexibility, but we will also exert pressure to ensure that you, Baroness Ashton, are able to succeed in your task. You will have our support in this, but you can also be sure of our criticism if we do not agree, because I believe that we can only stand together on this matter if our citizens have a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Such a vision will not last without an ambitious, accountable, efficient and ‘communautarian’ External Action Service. Such a service will not function effectively without staff recruited on the basis of merit.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe most of us can agree on these principles. The devil is, however, in the detail. And it is precisely these details, which have transformed a report that was meant to be technical into a source of passionate political debate, which risks dividing us deeply.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no dilemma between ‘communautarianism’ and intergovernmentalism, between merits or quotas, between old and new Member States. Nevertheless, the triumph of ‘communautarianism’ requires that each and every national of each and every Member State feels fairly treated on the basis of their merits.</p>
<p class="contents">The triumph of the merit criterion must be tested by the equilibrium of the results of the selection, since God, I believe, distributed merits and sins in a balanced way to men and women, old and young, small and big, weak and powerful, westerners and easterners, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that some in our Union – mainly but not only among the new members – feel they are discriminated against. Even if this perception were wrong, we should still treat it with respect and care since our unity is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the criteria which are being questioned, but the insufficiency of guarantees that they will be properly enhanced, and of corrective measures to be applied when imbalances are obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only hope that the High Representative will correct the imbalances in the process which apparently fuelled these perceptions, and I also hope that a future European diplomatic academy, or something similar, will help us to create a corps of European diplomats who are competent and loyal to our common interest and to the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This could prove one of the greatest strides towards a truly full-fledged European foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in my own country, which I am afraid is becoming increasingly introverted, a transfer of tasks to this new EEAS is in evidence in the new coalition agreement. Admittedly, this has only concerned the consular tasks so far, but I am convinced that the realisation will soon come that other diplomatic tasks, too, would be best handled at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, today we are focusing, in particular, on the financial and organisational side of the EEAS, and that is an important aspect. Not until sufficient transparency and financial responsibility are in place will this service be fully capable of action. Therefore, I am delighted with the agreement that has been reached among the institutions to really get started. That had been at risk on account of Parliament’s putting very detailed requirements on the table. Indeed, we, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, had opposed those somewhat.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs. A good package has been achieved, which will enjoy the full support of my group.

British Conservatives opposed the creation of this service, fearing it would erode Britain’s prerogative to exercise an independent foreign policy. Now that the service is a political reality, we will engage with it constructively in order to ensure that British interests are indeed promoted and protected.</p>
<p class="contents">One way is by lobbying for British EU officials and British diplomats from the Foreign Office to fill posts in the service, because surprisingly, the UK is under-represented in the EU institutions. While the new service needs to be representative of the EU’s 27 Member States, it must be built, first and foremost, on merit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Member States are making deep cuts in public spending. The EU must be sensitive to the need for austerity, particularly when it comes to the budget of the EEAS.

When decisions are made on matters of principle, the power of veto still applies, and so, in the case of major decisions, such as the intervention in Iraq or the secession of Kosovo, there has been no European Union foreign policy in existence.

At present, the number of employees from the countries of the ‘old 15’ is significantly and disproportionately greater than the number of those from the new Member States. I will quote some figures: before the last nominations, of 115 ambassadors, just two were from countries which acceded to the Union from 2004 onwards. Among the 29 ambassadors who were recently nominated, only four are from the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow such a division to become a rule in the operation of the future External Action Service. Without the right geographical representation, we are not in a position to establish a strong External Action Service which will act effectively in the interests of all of us. Neither will we be proud of such a service, as the High Representative, Lady Ashton, has said. I am also convinced that the use of a transition period, during which the disproportionally low representation of the new Member States would be gradually increased, will allow us to move efficiently and effectively towards a situation in which our objective, which is to promote the European Union as a key player in the international arena, will be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From tomorrow, when we are due to make the final decisions, we will expect real results. I am confident, of course, even as the debate went on today, that the European Parliament will be a European institution which will help, encourage and pass on its ideas to the new service so that it will be really effective and successfully create a more active, visible role for the European Union on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the European External Action Service is perhaps the most visible result of the Treaty of Lisbon. All of us who supported this treaty would like to see this service, too, as a successful project.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you, Lady Ashton, that you inherited a heavily imbalanced administration and it has transpired, unfortunately, that the main criticisms were somehow levelled at you. Indeed, at the start of this year, since when you have been High Representative and Vice-President, new Member States had just one head of delegation in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to challenge outright the notion that there is any conflict between qualifications and geographical balance. On the contrary, I believe that geographical balance goes hand in hand with higher qualifications. This is why we hope that your commitment will be implemented from now on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now only six weeks until Baroness Ashton will no longer primarily be the Minister responsible for establishing an EU foreign ministry; she will instead be the Foreign Minister for Europe, and that is a good thing. This will commence on 1 December and we wish you every success in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had many debates and we have achieved a great deal. It was a fruitful political battle. The lack of democracy associated with the old common foreign and security policy has been eliminated, there is a greater degree of accountability and the quality of the public debate has improved. There will be more stringent budgetary control, the prerequisites for a genuine team spirit have been created and national diplomats can, if they so wish, remain in the European External Action Service. There will be no geographical quotas – you could sometimes get the impression that this is the most important issue here, but it most definitely is not. Germany, in particular, would benefit greatly from a quota, but I am nevertheless against this. A common form of training will be provided. I believe that the prerequisites for a successful EEAS are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy. We would be really happy if you were now to take advantage of the opportunity and actually establish the appropriate structure for conflict prevention and crisis management that has been promised. Then we would have European added value right from the start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Difficulties are also evident in developing principles for recruiting personnel for Union diplomatic offices. The principle of solidarity and representativeness, which has guided the Union for a long time, must not be obscured by the selfishness of some of the large Member States. The distribution of positions in diplomatic offices lies in the hands of Mrs Ashton, who is present, today, and who is making appointments exclusively on a discretionary basis. Out of the well over 100 diplomatic offices around the world, the sixth largest Member State of the European Union, Poland, has been given only two. It should, therefore, be asked what criteria guided the Commissioner when she distributed appointments in this way. I would like to remind everyone that it is, actually, our House which decides the structure of the budget for shaping Union diplomacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In that respect, I would like to focus on an aspect of the report that has involved us in difficult negotiations: the issue of geographical balance in the composition of the European diplomatic corps. Some Members would, in fact, have preferred different criteria for the selection of staff, based on country of origin and citizenship. Such proposals have been avoided by means of balanced compromise amendments, which have been able to take geographical and gender balance into account without imposing country-based selection criteria. The selection of country-based quotas would not, in fact, have been a suitable or desirable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">After over 50 years of European integration, the Union’s first real diplomatic corps is now being created. It has to be put in a position to be able to develop a common foreign policy and serve the Union’s interests on the international stage. For it to accomplish this task, it is crucial that its staff represent the Union and not the Member States of which they are citizens or have been diplomatic officers. That is the line that the Committee on Legal Affairs took yesterday when adopting the Rapkay report, and that is the line that I hope will continue to be taken in the vote in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance.

The approval of the amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which will introduce ‘merit’ as the criterion for selecting the EU’s Heads of Delegation (the diplomats who will represent the European Union in third countries), will show us, once it has been implemented by the European External Action Service of socialist Catherine Ashton, that Romania and other new Member States will be left empty-handed. I am disappointed that even this time, we have not been able to reach a consensus among Romanian MEPs promoting Romania’s interests. I would have expected Adrian Severin, as a former foreign minister (albeit for only a few months), to support the introduction of some clear criteria regarding the allocation of Head of Delegation posts (number of inhabitants, number of seats in the European Parliament and the weighting of votes in the Council), instead of a highly subjective and vague criterion based on ‘merit’. Especially because, as far as I am aware, intelligence is spread evenly across the EU and we do not have all the clever people gathered in the West, with only the idiots left in the East. When it comes to diplomacy, Romania has representatives who deserve to take up positions as Heads of Delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of new EU Member States, particularly the last two which joined in the last wave of enlargement, are under-represented on the foreign relations side within DG RELEX. Lady Ashton has already expressed her desire for the EEAS to be made up of the best officials selected on the basis of professional criteria, and not according to countries of origin. Let us remind Lady Ashton that all EU Member States enjoy the same rights and, therefore, they must be sufficiently represented in the structures of the new European diplomatic service, both at the headquarters in Brussels and in the EU delegations. We therefore urge Lady Ashton to bear in mind that the European Union has 27 Member States. They must be able to contribute through their representatives in the EEAS to achieving the EU’s foreign policy objectives and to ensuring this institution’s credibility in the eyes of all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the few days before adoption of the report, the matter of geographical balance proved to be a bone of contention. Fellow Members from what are known as the old countries argued that the EU diplomatic corps which is just being set up should recruit the best of the best, and that recruitment should be based only on the criteria of candidates’ knowledge and experience (merit only), while as Members from the new countries, we drew attention to the fact that in our countries, too, there is no shortage of superb professionals, but that despite the passing of six years from accession, the 10 new countries are still strongly under-represented in Union structures. For example, the proportion of Poles in the European Commission Directorate-General for External Relations, which will be incorporated into the EEAS, amounts to only 2%. The concept of geographical balance, in the version proposed by the rapporteur, is, in my opinion, not clear enough and cannot be considered a clear legal basis for taking measures to correct this imbalance. Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot endorse the report, although apart from this question, it does contain many valuable proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These should not be the balances of yesterday’s Europe, but the balances of the enlarged EU that are reflected in amendment seven. I am happy that the High Representative has taken on board most of Parliament’s proposals, including the principle of parliamentary supervision. It is crucial that the issue of geographical balance has been addressed comprehensibly, and in a legally binding way, which means that in case of serious problems, it is enforceable by law. We are not rivals to the Commission, but allies, and can succeed only in mutual partnership. As for the substance, I would stress the future responsibility of the EU delegations to monitor the human rights situation in a given country, including regular contacts with the Sakharov prize winners and candidates there. It is in our common interests to make the EEAS operational in 2011. We look forward to the High Representative’s report to the European Parliament on its implementation in two years time and are prepared to make the necessary modifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Building such a complex entity, which deals with an essential and increasingly significant area of competence of the European Union, is no mean task in today’s global reality. It is particularly vital to ensure that the work of the service serves to strengthen Europe’s position. To this end, we must ensure that extremely well qualified people, with the relevant skills and experience, join its ranks, so that representatives from all the Member States will be able to participate in the implementation of the European Union’s foreign policy. I welcome the fact that Mr Rapkay’s report takes into account issues such as the promotion of equal opportunities for the under-represented gender in certain function groups and a geographic balance in the recruitment of European External Action Service employees. A well-organised service, which employs the foremost experts from all the Member States, provides an opportunity for the European Union to gain importance and to make full use of its potential on the international stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the excessive administration is also increased at the same time, as has happened in Greece, with the government expanding despite the need for rescue packages, then the people in Europe will quite rightly be annoyed. The EU has hitherto always boasted that it has a lean administration – which, of course, is not true if we take into account the separate agencies. Fifty directors-general with a princely EUR 17 000 per month for an initial 30 employees, 73 promotions to the position of director – we could easily get the impression that this is a self-service shop. Of course, it is important for an EEAS employee to have the right qualifications. In this regard, gender quotas, for example, do not serve any useful purpose. However, as the saying goes, ‘he who pays the piper calls the tune’, so it makes sense not to offend the net contributors. The refusal to increase the use of German as a working language in the EEAS has already created some diplomatic rifts. It is not a good idea to widen them. The EEAS will have to ensure that the EU is no longer merely an extension of the United States, because up to now, we have allowed the Americans to interfere in sensitive EU matters, such as the forced enlargement to include Turkey, and, as a result, have neglected important partners like Russia. The world order no longer consists of these two powers alone; there are also emerging powers like China. We must not overlook that fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a long-awaited measure towards consolidating the position of the European Union as a proficient global actor. However, I am somewhat disappointed that although appointments to the EEAS will be made using a thorough selection procedure based on merit and having regard to gender and geographical balance, it still does not guarantee proportional representation of nationals of all Member States. It should be noted that while pooling human resources from the Commission, the Council and the Member States, one third from each, some Member States are still under-represented in the Commission and the Council, which might result in an implicit imbalance in the service. I fully agree that the service ought to be made up of competent professionals, but I am also more than sure that there are suitable candidates equally from both genders and from all the Member States. The fact that the European Union is an egalitarian organisation of 27 Member States should be clearly reflected in the composition of the European External Action Service in order to put our values into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were tough negotiations between the three pillars of the Union: the Council, the Commission and the Parliament, so each, even if not completely satisfied, saw its main interests safeguarded. During the entire process, emphasis was placed inevitably on the national representation of the Member States in the staffing process. Things were not helped when, in spite of the ongoing negotiations to set its rules, the process continued unabated and, as a consequence, only some countries have seen their representatives getting the positions they were seeking.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that the main challenge to the new service lies less in composition than in substance: if we want the members of the EEAS to be truly European, then we will have to provide them with a truly European foreign policy to implement. In that respect, both the multi-polar structure of the international system and the current crisis are important obstacles to be dealt with vigorously. Otherwise, the EEAS will only pursue the national objectives of the individual members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EEAS also needs the same internal auditor and authorising officer as the European Commission for the purposes of financial control. Finally, it is important that the Member States have committed to fully supporting the EU in the enforcement of any budgetary liability of temporary servants and in agreeing to create separate lines for CFSP expenditure, at least for major missions.
