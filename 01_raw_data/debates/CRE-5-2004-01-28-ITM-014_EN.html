<p class="contents">China is a particular worry, since in addition to its competitiveness – the result of low business costs – it has a very aggressive trade policy, and shows little respect for the rules governing international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent studies indicate job losses in the European Union in the order of 40-60% by 2010 depending on the sector. If we add to this the fact that the European textile and clothing industry is concentrated in certain regions, with a predominantly female labour force, you will realise the gravity of the situation, and the urgent need for decisive action on the part of public administrations at all levels if the sector is to be successful in meeting the challenges it now faces.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the primary responsibility lies with the business directors who are responsible for defining strategies and making the investments needed in these new circumstances, but it is equally true that public authorities have an obligation to ensure that operating conditions are conducive to development.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the industry’s future will include a reassessment of the sector’s comparative advantages: the quality of goods, design, the fashion factor, and, above all, the sector’s capacity for innovation and for developing new hi-tech products, especially intelligent fabrics and industrial fabrics. There will also be a phase of considering the opportunities for moving into the international market. This is why the measures proposed in the Commission’s communication are so welcome, because they address this very issue. For this reason, I am also very pleased that Commissioner Busquin is with us today, given the importance of research and development if the sector is to emerge victorious in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is when and how to implement the measures detailed in the communication. It is all very well to analyse the sector’s problems and to determine how best to resolve them, but funding also needs to be set aside for the measures, which include creating a specific regional assistance programme for the sector which does not qualify as state aid and for providing training for workers to help them adapt to the changing labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">This also needs to be combined with an action plan and with the adoption of a firm timetable so that activities can get under way before the end of 2004 and above all, before it is too late. We also need a firm commitment from the Commission that it will not reduce the trade policy measures it is proposing to put a stop to unfair competition, and to high duties, peak tariffs and non-tariff barriers which make market access so difficult. Commissioner, the future of the sector and the continued existence of thousands of jobs are in your hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that this debate is taking place, among other reasons, because of the Commission’s communication on the textile industry in the context of an enlarged Europe, for which I want to thank the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication proposes a whole range of measures to assist the sector in its efforts to define a strategy in view of the new market challenges and, in particular, in view of the end of import quotas from 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Some recent and imminent events, such as China joining the WTO and the elimination of quotas and duties for certain products, are forcing the industry to take steps to resolve problems rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, some of the measures proposed in the communication are urgently needed. Firstly, it is important to have both Community and national policies that encourage SMEs to invest directly in research and development activities, and in innovation, as an essential means of incorporating new production processes, of encouraging creativity and fashion, and as a result, increasing the sector’s ability to compete on the global market.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that such matters merit consideration. A short while ago, Commissioner Busquin talked to me about these initiatives – initiatives such as creating support offices for SMEs to help them obtain intellectual property rights protection for brand names, designs and patents.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would say that we need to obtain agreements within the WTO whereby certain countries which are our rivals or which have zero duty access to our markets, or at least very low levels of duty, are required to reduce their current high duty levels as an essential part of trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is very important that the Commission implement the proposed measures on protecting intellectual property rights. Third countries must respect these rights, and it is also essential that we monitor compliance with the APIC agreements, if we are to combat piracy and counterfeiting. I do hope that the rapid approval of the Directive on enforcing intellectual property rights, and the revision of the customs regulation, will become key instruments in protecting this industrial property which is so important for so many sectors, including textiles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to express my appreciation for the high quality of the Commission Communication on the future of the textile industry in an enlarged Europe. We are still very concerned, however, and many questions remain unanswered. I shall now highlight some, as raised by Mrs Ferrer. How will the Commission translate proposals into specific actions? What timetable does it envisage and what budget does it intend to use for implementing these measures? Commissioner Lamy’s optimistic words, regarding the textiles and clothing industry, come to mind at this point. He classified it as a sector with a future in the European Union and of major importance for the European agenda for trade. Commissioner Lamy recently said that ‘by 2005 import quotas will have been abolished, but our commitment to the industry will not waver’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to address current and future challenges, while resolutely guaranteeing jobs in the sector. It is essential to promote companies’ competitiveness through innovation, flexible production practices and by providing the current workforce in the industry with vocational training and further education. I should like to highlight some of the points in the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly: the vital role of structural funds. I endorse the request to establish, within the financial framework of the structural funds, a specific regional initiative for the sector in order to address the difficulties that will arise in 2005 and to adapt the workers to the new demands of the employment market;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly: creating a textiles and clothing monitoring centre. This will make it possible to analyse the development of trade between China and the EU and to ensure compliance with the rules in force in both regions. Assuming that the Commission agrees, when could such a monitoring centre be created?</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly: bilateral trade agreements. All of the EU’s bilateral trade agreements must incorporate the principle of corporate social responsibility, compliance with the fundamental rights laid down by the International Labour Organisation and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that context, I am delighted to welcome the Commission’s communication on this matter. The region I represent, the East Midlands, has the largest cluster of clothing companies in the United Kingdom and has the second largest clothing and textile industry in Europe. Many of my constituents working in this industry have been made redundant time after time and they see manufacturing moving to the low-wage economies of developing countries. It is understandable that to these workers, who are still in such vulnerable positions, protectionist measures seem an attractive proposition. However, in the long term this is not the way to deal with the problems facing the industry today. In today’s global economy the EU is never going to be able to compete on price alone and nor should it. The EU should maximise the advantages of well-trained workers who are motivated, skilled and experienced.</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded in this industry in the past and we can continue to do so in the future. There are different, innovative ways to face the challenges of increasing global competition. For some businesses EU funding has proved to be an important tool in boosting competitiveness. The East Midlands Textile Association runs numerous projects – funded through the European Regional Development Fund – which assist companies: projects such as MAS, which helps small businesses in the region to branch out into new markets, or the Business ICT Bureau, which provides an expert source of ICT help specific to the needs of the textile sector. These are good examples of how funding is being used to help establish networks between local organisations working in the same area. While funding programmes are beneficial, they are also short-term in nature. I know that work is being done to ensure that maximum long-term economic benefit will be gained by harnessing the East Midlands textile cluster.</p>
<p class="contents">For other businesses the answer may be to look towards technical textiles, ranging from specialist heat- and chemical-resistant materials to flight socks designed to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis. I should like to raise a note of caution here. For some companies the correct response to the challenges is to look to the high-tech field, but it is not an option available to everyone. It would be easy to say that companies are resistant to change. If you look at small organisations with just a few employees and tight profit margins it is much more difficult for those companies to make the significant investment in research that will come more easily to the bigger players.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that the head office of the trade union, KFAT, is in Leicester, my home town. That union has informed the debate about the future of the textile industry. I, like the industry, the trade unions and those who work in it, look forward to the implementation of the Commission’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Consequently, the threatened total abolition of import quotas next 1 January may seriously hamper development and exacerbate unemployment, especially in areas with the highest concentration of textiles and clothing companies, such as the North and Beiras regions of Portugal. There is currently a serious problem of multinationals relocating; in my home town of Vila Nova de Gaia, for example, there is a German company, Brax Portugal, threatening to close down within days and to lay off 450 workers, mainly women. This is a serious problem that is repeated more or less throughout Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be borne in mind that the textiles and clothing industry is of major strategic importance to the EU with great prospects for the future, and that it can make a major contribution towards promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion. It may also, however, cause serious unemployment and hamper development unless we adopt appropriate measures to ensure that such problems do not arise in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the proposals that we have tabled, promoting the interests of the production sector, given that a cohesive whole depends on all parts of the chain. The aim is to ensure the survival both of mid-range products and of those with a high added value, and to guarantee job prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that the Commission present a concrete, cohesive and clearly defined action plan, in terms of instruments, financial resources and timetable. Particular attention should be paid in such an action plan to encouraging innovation and using new technology in the sector, to strengthening interaction between the various sectors of the industry, to carrying out an extensive programme of vocational training, to modernising and strengthening support for small and medium-sized enterprises and to protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">A Community programme must also be established, with suitable support mechanisms, especially for those less-favoured regions that depend on the sector. A sectoral approach must also be adopted for the textiles and clothing sector, specifically within the framework of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The import tariffs in the European Union now rank among the lowest in the world. That requires comparable market liberalisation on the part of other countries that have large textile sectors and markets. The rapporteur and Commissioner Lamy are rightly committed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following the abolition of quantitative restrictions, there will be the temptation to adopt alternative ways of restricting imports for protectionist reasons: anti-dumping measures and safeguard clauses, for example. How does the Commissioner intend to prevent this? Non-tariff barriers, such as unnecessary bureaucratic import procedures, also need to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns labelling and certification. As the rapporteur acknowledges, these are essential for the protection of core labour and environmental standards. What specific steps does the Commissioner envisage to give more substance to these, particularly with regard to the means of production?</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to make an observation about the trading position of developing countries, which requires not merely access to the European market; the European Union must also stop dumping cotton, which interferes with the market in raw materials. Providing EUR 900 million per annum in export subsidies to European cotton farmers is not conducive to a better price on the world market. The result is that the world price for a bale of cotton has fallen by half since 1990. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ours is a vote in favour of placing greater emphasis on free, equal and fair trade, and on respect for the principle of reciprocity in international trade relations, which, as is well documented, is not currently respected, particularly in the textiles and clothing sector. We also believe that it is essential to pay greater attention to the case of China, treating it with objectivity and realism. A mere monitoring centre will not be sufficient. Clear measures must be implemented to combat China’s hegemony in terms of the international trade in textiles and clothing.</p>
<p class="contents">China already accounts for almost 25% of world textile production, an alarming figure, particularly for genuine developing countries such as Bangladesh or Vietnam, which may also be crushed by the Chinese steamroller in this sector. We feel that, in view of its considerable muscle in this industry, China can no longer be considered a developing country. Otherwise we run the risk of killing the textiles and clothing industry everywhere else in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, still on the question of access to markets, we feel that it would have been useful if the resolution had mentioned – it is too late at this juncture – the need to implement a series of practical actions in the area of trade, to be developed by business, with the aim of penetrating new markets. It would be essential to establish support mechanisms to take part in trade fairs, to open sales outlets and distribution platforms, and to carry out prospecting missions of target markets, etc. These are measures that we have submitted to the Commission for consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sector has a pioneering history, an active present and a future full of challenges and uncertainties. The European textiles industry is today threatened by competition from countries where prices for goods are extremely low and where there are no environmental concerns or constraints. Exploitation of labour, particularly of child labour, reminds us of the wretched conditions that marked our own industrial revolution. Yet the textiles industry continues to survive, modernise and renew itself. It is the point where industry, craft and art converge, and it plays a major role in people’s lifestyles.</p>
<p class="contents">The neo-liberal dogmas that had previously held back the EU, fearful of a de-industrialised Europe, from adopting an industrial policy, are now obsolete. European decision-makers can now see what is happening and can take a stand in defence of the textile and clothing industry. The Commission communication is therefore most welcome, albeit over-long. We also support the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer, containing the essential elements of a European policy for the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Since trade policy falls within the exclusive competence of the EU, it is of vital importance that the Commission does not turn the textiles and clothing sector into a bargaining chip to win concessions in other areas deemed more appealing. To do so would be pitifully short-sighted and ethically reprehensible. On the other hand, the negotiators of the Doha Agenda for development must fight for conditions of access to markets of third countries that are equitable, requiring in particular that they comply with the principle of reciprocity and open up new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal, as we all know, is a country in which jobs and economic and social cohesion depend a great deal on the textiles and clothing sector. It is therefore highly sensitive to the downturns and slumps of this industry. Some highly industrialised regions of Portugal are even experiencing economic crisis, as we speak. The Commission must therefore back up its words with action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appreciate that these are challenging times for the textile industry. I appreciate too that we are running into a new era where import controls will be different and a new sector will be joining our textile industry. But, to inject a note of optimism, just as I said in the debate in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, one has only to look at the jackets and suits we are all wearing and ask where they were made. I will tell you where they were made: in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This jacket that I am wearing was made by Crombie, a local textile firm in my town in England; it is a good, English suit. I do not know where the cloth came from, but it was the skills of British workers and those of the textile industry in Europe that took a low-quality commodity product and transformed it into a high-quality, high-value product – that is the future for the textile industry. Different parts of the textile industry will find different routes, some more technical than others, some craft-related; some will go in other directions. That is the future for our industry. This should be the message going out to the industry from the Commission White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be sure that when the Commission acts, our textile and clothing sector – much of it being made up of small companies – is able to invest in new technology and production techniques. It must be able to find ways to add value to the basic products that we may be importing from elsewhere. We must also – and this is a point which has not been previously mentioned – protect our industry from counterfeiting. This has become increasingly vital. Counterfeiting is a very serious issue for high-value, quality products, and is an issue we must address. I see no reference to this at all in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if we get it right for the textile industry, we can learn some very important lessons for other industrial sectors. We should also be looking at leather goods and footwear, and using textiles as an industrial sector flagship that can lead the way in this new century, with European workers able to earn a living from producing high-value, quality products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares your concerns about this question and is taking the necessary steps to deal with them. In view of these major challenges that face us in the textiles and clothing sector and which will remain for some years to come, in particular, as you have stressed, the effect of abolishing import quotas on 1 January 2005, the Commission has re-examined its policies and instruments in order to identify measures or lines of action that might make the textiles and clothing sector more competitive. These are reflected in the communication to which you have drawn attention, the one on the future of the textiles and clothing sector adopted by the Commission on 29 October 2003 and welcomed at a Council meeting on competitiveness on 27 November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Union’s strategy for international trade and for Doha is to seek reciprocity for textiles and clothing. Together, these policies and measures seek to give the industry and those working in the sector a clear, predictable and coherent framework that will make it easy to plan strategies and investments in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the support for these initiatives and ideas contained in the resolution on the future of the textiles sector that Parliament will shortly be adopting. The Commission will look closely at the new ideas mentioned in the text of the resolution. Some of the recommendations contained in the communication could be followed by concrete proposals within a relatively short space of time. For the rest, some of the communication’s ideas and suggestions require further investigation before being translated into action.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to assist the Commission in these investigations and in following up these matters, it will be putting in place a high level group whose task will be to formulate recommendations for improving the conditions of competitiveness. The purpose of this high level group will be to contribute to the process of implementing industrial and commercial policies in the textiles and clothing sector of the enlarged Union. The group will be involved in the Commission services’ regular monitoring of the sector’s economic development. It will provide reports and recommendations to the Commission and other players taking decisions on the proposed initiative in order to help the sector adjust to the various challenges facing it. Those reports will have to include recommendations on the key issues affecting competition in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The high level group will be made up of commissioners, ministers, heads of undertakings and directors general or presidents of federations involved in the textiles and clothing sector. It will look after innovation, research and development. I was pleased that you stressed the role of research and development in this respect. In fact, I recently had the opportunity to visit a textile undertaking which has made considerable efforts in research and innovation and has become competitive on the Chinese market as a result, although it was in a difficult position a few years ago. With a much more effective patent on dyeing and more mechanisms for managing productivity, it has become competitive in a very precise niche. The services also tell us that exports to China increase when there are these new industrial capacities. It is therefore clear that there is a future when we develop this research and innovation in a field where we have know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">Another topic is the question of intellectual property. Mr Berenguer Fuster is quite right when he says that this question must clearly form the basis of our thinking on the international level because these new processes can all be fragile if we do not protect them with solid patents. Research and development is certainly an important factor. We are also considering setting up a technology platform on the textiles sector, with the main players.</p>
<p class="contents">The other subjects are education and training, and regional policy. You stressed the problem of the Structural Funds in this connection, Mrs Bastos. In proposing the new mechanisms for the Structural Funds, my colleague Mr Barnier says very clearly that they will have to make an even greater contribution than in the past to the process of growth, the ‘Lisbon’ process. In sectors like textiles, the next Structural Funds will attach greater priority and importance to research, innovation and training, if that is what the regions want, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">International cooperation, labelling and other commerce-related subjects may all have an effect on the impact.</p>
<p class="contents">This high level group will start work in February 2004, that is virtually tomorrow, looking in particular at the objectives and the expected results, and will be followed by at least two plenary sessions before July 2004. The Commission will present its first report on the group’s work to the Council in July 2004. I think proper account is being taken of the problem. The European institutions and the Member States will be kept informed of the group’s work and of the implementation of its conclusions. The Commission is aware of the need to move quickly, since it wants to implement all of it before the end of 2004. By the end of February the Commission will draw up a list of the various trade proposals, measures and actions resulting from the communication, giving a timetable for their implementation. This will be shared with Parliament and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mentioned, Mrs Bastos, the question of the budget to be used for the implementation of the measures proposed in the Commission communication. Our intention is to use existing Community programmes and investments to implement the specific measures adopted, since we have to move quickly. Each specific measure will be implemented by the appropriate Commission services responsible for the field in question, using its own budget. I can tell you that the field of research and calls for proposals under the framework programme offer potential for interesting projects and I think that also applies in other sectors. I believe I have demonstrated how interested the Commission and Parliament are in this strategic sector for our economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
