<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dybkjær (ELDR) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> In May, the EU and UN held the third conference on the least developed countries here in Strasbourg. It was a good conference in the sense that the right words were said, but there is also cause for some despair when we look at the realities. These are, namely, that, since 1971, when the UN recognised the term ‘least developed’, the number of the least developed countries has grown from 25 to 49 today. Only one country, Botswana, has managed to struggle out of the ranks of the least developed countries. The gap between the world’s rich and poor has grown. In 1960, 20% of the world population in the richest countries had an income that was 30 times higher than that of the 20% poorest. In 1997, it was 74 times as high, and the figure is undoubtedly even higher today.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many reasons why the least developed countries are in such a poor situation: rising population growth, illiteracy, untenable debt, environmental destruction, natural catastrophes and diseases such as HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, unstable political conditions and a growing number of violent conflicts make it difficult to create long-term development plans. However, neither is it any use denying that, despite many resolutions to increase development aid by 0.7%, the reality is that development aid is 0.23% of gross domestic product. It is slightly better in the case of the EU, where it is 0.34%.</p>
<p class="contents">The removal of customs barriers in respect of the developing countries, which will help these countries, is progressing slowly. This was most recently illustrated in connection with Commissioner Lamy’s proposal, which was based on the Member States’ deferring the organisation of the market in sugar, especially with the support of the European sugar producers. In connection with the transfer of technology, private enterprise was intransigent in the fight against Aids, private enterprises only entering into a compromise with South Africa following fierce pressure, and now we are seeing exactly the same thing with regard to malaria – namely that enterprises do not have enough incentive to produce a vaccine against malaria, and therefore no vaccine will be produced unless we intervene and do something extraordinary.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, there is ICT. This is a development that is creating great economic growth in the industrialised countries, but which also risks further marginalisation of the developing countries due to lack of access both to the knowledge created by virtue of this development and to the technology as such. The opportunities that this technology can provide, as well as the risk of further marginalisation, form the background to this initiative report. The main viewpoint – the sustaining argument of the report – is that ICT provides an opportunity for the developing countries to make a quantum leap. In the report, I mention a number of sectors in which ICT can be used advantageously and in which other organisations such as the UNDP and the World Bank and some of the Member States have already had good experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament here is in line with the Council which, back in 1997 asked the Commission to draw up a report on experience with ICT in development work and, in November 2000, called upon the Commission to submit a communication on ‘the digital divide’. The report on experience arrived here this spring, and the communication will hopefully arrive before the meeting of the Development Council in November 2001. The Commission believes that the ICT work must take place through mainstreaming, that is, through ICT being used in the individual projects. This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. If this development is not just to help those who are already strong, it is essential that mainstreaming be supplemented with central work so that there is a place from which initiatives can emanate, from which good advice can be obtained and where experience can be gathered, so that one does not have to start from scratch all the time and, above all, so that the right social balance in the development can be secured. Consequently, in an earlier report – namely the Gemelli report – in March of this year, the European Parliament also asked the Commission to give this area greater priority, possibly as part of the transport priority. The Commission has stood by its previous approach, but I cannot emphasise enough that this is not sufficient. This report therefore contains a proposal for an <span class="italic">e</span>-development unit. Without such a unit, it will be impossible to ensure that there is knowledge to ensure that ICT is incorporated in the right way into the work of the Commission. However, it is of course not only ICT that must be used in the context of the aid we provide. There is also a need for private enterprises. The shining example from other areas is the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which started micro loans for women – in the first instance in the agricultural sector, but later expanding to encompass other areas as well. A similar commitment within ICT is imperative. There are some that are in progress and more should be given further impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be nice to see a global social commitment on the part of enterprises, and this can easily be combined with general earnings. Finally, Mr President: ICT is always emphasised as the technology that can liberate people. It would be nice to be able to see that that also applies to people in the developing countries. In view of our experiences with the oil and pharmaceuticals industries, it would be good if enterprises could become a shining example into the bargain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have made many statements in this Parliament and have adopted many measures in favour of the least-developed countries, aware of the importance of removing the barriers separating the rich countries from the poor countries, but, as the rapporteur has reminded us, these barriers, rather than being reduced, are actually increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">If we bear in mind the great potential of the information technologies for the future development of our society, there is no doubt that this gap is going to increase. We will thereby prevent the developing countries from overcoming the poverty threshold within which they live, and from benefiting from the numerous possibilities which the information society offers, not only for economic development, but also in the fields of health, training and many others.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that, according to current estimates, at the end of 2000 there were 700 million people ‘on-line’ in the world while, on the other hand, 2 billion people had never spoken on the telephone. Hence the need to ensure that developing countries have access to the information society and benefit from those future projects which it represents.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this report is so important and above all why it is so important that the European Union adopts a vigorous initiative so that developing countries may really be included in the wealth society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

E-europe, e-learning, e-commerce, e-business are on everyone's lips, and are increasingly setting the political agenda. But what about ‘e-development’? There is no doubt that the targeted use of modern electronic information and communication technologies can open up completely new perspectives for developing countries in particular. Of course, it would be wrong to raise false hopes by presenting ICT as a panacea. However, there is no disputing that in many countries of the Southern hemisphere, there is the potential – and the will – to bridge the digital divide. The developing countries themselves have an urgent interest in doing so, and I can only say that the response to my general report on this issue in the ACP/EU Assembly was extremely positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The task is to put the developing countries on the net as they move towards the knowledge and information society. This requires a targeted strategy. Our question is this: where is the European Dot-Force – similar to the agreement adopted at the G8 Summit – to promote the developing countries' access to global communications? The European Commission gives its admittedly rather tentative support to one or two projects, but this cannot obscure the fact that there is still no targeted strategy to support the developing countries moving towards the knowledge and information society.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the report before us is to remedy this situation. I am confident that we will be able to engage in fruitful dialogue with the Commission on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me underline the following points. ICT must take on a key role in development cooperation as well. We have therefore proposed to the Commission that an appropriately staffed ‘development unit’ be set up to undertake continuous work in this area. It is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that qualified personnel are available so that we are equipped to deal with all future challenges. Our aim must be to enable the developing countries to share fully in the opportunities afforded by the information society and utilise all available technical options for this purpose. We have already moved closer to this goal: mobile telephony, for example, is ideally suited to cover Africa's vast open spaces. Solar powered telephone transmission cells on village squares, like Internet access, no longer need to be grid-bound and dependent on electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">New information technologies can also strengthen the links between the people and the state. They can help to improve healthcare, training and education, culture and the environment. They are certainly capable of conveying detailed information on these issues. However, this also requires rules, and I wish to conclude by making that quite clear. Here, too, we must work together with the developing countries to ensure that rules are adopted which enhance the social benefits of the new technologies and are not simply targeted to commercial gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At first glance, the answer is no. After all, the fight against poverty is the main issue. If one fights for one’s daily bread, one will not be concerned with <span class="italic">e</span>-mail. In order to develop, however, it is necessary to have economic growth, and hence competitiveness, and developing countries will lose this competitive battle if the digital divide with the rich countries is widening rather than narrowing. That should not happen. In addition, there is the threat that, in poor countries, the distance between the informed elite and the population will lead to greater power inequality than is already the case. If anything could benefit the spread of information and power, or democratisation in a word, then it is the ICT revolution. That is why a European strategy must be developed. Mrs Dybkjær has drafted an excellent report on this matter. The public and private sectors are both crucial in this. The government is vital for drafting sound legislation, for administrative guidance and promotion. ICT will need to be included in the sector programmes, and a strategic selection of target groups will need to be made. These are primarily the most important government bodies, but also education and health care could become far more efficient by using the new technologies. In addition, ICT can contribute to better environmental management and to saving energy. All of this will not be easy, and it will take some time but, ultimately, the new technology will prove to be vitally important in the fight against poverty and in making development possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He replied as follows: When I read that technological development and the information society need to be promoted, I have to suppress a smile. First of all, because this will only benefit a minority and an ever richer elite. Also, it is, in fact, absurd to talk about technological development and the information society in countries where even the most basic education infrastructure is not in place, especially outside the capitals. But nevertheless, he states it is a necessity if the countries want to be able to compete. In other words: the bottom-up and bottom-down strategy which Mrs Dybkjær proposes to pursue seems sensible to me. Please let us not forget, however, that people who have not had any schooling, even with the most wonderful infrastructure at their fingertips, will always be hopelessly behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the Okinawa Summit a year ago in July G8 took the view that the most central challenge facing the world at the moment is the wide gulfs between north and south in terms of technical capacity and know-how, in other words the ‘digital divide’. There are areas in the world in which a total 2 billion inhabitants have become isolated. If this gulf in technical know-how cannot be bridged, globalisation will already have failed from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur wisely stated that the development of digital know-how must not be based solely on the private sector but that the EU and other funding bodies must focus on the public sector. This is a realistic approach. The issue does not merely involve a technical problem but the combined effects of geographical isolation, poverty and disease. Therefore, the success of globalisation requires these isolated areas to be linked to the rest of the world as well as a real investment in the education and health of their inhabitants. If the situation is allowed to develop solely on the basis of market forces, there is a risk that the digital divide will widen to an unbridgeable extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Although development cooperation in recent decades has largely been correctly targeted, the media has emphasised and public opinion has been influenced by a few sad examples of tractors rusting in the fields, in other words donations given on commercial terms without understanding the situation of the recipients or ensuring that they were prepared to receive them.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely the same nightmare scenario may arise today if we don’t take care that the information society of developing countries has a healthy foundation on which it can be based. This foundation is a guaranteed right for everyone to have a basic education and a worthwhile existence. The PPE-DE Group would like the European Union to work to ensure that, with its help, all countries in the world are able to take part in adopting information technology and develop their societies. If it is possible to follow such an integrated and complementary policy in the field of information technology and telecommunications, there is hope that information technology will promote partnership and reinforce all other development cooperation carried out in these countries. This approach is successfully reflected in the report now under discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Dybkjær on her report on information and communication technologies in developing countries. It is a refreshing and stimulating report with a lot of insight and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly appreciated the efforts to put the new technologies in the context of poverty alleviation and the need to ensure that poor people profit from it. For the Commission, this is a fundamental point. Indeed, the digital divide – that is to say the unequal access to information and communication technologies among and within countries – is a reflection of existing social and economic inequalities in both industrialised and developing countries. ICT did not create inequality, but it may well fuel it unless we are conscious of its impact. On the other hand. if applied with pragmatic realism, ICT can be a useful tool for economic development, and possibly even underpin the positive evolution of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Dybkjær's report is well timed. As we all know, the G8 leaders will be meeting in July in Genoa to consider, among other things, the reports and proposals by the DOT force. MEPs will have a second opportunity to discuss ICT and development subjects at the October session of the EU–ACP Joint Assembly, on the basis of a report by Mrs Junker. The Commission, for its part, is preparing a communication, to be submitted later in the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and motion for a resolution make several proposals on the role of Community development cooperation in respect of ICT. We welcome the suggestion that we work closely with Member States' aid agencies and define a division of labour in ICT. It is indeed important to distinguish between what should be done and what the Commission needs to do. Tasks and responsibilities can be shared with Member States; this is work in which the Commission will participate, both within the G8 and with Member States, but it will not take the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, we welcome the consideration of ICT in country strategy papers. That will ensure that ICT is used in the context of a country's overall development policy and that the choice of priority sectors remains country- and not donor-driven.</p>
<p class="contents">We have some difficulties, however, with the proposal to widen the development priority areas. The joint statement of the Council and the Commission on European Community development priority policies was approved only last November. This proposal would run counter to it. The Commission has to focus its activities if it wants to deliver on its aid agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 20 and 22 call on the Commission to play a greater role in ICT and development than seems reasonable or realistic at the present moment. More fundamentally, the Commission is making a serious effort to improve its aid management and increase its poverty focus. It will take some years for changes to take effect. If we do not, however, make a serious effort to focus on a limited number of priority areas, we shall only succeed in perpetuating the current problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to consider the use of ICT within the existing priority areas and cross-cutting themes – if and when they are cost-effective in achieving stated objectives, and indeed that is increasingly the case. Adopting good governance, capacity-building, regional integration and administrative reform as focal points will, in many cases, accelerate the use of ICT as an important tool. Making specific provision for ICT within thematic budget lines would not, however, be consistent with our approach of using ICT as an integral part of our work in priority areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has reservations about the proposal to create an e-development unit within EuropeAid Cooperation Office and has created a unit for innovation with a similar mandate in mind for cross-cutting themes across the various geographical directorates, and feels that this meets its needs adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in paragraph 32 the draft resolution calls for a report in 2003. The Commission has promised to submit an annual report on Community development policy and therefore proposes to cover ICT, as appropriate, in that annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission looks forward to contributing further to debates on ICT when it presents its communication later in the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
