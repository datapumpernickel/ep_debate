It is in the interests of the European Union, in the interests of the three institutions, to do something about the fragmentation of the European financial markets and find solutions which take account of the interests of industry, investors and end-users and which, in this age of globalisation, help to stabilise the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that quicker, more efficient legislation needs to be passed in this area. All three institutions have a contribution to make here. The Wise Men’s report does not clarify how the players and institutions should interact at the various levels and therefore calls for dialogue between the European institutions, hence our questions to the Commission and the Council, because the European Parliament is not sure how the institutional balance can be guaranteed in the European Union within this sort of proposal. We have formulated our proposals on this basis and we expect replies from the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, unlike in most Member States or the USA, the Treaty makes no provision for secondary legislation, not least because there is no executive body at Community level to which such powers can be delegated. And, unlike national parliaments, the European Parliament has no right of initiative. The comitology procedure proposed by the Council and in the report will certainly need to be supplemented, in order to establish a balance between the institutions, if there is to be a fast-track procedure. This means that, if a clear correlation between political and technical matters is created within framework legislation, technical implementing powers and powers to adapt to technological progress will need to be decided as quickly as possible and backed up by giving the European Parliament a clear callback right if anyone acts <span class="italic">ultra vires </span>or fails to abide by the transparency rule, for example, during the consultation process. Finally, the Lamfalussy report, like the European Parliament, attaches great importance to an absolutely transparent procedure in precisely this legislative area.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that, with good will on the part of the Council and the Commission, this callback right could be included by simply amending the 1999 comitology decision to include the eventuality that, if the European Parliament feels that the Securities Committee has acted <span class="italic">ultra vires</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>this must be rectified either by the Commission’s submitting a new proposal or by applying the normal codecision procedure in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is calling quite unequivocally for an interinstitutional agreement here which clarifies the fact that the basic principles and the clear distinction between political and technical implementing measures are regulated in the laws on a case-by-case basis. We are prepared to go along with anything which speeds things up – we can also apply the fast track procedure to the parliamentary codecision procedure – and to guarantee that there is total transparency. But I call on the Council and the Commission to give us a clear answer here today as to what plans they have for a callback right for the European Parliament or equivalent procedure because this is crucial to our democratic responsibility in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has already been a lot of informal contact between Parliament and the Council regarding this issue. I would like to take this opportunity to express the Council’s great appreciation of the work carried out on this matter by Mrs Randzio-Plath as chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It has been invaluable for the Council and the presidency to be able to discuss these issues with you on an on-going basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As you no doubt know, the ECOFIN Council discussed the proposals in the Lamfalussy report at its meeting on 12 March 2001. The Council welcomed the report, but the discussions will continue. A new ECOFIN Council meeting will take place immediately before the European Council in Stockholm. The presidency aims to reach an agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that the operation of the financial markets is of considerable significance to increased growth in the economy. This makes it even more natural to discuss this issue in conjunction with the European Council in Stockholm, one of the aims of which is to modernise the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to growth and increased employment that the financial markets be cost-effective in brokering capital between savings and investments, handling payment systems and distributing risk. At the same time, we must ensure that the markets provide good consumer protection and that they are stable.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial markets and the venture capital markets in the EU must be integrated and made more efficient. The action plans for financial services and venture capital provide a good foundation for achieving these particular targets regarding integration and efficiency. The focus is on fully implementing the action plan. In order to keep to the timetable, we must put in the efforts required now.</p>
<p class="contents">As we see it, it is therefore necessary for the institutions concerned <span class="italic">and</span> the Member States to jointly review the legislative process in the financial area and exploit its opportunities more effectively, so that important and necessary decisions can be taken more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that the Community legislation regulating the securities market <span class="italic">must</span> contain a measure of flexibility in order to address development and create a competitive common market which is receptive to new international trends. The legislative process must be speeded up, but the limits of the Treaty must, of course, be respected. This can and must be achieved while, at the same time, fully respecting the provisions of the Treaty, the rights of the institutions concerned and the existing balance between them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council largely supports the four levels which the Committee of Wise Men proposes in order to make the regulation process more flexible within the framework of the current Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to comment today on the operational details of the future European Securities Committee. I would just like to emphasise that, as I have said, the Council and Member States are aware of the need to speed up the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedures proposed by the Committee of Wise Men for decisions at what are referred to as Level 1 and Level 2 are not actually new. They are based on existing options, i.e. on the comprehensive legislative procedure and on implementation through comitology. Therefore, the basic rules and the effects of these with regard to the issues taken up by Mrs Randzio-Plath in her question are familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath wonders how the Council proposes to be able to guarantee balance in the codecision procedure and a large degree of openness. The legal framework with regard to delegating implementation powers is clear in respect of the Treaty, the Council’s 1999 comitology decision, legal practice in the European Court of Justice and the decisions of the legislature when it delegates implementation powers in each particular case. In this regard, the Council and the European Parliament already follow established rules. We are all obliged to follow this legal framework. The codecision procedure enables us to decide jointly for each individual act what will be delegated to comitology and according to which rules. Through the new framework decision of 1999, Parliament is also guaranteed a greater role than ever before, with a large degree of openness also guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">This new openness benefits, and is important to, the European Parliament, as well as the general public. The European Parliament is guaranteed always to be kept fully informed about the work of the Securities Committee and to receive all documentation linked to it: agendas, proposals for measures, results of votes, minutes of meetings and attendance lists. If Parliament believes that the draft measures put forward by the Commission exceed the implementation powers in the basic instrument, the Commission should immediately re-examine these measures, taking into account as far as possible Parliament’s resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">An independent Regulators’ Committee will act as an advisory group to the Commission when drawing up draft implementation measures for the framework principles. For this system to work properly, all the institutions concerned must act in good faith and respect the fundamental conditions for the strategy at various levels as proposed in the report by the Committee of Wise Men.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath further urges me to ensure that the Securities Committee does not intervene to make major changes to or block implementation regulations proposed by the Commission and to provide political assurance with regard to the Council’s willingness to speed up its procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise the basic constitutional difference between the Council as an institution and a committee for comitology, which comprises representatives of the Member States themselves, and not of the Council. This difference is important and, as everyone knows, forms the basis for the whole structure of the comitology. I would like to stress that the Securities Committee’s main task will be to assist the Commission in exercising the powers delegated to it in accordance with the procedure for decisions on comitology. With regard to the Council, I would like to repeat my previous comment that all institutions concerned will need to act in good faith and respect the fundamental conditions in the report by the Committee of Wise Men.</p>
<p class="contents">The structure proposed in the Lamfalussy report respects the codecision procedure and the institutional symmetry set out in the Treaty. Therefore the Council believes that there is no need for a further institutional framework in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the ECOFIN Council has a positive attitude towards the idea of establishing an interinstitutional monitoring system to evaluate the development towards an integrated financial market and to identify bottlenecks. Regular reports could be presented to the European Parliament and the Council as part of this monitoring process. In addition, the extensive and open review proposed for 2004 will make it possible for us to assess how the system works and remedy any deficiencies.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, on 12 March, the ECOFIN Council welcomed the report and the proposed strategy of four levels and made good progress in setting the general rules for solving institutional and organisational issues which may arise from the strategy. However, some questions remain regarding relations between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament in conjunction with particular acts and the establishment of the Regulators’ Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECOFIN Council urged continued work on these issues and I hope, as I said in my introduction, that we will be able to reach an overall solution as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that the Commission broadly supports the main thrust of the report of the Committee of Wise Men, chaired by Mr Lamfalussy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the integration of security markets by 2005, the Commission considers that Community legislation must become more efficient and flexible in order to respond rapidly to developments in financial markets. EU legislation must also be implemented swiftly and consistently, and enforced more rigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath has raised five main points on the Commission's position on the report. I should like to try to answer all five, although perhaps in a slightly different order. First, on accountability and transparency of the process, I recall that the essential elements of an act must, according to the Treaty and the jurisprudence, be defined by the legislators and therefore it will pass through the so-called Level 1 normal codecision procedure. Implementing measures, however, shall, in accordance with the comitology decision, be delegated to a Level 2 process, as is clear to any person who has read the Lamfalussy report. The Commission shares the view that it is essential that consumers and industry are fully consulted on all such implementing measures affecting them.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting directives or regulations at Level 1, the Council and Parliament will jointly define the scope of technical implementing measures by codecision, as has been stated, on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">On Level 2, the Commission is also ready to consult widely with market participants and end-users in an open and transparent way before adopting tactical implementing measures. The Commission also agrees that the European Securities Regulators' Committee should carry out a full consultation process on draft implementing measures, with the European Parliament being fully informed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission’s right of initiative, I stress that the Commission, in preparing its proposals for Level 2 technical implementing measures, looks forward to benefiting from the technical expertise that the European Union's regulators will bring – after all they are the experts in these matters. There can therefore be no question at all of the Commission's right of initiative being affected by any such advice. The Commission believes that encouraging European regulators to work in this way will also facilitate over time the convergence of regulatory structures throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the third matter raised by Mrs Randzio-Plath: the question of the symmetry of the codecision powers of the two legislative pillars and of the transparency of the Securities Committee. It seems to the Commission that such a symmetry is guaranteed by the codecision procedure provided for in Article 251 of the EC Treaty. That procedure gives Parliament the power to decide, together with the Council, on the scope of the technical implementing measures to be adopted at Level 2. Parliament must decide, together with the Council, on the difference between the general principles and the implementing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">For those measures the 1999 comitology decision – referred to earlier by the representative of the Council – confers on Parliament "the right to be informed by the Commission on a regular basis of the proceedings of the committees involved in committee procedures." In conformity with Articles 1 and 2 of the Interinstitutional Agreements on procedures for implementing the 1999 comitology decision, the Commission will send to Parliament all necessary documentation, draft measures and agendas of the European Securities Committee, as the Council representative just mentioned. The Commission is also prepared to follow the committee's recommendation that it should take the utmost account of any parliamentary resolution adopted concerning a proposal to the European Securities Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the question raised about proposals for implementing measures. If the European Securities Committee were to fail to give a positive opinion to the Commission and the Council were to oppose the measures or Parliament were to express a view that the implementing measures exceeded the delegated powers in a resolution adopted by an absolute majority – the so-called <span class="italic">ultra vires</span> case – the Commission would, following the 1999 comitology decision, re-examine its proposal. In such circumstances the Commission would be prepared, as I mentioned earlier, to take the utmost account of Parliament's position, as expressed in such a resolution. In those circumstances, and even if the European Securities Committee had already given a positive opinion on the proposed implementing measures, the comitology decision still gives the Commission the possibility of putting forward a legislative proposal on the basis of the Treaty, i.e. through codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, however, convinced that all sides will have major incentives to make this system work. It is willing to work with the Council and Parliament within the scope of the Treaty and of the comitology decision to clarify any outstanding points. Furthermore, the proposed interinstitutional monitoring committee – on which, of course, this Parliament will be represented – will have a significant role in ensuring all of this. Finally, on this point, there will be a full review of the whole process in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, and before I answer the questions put by Mrs Randzio-Plath, the Commission's fundamental objective in the securities field is to create an integrated European financial market through the completion of the financial services action plan, and the sooner the better.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that substantial long-term benefits will flow from that objective. To deliver it, the Commission considers that Community legislation must become more efficient and flexible in order to respond rapidly to developments in financial markets. As the Council representative also stressed, legislation must be delivered in a way which is in conformity with the Treaty and with the 1999 comitology decision. All interested parties will have to be satisfied and have an adequate role within the limits of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I know I shall have the chance at the end of the debate to provide some additional comments, but I should like to reply to some remarks made by Mrs Randzio-Plath.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed the Commission welcomes very much the positive attitude shown by Mrs Randzio-Plath, as chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, vis-à-vis the report of the Committee of Wise Men under the chairmanship of Mr Lamfalussy. She said that every effort must be made to speed the process up – and the Commission totally agrees with her opinion – otherwise we shall be adopting yesterday's measures for tomorrow's developments. She also said – and here again we concur – that the procedures must be absolutely transparent, and the report of Mr Lamfalussy and his colleagues is very clear on this. Once again, there is a monitoring committee on which, as I have said, Parliament will be represented, to monitor this whole process. If there is insufficient transparency, then no doubt the monitoring committee will make the appropriate observations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in the case that Parliament should adopt by majority vote the opinion that the Commission has acted <span class="italic">ultra vires</span>, then once again the Commission agrees with the Lamfalussy report in saying that it will take utmost account of Parliament's opinion and act accordingly. That is an important safeguard for Parliament to see that it is not bypassed by any sleight-of-hand. So, there again, we can reassure Mrs Randzio-Plath. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of Parliament’s order of business, on which this and other reports are entered for this morning, I promised to discuss the European economy with voters in my constituency in one hour’s time. I should therefore like to apologise in advance for being unable to stay until the end of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a few comments on the Wise Men’s proposal, but I shall start by thanking Baron Lamfalussy for his highly intelligent and far-reaching report on this subject and then take a position on the first part of this report, i.e. on the question of a fast-track procedure. The real issue here is that we want to fast track the passage and application of this important legislative package. And we have here an initial opportunity where the European Parliament has already stated that it is prepared, if at all possible and if the Council meets us half way here, to complete the legislative procedures at first reading. So if we can agree at first reading, then the European Parliament will be prepared to refrain from tabling any further proposed amendments at second reading. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be a good idea if we were to select two very important pilot projects here, such as the regulations on pension funds, which are crucial, and a simpler issue such as the regulations on prospectuses in the European Union, and use these projects to see exactly what happens here if we shift legislation to a secondary level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a word on the question of whether democracy costs time. Time and again we hear that Parliament’s being allowed a possible three readings to deal with a question extends the legislative procedure unnecessarily. I cannot agree with that. Think back to the old days of unanimity, when the legislative procedure in the European Union took up to 20 years. There are quite specific examples of this, such as the product liability directive. Experience has shown that we are able to complete important legislative procedures in two years with the new codecision procedure. I think this shows that it is possible to have a democratic procedure which does not take an overly long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the second question, i.e. the implementation of legislation in the European Union. We agree with the Wise Men’s proposal on most points, unlike the Council, which has reservations. However, as the European Parliament, we unanimously demand a callback right in cases in which we feel that errors have been made in implementing the legislation. This too is a unanimous call and will shortly be adopted in the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such unanimity within our committee is worth underlining as it is a rare occurrence and should encourage the Commission and the Council to look very closely at the arguments put forward by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would next like to thank Alexandre Lamfalussy, who worked patiently and intelligently at the head of the Committee of Wise Men. He listened to the European Parliament and the vast majority of his proposals were sensible, useful and even necessary to achieve proper regulation of the European securities markets and to create a genuine market in this area. Be that as it may, the report by Mr Lamfalussy had a mitigated reception, both in the ECOFIN Council and in the European Parliament, to the extent that some of his proposals threatened the interinstitutional balance. Mrs Randzio-Plath has already spoken about this so I will not go over it again. I am fully aware of the need to legislate more rapidly, especially in the interest of the development of European financial markets. The problem lies, above all, in the Securities Committee, which would adopt the Commission’s proposals according to the Council’s voting rules. We are told that these are not decisions relating to technical subjects and Mr Danielsson reminded us of the difference between the Council of Ministers and a regulatory committee. Why, then, mobilise Secretaries of State for ostensibly technical rules? What is more, these Secretaries of State must vote according to Council rules. Who can explain to me to what extent Secretaries of State, working under the direction of their respective ministries, will be able to legislate more quickly than the ECOFIN Council? That does not make much sense and I believe that, if we really want to work faster, we can do so. Mr von Wogau has pointed out a few ways to achieve this. I will not repeat them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliament wants a right to recall, which exists in many countries and also in the United States. It is a safeguard clause in the interest of the markets. I am sure that, if this safeguard clause, this right to recall, existed, Parliament would probably not use it very often. In any event, it is a guarantee against the anti-democratic practices of a committee which sits behind closed doors and takes decisions without Parliament being able to intervene. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to come to the nub of the issue here before us. I am not reassured by the assurances of the Council and the Commission that we in Parliament are fully looked after in this process. Of course, we must respect the treaties. Of course, we must understand the difference between primary law and secondary legislation as referred to in Lamfalussy. And of course, we have as a potential point of departure the June 1999 interinstitutional agreement on comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">We stand at a special moment where we can seize an opportunity as institutions together to creatively pursue something that we have failed miserably to do so far. There is a long list of blockages noted by Lamfalussy and they are primarily the blockages of the Council of Ministers. There is a long list of failures to implement and they are primarily a responsibility for the Commission as guardian of the Treaty to enforce. There is no point in going back to the past when we can seize this moment to create a much better future without delay in terms of a single financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we have rights in the primary legislation. We have the right, as has been said, to define the scope of the legislation and of the derogated powers to the regulators and securities committees. But there is a feedback system in this. Will we give them a millimetre or a metre? A metre or a kilometre? I will tell you – we will dole it out in accordance with our view of its democratic scrutiny, its balance, its parallelism between the legislative institutions and its accountability. If you want speed and substance, if you want, Commissioner and Council, the flexibility to give tomorrow's solutions to tomorrow's problems, and not to yesterday's problems, then we need to give these committees a wide latitude but be able to call back, if necessary, on reflection. No callback – no wide latitude. We have a big choice to make. What are we pursuing here? It is not simply a closed loop. In the primary round we get to decide how wide is the secondary discretion and how wide it will be. It will partly depend on how open and democratic is it and how balanced it is in terms of the two legislative arms of this Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the bit of the debate that has not mentioned its name. Even as the Council sits here and – if I might say even with due deference to all the politeness of the Minister – throws the book at us and says, "There is a treaty; there is a procedure. We will inform you, we will send you the minutes, but otherwise please go away," I do not accept that message. I want to know from the Council as you give us that message why do you or at least some Member States go through the back door and use annexes, attached for other reasons on sensitive issues, to the June 1999 decision and make up new comitology rules for yourselves to jump from qualified majority de facto to simply majority as leverage on the European Commission. This is not acceptable. There should be not two rules but one rule, one democracy, one openness.</p>

Moreover, the mandate given to the Wise Men referred to the method, whilst the political debate on the aims and the substance of regulation and political control is still far from over.</p>
<p class="contents">To create a European financial market could be a move in the wrong direction because of the finances of unstable and discriminatory markets or an obsession with financial assets. However, the exercise may turn out to be positive if it is a question of pooling resources to develop a productive system, social cohesion or inter-generation solidarity. However, who can say that we are actually preparing that? It is not the European Parliament that is slowing things down. The Member States have said yes to a pan-European financial market, but they have not bothered to consider its impact. They have not developed a strategy and have come up against a great deal of administrative opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee of Wise Men had to propose an extremely complicated procedure which was typically intergovernmental, whilst a method giving powers of initiative to the European Parliament with the establishment of a European regulator who was equipped with a clear mandate would have certainly succeeded in an effective, acceptable and rapid fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have a method which is totally inappropriate. This is what we are saying today in unanimity with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. We want at least a power of recall, which would enable us to control this extremely bureaucratic procedure, which is slipping from our grasp. We demand that this challenge be brought within reach of public opinion. Once again, it is a question of democratic choice.</p>
