<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ferrer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, the European textile and clothing sector is currently being battered by massive and abnormally cheap imports from economic areas that are either in the grip of a serious recession or whose own traditional markets have been closed to them. This is what is happening with the countries of South‐East Asia, Central Asia, the former Soviet republics and the Baltic republics. In addition to this, there is the unprecedented increase of imports from Turkey due to the closure of the Russian market and Turkey"s industrial capacity, which has expanded dramatically over the past five years.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of such massive imports, which scarcely cover the cost of the raw material, many European textile companies are currently recording losses and their survival is threatened. This is seriously jeopardising a number of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The unfair competition faced by this sector – a sector that includes the production of fibres, threads and cloth and also the finished products – is getting worse. And it is getting worse because of the tariff and non‐tariff barriers, as all the rules established within the World Trade Organisation prevent the sector from having access to the markets of countries such as India, the United States or even Turkey. It is as if these rules only applied to the Community"s markets, which these countries and their products can access freely.</p>
<p class="contents">This imbalance is heightened by the vast array of preferential agreements that the Union has already signed, or is about to sign, with third countries, at a time when the announcement of a new round of multilateral negotiations is casting a doubt over the advisability of these bilateral agreements. The result of the combination of these negative elements is that European businessmen in the textile sector feel that there was little use in investing significantly, as they did, in high technology and ambitious restructuring to modernise their business and in specialising in quality, fashion, design and the European trade mark.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite having taken steps to be able to successfully meet the challenge of international competitiveness, the textile sector does not have the weapons it needs to defend itself when faced with unfair competition. For this reason, I would urge the Commission to adopt whatever measures are necessary to put an end to the unfair competition to which this sector is subjected. In this way, we could guarantee full compliance with the commitments made by all the parties in the framework of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking specifically of the trade defence instruments available to the European Union to eliminate trade barriers affecting Community products. I am also thinking of the safeguard measures provided for in the Uruguay Round agreements, which the Commission should perhaps adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the resolution on the Commission"s communication on the textile and clothing sector, and in the actual plan of action that the Commission then drew up, there is already a series of proposals along these lines. What is happening is that these proposals are not materialising, and if they are not urgently promoted, an large part of a sector which is firmly established in European industry and which, above all, provides many jobs, could disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, I would ask you to tell Commissioner Brittan how urgent it is to adopt measures to protect our textiles sector in a fair and faithful manner. On the one hand, this protection should be justified and should comply with some of the provisions and requirements set out in the rules of the World Trade Organisation. On the other hand, it should come under the legislation that the European Union itself has drawn up to govern its trade with third countries and with developing countries. I hope that the Commission will bear this in mind and will address this problem which affects so many jobs.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Moniz </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, during the parliamentary term now drawing to a close, we have frequently discussed textiles and clothing. There has certainly been proportionately more talk than action. Nevertheless, some positive things have been achieved, above all as regards the Commission"s approach to this sector. Previously, the textiles and clothing sector were viewed with suspicion, being regarded as uncompetitive and the province of third world countries. That is to say, it was regarded as a marginal sector doomed to fade away because of an attitude of conformism and fatalist determinism which would inevitably lead to millions of workers losing their jobs, just when the European Union had chosen to give priority to the fight against unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">As discussion and analysis of the situation has progressed, there has been a significant change in the attitude towards textiles. Fortunately, this sector has come to be viewed as one of the most competitive and innovative, and it has been recognised that it is one of the most labour‐intensive sectors and is therefore potentially an effective tool in the fight against unemployment. I personally am satisfied that I have to some extent been able to contribute to this new perception of the textiles and clothing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">But many things still need to be put on a firm footing. The plan of action announced should not just remain on paper as a list of good intentions. The specific support measures needed for SMEs should be progressed without delay. The European Union should be firm in calling for strict compliance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation and the Textile Agreement, in particular the timetable for liberalisation, controls on dumping and fraudulent practices, access to third country markets and restrictions on bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, five years ago I started my membership of the European Parliament by raising the problems of the textiles and clothing sector. I am concluding my participation in this final part‐session of the European Parliament on the same subject, more convinced than ever of the need to defend this sector and more confident about its future. In my own country, where this sector accounts for 25 % of jobs in processing industries and 30 % of exports, where there are regions that are almost entirely dependent on it, with a consequent impact on the life of most families, thousands of workers and employers are viewing the future with hope and anticipation, but also with many doubts and fears. We must show ourselves worthy of their confidence, dedication and hard work, and their willingness to continue demonstrating their faith by investing in a sector which involves risk but undeniably has a future as an integral part of the Europe of social responsibility and solidarity that we wish to see.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> I should like to reply to the questions by Mrs Ferrer and Mrs Peijs, and by Mr Chanterie and Mr Moniz.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question regarding recent imports of textiles from third countries into Europe, the Commission is in contact with the European textiles and clothing industry on this issue. The European industry believes that recent imports from a number of third countries, especially from Asia, were made at very low prices. On 3 May, representatives of the European industry met with my colleague Sir Leon Brittan to explain the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">At present the Commission is in the process of establishing, together with the industry, the facts regarding import flows and prices. Once the facts have been established the best course of action can be determined. If it shows that there have been unfair trade practices such as dumping or subsidisation causing injury to the European industry, the European anti‐dumping and anti‐subsidies legislation provides for means to deal with this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting of 3 May Sir Leon Brittan assured the European industry that if there was evidence of such unfair trade practices the Commission would examine very seriously any complaint made by the industry. It would then take appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the situation under the relevant international agreements, we have to keep in mind the following. Firstly, for WTO members, the agreement on textiles and clothing (the ATC) already provides for quantitative restrictions on imports from a number of third countries, including countries in South‐east Asia. The Commission ensures that these limits are respected, and there is no evidence that the recent imports have exceeded the quantitative ceilings. In addition, the ATC provides for a transitional safeguard instrument. According to this agreement new quantitative restrictions can be introduced when it can be demonstrated that increased imports seriously damage the domestic industry or threaten to do so. These actions are subsequently scrutinised in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for a number of non‐WTO members, bilateral textiles agreements fix quantitative limits. In addition, for imports that are not under quota, reference ceilings are set. These are percentage limits of the previous year's imports as a share of total Union imports. Once these reference ceilings are reached the imposition of a new quantitative limit may be requested.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in response to the question regarding the positions expressed by third countries in preparation for the forthcoming round of the WTO negotiations, I would like to say the following. Some developing countries which are WTO members would indeed be interested in amending the agreement on textiles and clothing in order to speed‐up the liberalisation of all quantitative restrictions, presently due to be completed on 1 January 2005. Nevertheless the Commission does not advocate this idea. Such an acceleration of the liberalisation timetable would also cause immense difficulties for the second major textiles importer, the United States.</p>

That is why we have withdrawn our motion.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, we are returning to an issue that we have dealt with on previous occasions. We are calling for positive action from the Commission to ensure that international trade practices relating to products of the textile industry are dealt with appropriately. We are trying to ensure that trade is conducted in accordance with the rules agreed on in the respective international agreements applied by the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adapted our position not only on the textiles industry but also on the European system of production in general in order to respond to the need for the sector to accept the conditions of a global economy and to work to increase its productivity and competitiveness. It must be restructured so that our products and services are sufficiently accepted in a global economy to enable them participate fully in the international markets. As a result of this increased competitiveness, European industry and services will be able to grow and will therefore also be able to create more jobs. This is the general approach we are also applying to the textile industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our position is not a protectionist one. It is a position that will allow us to comply fully with the agreed international trade practices. The events of recent months, particularly in Asia – which Commissioner Gradin mentioned – are of great concern since the very positive effort made by the textile industry to become more modern and competitive and to have the best possible position and share of the international market may be ruined in a very short space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Massive imports under inadequate conditions from various areas, including Asia, could ruin the industry"s opportunities. These imports worry us and I welcome Mrs Gradin"s specific comment on this matter. I must stress that this industry has made considerable efforts to adapt. What is more, it would be unfair to put at risk one of the industries that creates most jobs in the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Souchet </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am very pleased that my last speech in this parliamentary term relates to an important sector, the European clothing and textile industry, which has a predominantly female workforce, a large number of SMEs, often in rural areas, and a future which is largely dependent on the application of fair trading rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of any positive measures by the Commission, whose action plan to make the sector more competitive we examined in 1998 but has not been followed up in practice, some Member States such as France, Spain and Portugal have taken steps to curb the exodus of jobs to third countries. In France, a textile sector plan which reduced the social charges that were a burden on wages has enabled 35 000 jobs to be saved, not to mention indirect employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission then decided to get tough, not against those countries which refused to introduce social and environmental clauses in world trade rules, but against the Member States. It considered that reductions in social charges could distort competition between European producers, and it declared France"s textile sector plan to be illegal, demanded impossible repayments from firms and blocked the extension of this job‐saving measure to other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach needs to be changed. We should only allow into the Union products from third countries where operators comply with the ILO social rules relating to working conditions, working hours and child labour, until such time as the Union applies these rules as part of the package of international agreements it is negotiating and, in particular, the WTO negotiating rounds. It is unfair competition against European businesses that the Commission should be attacking, not the Union"s own firms.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would refer to the concern generated by Mr Prodi"s first statements on this subject, which suggested that he has a very ideological notion of competition and regards any regulating or corrective measures taken by a Member State as tantamount to distorting competition.

<p class="contents">I support this <span class="italic">cri de coeur</span> from the Europe textile industry. Europe is a big market but it is not a dumping ground and Mrs Ferrer has made a very good case. Mr Moniz also talked about fraudulent practices. Let me tell you one. A country which had the right to import shirts but not piece‐good textiles got round the rules by importing shirts with tails 15 metres long – and they got away with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe may lead in the textile fashion industry but we must have a basic manufacturing industry in order to support it. Europe may well lead also in the design and techniques of textile machinery but there again we need to have a home market for such products. I mention friction‐spinning, which was as a fairly recent invention in Europe. Instead of using it to make textiles more profitable for Europe we actually sold the technique abroad. We made the profit of our invention once.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to support developing nations by having bilateral treaties with them in order that they can have a market for their goods. I have no quarrel with that at all, but if we are going to have these bilaterals the Commission should be called upon to draw the lines very clearly and make sure they are properly controlled.</p>

When sectors are in crisis, we must always ensure that we take the right measures in good time. It is crucial that we should prepare for the WTO negotiating round in Seattle, and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I have always insisted that we should clearly identify the salient points here and that our main concern is access to third markets. We must specifically ensure that these markets are opened up to us and that fair conditions are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to consider incentives in export marketing. We must see to it that firms are able to offer their goods internationally so that Europe can be presented as a powerful force. Another very important point is that we must ensure that a lighter burden is placed on SMEs in particular. This is an issue to which I personally am very committed. We have more than 16 million SMEs in the European Union, and they need to be given greater help and consideration here in the House in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I am the last speaker, I should also like to thank the President and his team, who have always worked so very hard here on Fridays. I should also like to thank the President of the European Parliament, Mr Gil‐Robles, for taking my initiatives to eliminate crime in and around the European institutions very seriously; our group chairman Mr Martens for promising not to forget this issue in future in Belgium and to continue to support us; the President‐in‐Office for promising to devote his efforts to this; and finally the Quaestors and the Conference of Presidents, for whom this issue has now become genuinely topical. I am looking forward to seeing a safer Europe in the next parliamentary term.</p>

The fact that the European institutions include a Parliament, with all its defects and all its problems, is something that the people of Europe should begin to value. The fact that this Parliament has become a fundamental element of the Community mechanism during this term must be valued. I believe that our task now in the coming weeks must be to convince the people of Europe of how important their participation in the elections is to this Parliament. And I believe that at least those Members who are here today have done everything possible to ensure that our work is not trivial, but that it is important and definitive work in the process of European integration.</p>

It was always a great pleasure to round off a long and difficult sitting – and I was often there at the end, though not always – with a joke, and I hope that the spirit which you have stood for and which several people have reflected in their speeches will continue in the next Parliament. It will be in a different building which will not be as homely; the light will be colder, I think, but I hope that the pleasure, the vision, the cooperation and the humour will remain.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to thank you for being in the Chair for almost all the Friday sittings. I regard Friday as a normal working day just like all the rest, and I am extremely sorry that so many of our colleagues are notoriously absent. I have attended every Friday sitting for the past ten years, and if I return – I do not know whether I will, because in my country the people decide, not the parties – I shall maintain the same discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank you for being so generous with speaking time. We have sometimes been allowed to have the floor for half or even a whole minute more than the minute officially allocated, so I would thank you most sincerely and hope to see you here again – because you are sure to be re‐elected – not just on Fridays, but on all sitting days.</p>

This morning Mrs Schleicher, who is also a member of the Friday club, said in the Chair at the beginning of the sitting ‘The Rules of Procedure also apply to the Conference of Presidents". This has inspired me to thank you for being a vice‐president who has always stood up for the rights of individual Members. The Friday club itself consists of people who stand up for the rights of Members, and I very much hope that we will be able to continue to work together on this in the next parliamentary term.</p>

<p class="contents">Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As this is the last sitting in this parliamentary term, I would propose to the House that we derogate from Rule 133(2) and approve the Minutes of the current sitting now. They have been drafted as the debates have taken place. If there are no comments, that is how we shall proceed.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The Minutes were approved) </span></p><p class="contents"><a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our work. As you are all aware, I usually thank Parliament"s services for their help during the sittings on behalf of all of you and I am sure I reflect your feelings in doing so. Today, such thanks must be of a special nature. It is not the last time they will be thanked but it is the end of an era.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know that in order to weave a basket to hold our political activity, we need many willow branches and these branches are the officials who help us. Therefore, allow me, albeit briefly, to express my thanks to the various groups involved, beginning with the ushers. The ushers, ladies and gentlemen, achieve a marvellous mix of discretion and service without any degree of servility. They respond to any of our requests for help. I believe that we should show our appreciation for their silent and subtle company with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We must also thank two groups of survivors. The first of these is the translators, who survive the reams of pages we throw at them everyday without being exhausted or overcome by such a vast quantity of pages. An average of four thousand pages are produced by the translation service every day. I believe it is only fair to express our gratitude for the rapidity and quality of their work. And, as I cannot mention them all by name, allow me to express our thanks via the Director‐General of Translation and General Services, Mr Wilson.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">And there are more survivors to be thanked: the interpreters. The interpreters manage not to choke on the rapid speeches we cobble together in the few seconds the President may give us if we are lucky. They also work hard to turn our rambling speeches, which are sometimes difficult to understand, into something coherent. Therefore, because they have survived, and because they have helped us so much, we thank them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We should also like to thank those whom we do not see every day but whom we see traces of every day, that is, those who produce the Session News, the document that briefly tells us about the sitting. In the inscrutable jungle created by the number of issues we deal with in the House, they are able to choose the appropriate species and tree on every occasion. I should also like to pass on our thanks to them for their work on selecting the right aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must also thank those who produce the Rainbow every day. I would say that they are like good photographers, who photograph a sunset and improve upon it but make us believe that it is exactly the same. With great subtlety, they often improve upon our speeches. We should also like to thank them.</p>
<p class="contents">And, lastly, allow me to express my thanks to my friends – indulge me and let me call you my friends – who are here with me today and who have been with me on so many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also going to say a few words of special thanks to the Secretary‐General. I personally owe a great deal to the Secretary‐General for his skill and his rigour when it comes to putting forward proposals. This has made my work a great deal easier and I should like to thank him from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would also like to thank my friends who have helped me. Ladies and gentlemen, our political activity does not move at a frenzied pace, but we could compare it to a train, not a high‐speed train but a goods train. Yet trains do not move forward if there are no rails and these rails are what stop us from coming off the tracks. On many occasions, I have felt that these rails were guiding me along the right track and making my work easier.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you all from an emotional and a rational standpoint. From an emotional standpoint, there is a Spanish folk song that could express the way I feel at the moment. I am not going to sing it but I will recite the lyrics. Of course, this is a challenge for the interpreters because it obviously rhymes in Spanish. Let us see if they are capable of making it rhyme in every language: ‘They say goodbyes are not sorrowful, they say goodbyes are not sorrowful, say that to him who has said farewell, say that to him who has said farewell".</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is a hint of sadness today; we are not going to try to hide it. We are saying goodbye to one another and we know that we will go down diverging paths and that there will be separate adventures for those we have met day after day in this House. But I must say that the hint of sadness can be compensated for, firstly, by reflecting on what we have done. We can consider two things and the first of these is the satisfaction of a job well done. Ladies and gentlemen, we can be satisfied with a job well done every day, and even on Fridays, and we can say this without being smug and with the peace of mind and conviction we have when stating something we are absolute sure of.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that makes up for the hint of sadness, ladies and gentlemen, is the fact that we know that this is not the end: this great celebration of democracy celebration will help it continue. As Mr Medina Ortega said, many of you have been lucky enough to have democracy handed to you as if it were completely natural and you value it just as naturally. Some of us have had to fight for this democracy. Therefore, every time there is an election, irrespective of the outcome for us as individuals, it is a celebration. It is a reason to be happy because we are safe in the knowledge that nothing is above the will of the people when it comes to choosing their representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we can take solace in the satisfaction of knowing that we will be well represented in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, my friends, I wish you good health and good luck in your future work.</p>
