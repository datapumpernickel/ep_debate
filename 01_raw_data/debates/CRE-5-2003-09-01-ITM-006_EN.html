<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, it is expected that the Basel Committee will, this autumn, come to a decision on the equity capital of banks in the future. It is certain that we will follow with a very critical eye the USA’s plans for transposing this into law in the future, and that we will, of course, come to our own conclusions at European level. If, though, the decision is taken in the autumn, it is envisaged that we will begin the lawmaking process next year. This report concentrates on small and medium-sized enterprises, as Basel II has the objective of making the international financial markets more stable, an objective shared by all.</p>
<p class="contents">The fallout from Basel II must not, however hit those who had no part in destabilizing the financial markets – in particular the small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union, who, as is constantly reiterated, form the backbone of our economy and are the only means whereby we may be brought out of economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been calls for some considerable time for a study, and this makes it all the more important that it should be produced by the time a proposal for a directive is put forward, so that then the relevant conclusions may be drawn as regards the legislation. I would now like to explain a number of the main points in my report that I see as very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the issue of the legislation. I take a very critical view of the way we are acquiring more and more ‘soft law’, by which I mean legislation in international bodies that enjoy no democratic legitimacy. This is no criticism of the work they do, but of the way in which they do it. If Basel II were the only one, one might be able to overlook this, but we are ending up with more and more bodies like Basel II, for example the one on international accounting standards, in which experts get together and formulate standards that are then put before Parliament and the Commission in the expectation that we will transpose them into law without much in the way of correction. The only way we, as responsible politicians, can respond to this process is in the negative. We have to turn our minds to a more transparent process, one that influences the way these bodies are composed. Although I do not believe it to be necessary that we should, in the plenary or in committee, discuss every point of detail, we must, being responsible politicians, acquire greater influence. In any case, the European elections are coming up next year, and, back home, they will be asking all of us why we took this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to my second comitological point. It is quite clear to me too that Basel II is not a typical Lamfalussy process, as the lawmaking process will find us sharing in decisions on the annexes. The Lamfalussy process will, however, be used, as we will at that stage be determining which annexes will be amended by which procedure. The same applies here too; this is not to make a general criticism of the Lamfalussy process, but there are two points that must first be clarified. One – the strengthening of the law, the right of recall – is a matter for the Convention on the Constitution, and the second is, of course, a critical observation. Does Lamfalussy work in the way its creators thought it would, or is there still room for improvement? So much, for a start, for the fundamental principles!</p>
<p class="contents">So far, much has been achieved; there is the million-euro ceiling, which we demand should be adjusted in line with inflation; we have got internal and external rating – where we will certainly have to see to it that smaller banks do not have to face the hurdles of excessive bureaucracy; the 0.2% granularity criterion must disappear, and we have to consider procyclicality. We are calling for a study to re-examine this point, and in greater detail, before the legislation enters into force. How, in future, will start-up-companies in this area be treated? At European level, we will certainly have urgent need of partial use,<span class="italic"> </span>which Basel II has hitherto rejected. It is these things that we demand of Basel, and if the Basel Committee does what we want it to do, we will be able to adopt the rules without making major changes to them. If, though, it does not do so, we will introduce the necessary flexibility at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Basel does, though, present opportunities, such as rating for small and medium-sized enterprises to give them a clear idea of the state of their operations, although here it will be necessary for the banks to allow themselves enough time to explain rating, to work with small and medium-sized enterprises and to support their further development. We will, of course, also have to do our homework at national level. In my own country, people are always talking about small and medium-sized enterprises having a tradition of weak equity capital. Please bear in mind that the weak equity capital of small and medium-sized enterprises is not one of the traditions that I, as a Bavarian, see as a good thing; on the contrary, it results from a misguided fiscal policy over the last few decades. It is now time for the appropriate corrections to be made back home.</p>
<p class="contents">Basel II is to be transposed in 2006 or 2007. This is a realistic goal if we work at it, but we do not hold to it dogmatically; in other words, we reserve to ourselves the right to carry out the scrutiny on which a decision will depend.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, this is an important subject. I wish to begin by saying that the Commission welcomes this own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Radwan and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Parliament's interest in this issue is most welcome. Together with the intensive consultation process that has taken place on the Commission's draft proposals, this debate will contribute strongly to meeting the challenging timetable to adopt a new framework in the European Union at the same time as the new Basel Accord is implemented globally.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully share the view expressed in the report that the current rules on capital adequacy need to be revised. They have become outdated and no longer reflect the realities of the financial services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the report supports the view that the new framework should apply to a broad range of banks and investment firms. That ensures a uniform standard of supervision and also fair competition. A key objective of the Commission is to ensure that the new framework is suitable not only for large banks but also for less complex banks and for investment firms. We are now very close to achieving that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">For bank lending to SMEs – which has been of particular concern in the rapporteur's own country – the report states correctly that numerous improvements have been obtained. The results of the recent impact study indicate that capital requirements for loans to SMEs are now very fair and that they are likely to be reduced as compared with the rules currently in force. That is another important reason not to continue the current rules. The report calls for even further reductions for SMEs and for reductions in the bank capital requirements for venture capital and equity investments in start-up companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I am duty-bound to tell Parliament that the Commission has very strong concerns about this matter. Venture capital is risk capital. If we use the prudential rules to reduce artificially the capital requirements for risky investments, we will be jeopardising the very interests that we are trying to protect – that is, the safety of consumers' savings and the stability of the financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also identifies the very important question of the potential cyclical effects of the new rules: what if, in an economic downturn, the risk sensitivity of the new rules results in less availability of credit? The key lies in striking the right balance between risk sensitivity – and its benefits – and potentially negative cyclical effects. The Commission thinks that the new rules currently proposed strike a good balance. However, this is an aspect that must continue to be closely monitored. We must be ready to act quickly and modify the rules if developments suggest that the balance is not correctly struck.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by repeating what I said when the Commission published its third consultation paper in July. I believe the new capital framework will be good for financial stability, that it will be good for financial institutions and that it will be good for their customers. I therefore welcome this report – for which, once again, I thank Mr Radwan – as a further step towards ensuring that the new European framework will be the best it possibly can be, and in ensuring that it is introduced on time so as not to disadvantage European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that we are discussing an own-initiative report that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted unanimously – my colleague Mr Rübig will have something to say about what went on in the Committee on Budgets. By this we are clearly showing that we are alongside the people and that we act when necessary, that is to say, when it is time for us to speak up and get things done politically, rather than waiting until draft directives are on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this parliamentary initiative is being taken before the Basel Committee adopts any resolutions and before the presentation of the draft equity capital directive to stabilise the financial markets, and it should have just as much long-term influence on these two events as what we have done to date in the aftermath of Mrs Villiers’ report.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that we have indeed achieved much already for small and medium-sized enterprises such as banks, and much towards greater transparency in the political debate on this chapter, and much to reinforce European self-confidence in the Basel Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, though, the fact that we have not yet reached our objective means that we have no shortage of<span class="italic"> </span>demands to make: first, for the adjustment of the one million retail ceiling in line with the annual inflation rate; secondly for the deletion of the 0.2% granularity criterion; thirdly, for the recognition of physical collateral; fourthly, for acknowledgement of the specific financial situation when enterprises are set up or businesses are taken over. Fifthly, an unwarranted administrative burden, with resultant additional costs, devolving upon banks, must be avoided; our sixth is that the transparency of rating criteria should be guaranteed; our seventh, that rating should assess research activities and expenditure on investment in a positive light, and, finally, we call for the study on the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises to be produced and for it to be incorporated in the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth area demands something of us. There is still work for policymakers, banks and businesses to do as we prepare for Basel II and the directive. A transparent partnership must be created or extended. All three of them need better framework conditions, and so I am also glad that the Austrian tax reform reduces the tax burden when profits are not withdrawn, as this strengthens equity capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ettl (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I congratulate Mr Radwan on his report, which really does get to grips with all the issues raised since the first drafts from Basel, which demand that the special economic and social circumstances in the EU be taken into account. The international bank supervisors and issuing banks in Basel, and the Commission in Brussels, have already met many of the demands made by us in Parliament, but there are still a few major stumbling blocks to be dealt with. In particular, the Commission must take our concerns into account in its deliberations, even though, formally speaking, we are not involved in the process and it is only next year that we will be dealing with the directive to incorporate this agreement into the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequence of this is that we MEPs find the process of working through this rather complicated; of the Commission, it demands a willingness to cooperate, and that to the utmost. We MEPs take the view that there are two principles that must be adhered to. Firstly, we take the view that any banking supervision law must, in the final analysis, serve to protect creditors, by which is meant savers, and ensure the functioning of the financial market, and, secondly, as we in the EU are endeavouring to create an internal market for financial services, transposition should be by means of a directive that leaves room for special rules at the national level only when, in really objective terms, there are special circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The first principle demands that the risks entered into by the banks be defined and assessed in an objective way. Banks calculate equity capital on the basis of the risk of loans being defaulted on, and this, in its turn, of course, has an effect on the interest charged to the borrowers. The Basel II system – for that is what I am talking about – must maintain a balance. It must not lead to extra burdens that banks and borrowers will find unfair, disproportionate and uncontainable, nor must it hamper employment and innovation. I know that is a bit much to ask for, but that is the basic precondition for the whole thing being acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">When the directive for a large and liquid internal market is prepared, account must be taken of the need for special rules at national level not to be allowed to increase unchecked. Consumer protection, too, needs to be harmonised across frontiers if competition is not to be bounded by national borders. One of the distinguishing characteristics of our social structure is the co-existence of enterprises run as private businesses alongside those that perform services of general interest. Private/public partnerships are a case in point, and it is only in such cases that it is appropriate to permit rules at national level on banking supervision law.</p>
<p class="contents">If the same yardsticks are applied to all these borrowers, the system of evaluation will become more expensive, or the banks will be hindered from giving credit. I would like to conclude by again pointing out that credit given in the future must not be allowed to restrict the labour market, and nor must Basel II be allowed to serve as a pretext for the cancelling or restricting credit. We already have uncertain growth, and we must not allow matters to be made even worse by banks passing on debts to Basel II. What business management requires, and what is economically desirable, is simply an objective approach when assessing the risks of individual borrowers, calculating the interest rate for the credit, and when agreeing to give it. It is this principle that reinforces my positive stance in relation to Basel II. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markov (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that precise assessment of risks when giving credit is of crucial importance to the stability of the banking system, and so, whilst supporting the Basel II agreement’s objective of strengthening the banks’ hand in evaluating risks, we nevertheless have a number of critical observations to make.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, the Basel Agreement should primarily be directed at internationally active banks, which could represent a risk to the stability of the financial system worldwide. In many Member States, small local banks play an important role. There is a need to ensure that the costs imposed on these institutions by new supervisory rules remain manageable and do not lead to credit becoming more expensive. This is where the Commission has chosen a more flexible basis than did the Basel Committee, but it remains an unsatisfactory one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, nothing has been done to dispel the fears that this compromise will worsen the situation as regards the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. The million-euro threshold is to be raised in order to prevent the cost of credit granted by small banks becoming too expensive for SMEs. It is quite incomprehensible that no detailed analysis has been presented at European level of how the new equity capital rules will affect the conditions under which SMEs raise finance. It is for that reason that we must support the rapporteur’s demand for such a study of SMEs to be presented before the proposed new directive enters into force and for its findings to be taken into account; failing that, the development motor that SMEs represent in their regions may be throttled.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what appears highly problematic about the new equity capital regime is its effect on macroeconomic stability, as it will very probably result in procyclicality. When the economy is in a downturn, it is normal for there to be greater credit risks, so that the banks can limit their lending, hamper investment activity and consequently accentuate the downturn. This is where I believe changes need to be made to the rules, or else this needs to be examined in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point is one to which the rapporteur has already alluded. The comitology procedure that has been chosen reflects only inadequately Parliament’s concerns, as, at the end of the day, it is not clear which issues are of political principle and which are technical in nature, so that Parliament could, under certain circumstances, be prevented from making amendments at a later stage. We should therefore endorse and support the demand for a formal right of recall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If Basel II were to be implemented as it has been drafted by the Basel Committee, then it would be easier for businesses that do not need money – that is, loans – to have access to credit. Vice versa, businesses that do need loans – that is, money – would find access to them drastically more difficult. In Austria, for example, some 65% of businesses are financed by bank loans. The EU average is only 46%.</p>
<p class="contents">For the most part these businesses have little equity capital. The building, tourism and gastronomy industries are particularly affected. In Austria, for example, the equity capital of the gastronomy industry is only 1.75%. Since, however, it will be equity capital that determines the allocation of loans in the future, then, according to Basel II, these businesses and industries will receive no or very few loans. The consequences would be disastrous. Businesses would no longer be able to invest and modernise and would have to close. We would lose thousands if not many thousands of businesses and jobs. I have to agree with the rapporteur’s call for these repercussions to be analysed to reveal the negative effects of Basel II and to allow counter measures to be introduced at the same time to prevent them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree over the need to move to a risk-sensitive framework which rewards prudent lending and penalises imprudent lending. I also agree with the aspiration to implement the accord in as near parallel with the United States as possible, to prevent the banking sector in the European Union from suffering a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Mr Radwan's report recognises the importance of proper cost benefit analysis and of tailoring the framework to the needs of different sectors affected by the capital adequacy directive. That includes both small and large banks, investment firms and firms which have a mix of investment and credit business. In the future we may have to amend the directive to take into account the needs of commodities firms, if they are brought into the framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commission on its progress in dealing with the issue of small business lending. It is absolutely right that the framework should not penalise small business lending unnecessarily. Many small businesses have nothing to fear from a risk-sensitive framework because there are many small businesses which are very good risks and which therefore can expect to get cheaper finance as a result of Basel II. There are, however, some small start-up businesses which are high-risk and I agree with the Commissioner that they should continue to attract a high capital charge. On the whole, with regard to SMEs – particularly in the light of reforms to the definition of retail which embrace a lot of SME lending – we are working towards a framework which is a fair and balanced solution on the SME lending issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the framework take a light touch on operational risk. Operational risk is something that is not yet easily calibrated and we should be very cautious before we impose a large charge. We should be flexible in reflecting developments on how that charge is measured. It is also vital for the framework to recognise the important risk mitigation role played by collateral, both financial and physical. That is another very important part of the Radwan report which we, as MEPs, should recognise. We should also recognise the importance of insurance and indemnity insurance as a way of mitigating risk. This is particularly important in relation to investment firms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the framework should try to go with the grain of professional practice. It should encourage good practice and work with the best of industry practice, rather than perhaps impose a wholly different framework on top of good industry practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur quite rightly stated in his report that the changes made in past years have all been in the right direction. Our committee has clearly said, as I would also like to do, that Basel II is right to aim to make banks more stable, and that aim of Basel II is a very laudable one in view of what we know about the costs associated with bank crises. The fact is that risk sensitive loan pricing is a key requirement for a stable financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">Basel II still needs to be discussed. The debate has already lasted more than four years and I must say that it is positive that, in particular under the first pillar, the risk weighting function has been lowered and made significantly shallower. This avoids possible problems relating to access to credit, above all for SMEs. Furthermore, it is also positive that the appeal of shorter loan periods has lessened. From a European perspective, it is also certainly important that there should be no discrimination against tangible collateral. It must be dealt with in the same way as financial collateral.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, finally realise, that Basel II will have an impact, not only on small and medium-sized banks, but also on SMEs. The extremely varied funding framework in the EU, which is nonetheless indispensable for business, must be kept. An increase in capital demands for loans secured by the economy’s promotional bodies and self-help institutions that are not covered by risk considerations must be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">A few further questions: I believe that it should be justified why only ten banks in the USA have to use Basel II and a further ten institutions use Basel II on a voluntary basis, whilst in Europe all credit institutions must implement the models. It is quite right that small European banks are not in direct competition with US institutions excluded from the Basel obligations, but instead with these institutions’ corporate customers. This could potentially mean that, in terms of competition, European businesses would be put at a disadvantage on the world market. I think that this needs to be clarified and I also count on the opinion sought by the Commission discussing this point, and in sufficient time for it to give rise to some amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that it is very important that the crucial points that have been brought up by Charles Goodhart’s research group from the London School of Economics should also be clarified, in particular those referring to the procyclicality of Basel II, to which reference has already been made. I would like to formally give my support to Mr Radwan in his reasoning that Parliament should tackle in good time the problems of SMEs and their employees, that we should continue to do so, and that above all we should also ensure that Parliament’s voice continues to carry weight and will be heard at the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Developing a new framework for capital adequacy will maximise the effectiveness of the capital rules in ensuring overall financial stability, maintaining confidence in financial institutions and protecting consumers' and depositors' interests. This would benefit not only the banking industry but the whole EU economy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, structured dialogue between supervisors, regulators and bank and investment firm representatives is crucial for creating a viable capital framework. A central element – that of democratic control – has been lacking. Therefore, Mr Radwan's objective to involve the European Parliament in the capital adequacy debate and to add democratising elements to the decision-making process is most welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of taking into account corporate risks in loan pricing is a sound one. Risks should be treated the same, regardless of the legal nature and level of complicity of the institution in question. Nevertheless, concerns relating to SME lending, highlighted in the report and by many colleagues, are well-based. For example, in Finland only the larger banks and a dozen companies have external ratings. Therefore the exclusive re-use of external ratings is not a viable solution for us in the short term. Instead internal ratings based on some agreed key ratio criteria could be developed in order to avoid unreasonable costs for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am worried about a large number of national options. I fear that there might be divergences in the interpretation and application of the new framework by national supervisors. These national discrepancies could give rise to competitive inequalities in the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention mutual recognition with the US. EU banks and investment firms operating in non-EU countries should not be penalised by the potential burden arising from divergent requirements between their home and host supervisory authorities. This is a question of the utmost importance for us, especially in the US delegation of the European Parliament, where we have debated these financial security rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about credit standing and the collateral needed for it. Therefore, our main interest is in how this affects SMEs. After all, they account for two thirds of employees in Europe and pay 80% of taxes. Therefore, we would also call for preparation for the implementation of Basel II with a stability pact for SMEs. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy commissioned STOA to carry out a study. One of the most important findings was that, according to rating procedures, banks required up to 400% more deposit for venture financing and start-ups.</p>
<p class="contents">This, I believe, should show us that we in the Committee on Budgets should also get involved. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, and jointly with Mr Mulder, the rapporteur, I submitted a proposal for starting a pilot project in this area, which, through the European institutions and the European banks, would support guarantees for SMEs. In particular, guarantees of up to EUR 25 000 should be available for SMEs. We want a package that amounts to tens or hundreds of millions so that we can help small businesses. We also want a training package, especially for finance ministries. Here, as with the Lisbon process, we need to look into what repercussions the tax law will have on various equity capital structures, reserves, funds, depreciation, corporate income tax, provisions on non-profit activities, for example. There is a lot to be checked and I call upon the Commission to look into these issues in their report, which is long overdue, so that the Member States and their ministers can adopt and prepare for Basel II as best as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission agrees that this is very important, and it is also recognised in the report that we are discussing here today. The Commission recognises Parliament's concerns about the use of comitology: it is an old subject that has often been discussed in this House. This concern is also reflected in the draft report presented by Mr Radwan.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the proposed provisions, both Articles and annexes, will be contained in the Commission's proposal and all will have to be agreed according to the codecision procedure. Therefore, Parliament will be fully within its rights in making all the comments it wishes to make. As I have said a number of times in this House, the Commission supports Parliament's desire to have Article 202 of the Treaty amended, as Mrs Randzio-Plath knows very well.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to raise is the matter of SMEs. It was mentioned by a number of Members – Mr Karas, Mr Markov, Mrs Villiers, Mr Ilgenfritz and others. I should like to point out that numerous improvements have been made in order to ensure fair and proportionate capital requirements for bank lending to SMEs. Examples of this are the lowering of the requirements for riskier borrowers; a discount of on average 10% for smaller borrowers and allowing SMEs to be included in the retail portfolio when the loan is for less than EUR 1 million. Mr Karas asked whether that could be indexed according to inflation. I would have absolutely no objection to that, but it is one of the issues that should be developed according to the comitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Impact studies have been carried out and the results indicate that the new rules would result in fair and proportionate capital requirements for exposures for SMEs, so SMEs stand to benefit, and therefore I cannot agree with Mr Ilgenfritz. I would refer him to Mrs Villiers' very pertinent comments which directly opposed his views. I would suggest that these two Members of Parliament have a short debate on the matter, but certainly the Commission agrees with Mrs Villiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the matter of venture capital, which Mr Ettl in particular referred to. The Commission shares the view that venture capital and equity investments in start-up companies are important.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the purpose of prudential legislation, and that is what we are discussing, is to protect the financial system and the interests of depositors and savers. Indeed, Mr Ettl himself drew attention to the need for consumer protection. Therefore we must be sure that we do not treat riskier investments, for example in venture capital firms, on a basis which is too lax, therefore running the risk of damaging consumer protection. As I mentioned earlier, however, I am happy to clarify that the small firm discount – i.e. the reduction of up to 20% for lending to smaller firms – will also apply to equity exposures to venture capital firms.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members have asked for further studies. The Barcelona European Council asked for further studies to be made on the impact of Basel II on the European economy. In the light of this request, a study is being carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The draft report is due at the end of this year, with the final report available at the end of March. Results of the study are due to be delivered to the Commission early in 2004. As I said earlier, we have now carried out impact studies and next year PricewaterhouseCoopers will carry out further studies as a result of demands placed upon the Commission by the Barcelona European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath drew attention to the fact that only a limited number of banks will have to comply with the Basel II rules in the United States. However, according to Roger Ferguson, the 'number two' at the Federal Reserve, the fact that Basel II will apply to the 'ten plus ten' American banks – the ten biggest and the ten next biggest – means that more than 99% of US foreign banking assets will be covered. Therefore, we can accept that there will be fair competition between European and American banks when they meet internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath and others mentioned the matter of procyclicality. As I said earlier in my introductory speech, increased risk-sensitivity is an important fact. It is my view – and I hope that of Parliament – that the report strikes the right balance in this regard. Modifications have been introduced to reduce the procyclic effects of the draft rules, which is a good thing. We also hope that better risk management as a result of the whole Basel II procedure will enable banks to be better prepared to deal with the effects of economic recessions.</p>
<p class="contents">In his introduction Mr Radwan raised an important point concerning soft law. I well understand the concerns of Parliament on this matter. Soft law means that Parliament may be circumvented. I accept the point of view of those who say that soft law must be kept within bounds so that the democratic contents of law cannot be adulterated. I accept that view but find it difficult to accept that the whole soft law concept would apply either to the accounting standards or to Basel II.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Radwan also drew attention to accounting standards. Both areas – the accounting standards and Basel II – are hideously complicated. I think Mr Radwan would agree with that. Therefore it is reasonable that experts in those fields should be called upon to formulate rules, as is happening with the International Accounting Standards Board and the Basel II Committee on which the Commission is an observer.</p>
<p class="contents">When all that has been done, the results will be set out in the form of directives. There will be a directive on Basel II and on international accounting standards. Therefore, Parliament will be within its rights to make any complaint it wishes to and to raise issues. Once again, while accepting Mr Radwan's point of view on soft law in general, to apply it to Basel II or to the accounting standards is not the right thing to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
