<p class="contents">Not only have I myself, together with other Members who had tabled questions preceding Question No 93, not received a personal explanation from any of the Commissioners, but we have also not even received the mandatory response in writing. In my view, this is discrimination and, since there is no such thing as first-rate and second-rate European citizens and all the Members represent the European citizens, this matter should be addressed and discrimination such as the example I have pointed out must not take place again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Milk production in the Commission's proposed revision of the CAP</span></p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">For a country like Galicia, which accounts for a large part of Spanish milk production, possesses an agricultural structure based on small family farms (and therefore ideal for sustainable rural development), and has in recent decades made an extraordinary effort to modernise the milk production sector, the CAP reform should encourage increased milk production, with the goal of covering the needs of the Peninsular market at the very least. While provision should be made for a transition period during which the intervention price is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council believe that an arrangement of this type is compatible with the options provided for in the proposed post-2008 CAP reform? For countries in Galicia’s position, could these arrangements be brought into force before 2008? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 2 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0608_EN.html">H-0608/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Declaration by the EU Presidency concerning the island of Perejil</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 13 July 2002, the EU Presidency issued a declaration in which it voiced its concern over the situation created by Morocco on the island of Perejil, expressed its full solidarity with Spain and urged Morocco to immediately withdraw its forces. The Presidency’s action on behalf of a Member State is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I assume the Presidency is unaware that some Spanish historians claim Spain has no right or title to this island, which was occupied by Spanish troops for defensive purposes until the early 1960s, when these forces were withdrawn as part of the winding-up of the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco following that country’s independence in 1956.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Presidency not believe that the Spanish Government has overstepped the mark in sending a substantial military force to occupy this tiny island, which Morocco considered to be an act of war, and that the best thing for the European Union to do would be to advocate that the International Court of Justice in the Hague should settle the issue of the sovereignty of Perejil? Does it not feel that there is a contradiction in Spain claiming sovereignty over Gibraltar from the United Kingdom when it rejects Morocco’s claims over this island and other possessions in Africa? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the beginning of July, we all followed with great concern the developments surrounding this small island. There was no doubt about the current status of the island, which had been agreed. There was an understanding between Spain and Morocco to the effect that the island should remain uninhabited and without any sign of sovereignty on the part of either side.</p>
<p class="contents">When Morocco infringed this understanding and this status, the Danish Presidency issued a statement expressing its concern about the situation, as well as solidarity with Spain. At the same time, a strongly worded request was made to Morocco to withdraw its forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council was delighted at the fact that the new Spanish Foreign Minister, Mrs Palacio, who had just come to the Council from Parliament, had met her Moroccan opposite number in Rabat immediately after the episode and that they had confirmed the desire to return to the earlier status quo. The Danish Presidency is confident that this and subsequent meetings will help promote the close relations between Spain and Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Council, I should like to emphasise that, traditionally, the EU’s relations with Morocco have been generally sound. Great progress has been made in recent years, and the mutual cooperation has been extended in many areas, from trade to sensitive issues such as immigration – all on the basis of the association agreement that came into force two and a half years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Dramatic decline in the income of cotton producers in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">Owing to particularly favourable weather conditions, cotton production in Greece was abundant in the 2001-2002 season. Due to the implementation of the new arrangements and the unlimited 'penalties' provided for in Regulation 1051/2001/EC<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> cotton producers' incomes have fallen dramatically – by about 30% – compared with the previous season, and thousands of farmers and all the cotton producing areas are in a desperate economic situation. Regulation 1051/2001/EC was published on 1 June 2001, by which time the sowing and germination of cotton was completed; producers therefore had no means of taking corrective action to adapt to and take into account the new exceptionally severe 'fines' which are different from those imposed hitherto, and the other arrangements. In view of this, will the Council which, according to the Commission's answer to Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2001-1698_EN.html">E-1698/01</a><a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is competent to decide, say:</p>

The problem is that this situation does not only affect last year's harvest, it also affects subsequent harvests. This year's cotton is being harvested as we speak. For the second year running, producers are tearing their hair out because the Greek government has arbitrarily set production at 275 kilograms per decare, whereas output is much higher and no-one knows what will become of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In February 2001, this House voted almost unanimously for an increase in cotton production because the European Union has a 70% deficit. Not only has the Greek government made no attempt to push this European Parliament resolution through, so as to protect Greek cotton growers and their produce; it has, as you have heard, been in an untimely hurry to apply the new regulation and has refused to make use of the European Parliament resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I call on you to stand up for us here and I call on the Council representative to take a stand on the Greek cotton farmers' request for an immediate overhaul of this disastrous regulation in order to protect farmers facing ruin and their product, which has the status of a national product in Greece. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In June 1998, the Council reached agreement on a European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports. That code is not binding. Inter alia, Member States are asked, when refusing authorisation, to indicate the country of destination, the merchandise involved and the end user. Only recently, the FN-Herstal arms company, of which the Walloon Region is a shareholder, delivered 5 500 semi-automatics to an unknown end user.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 5 by Mihail Papayannakis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0616_EN.html">H-0616/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: International Criminal Court</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the USA’s refusal on 1 July to ratify the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC), it has signed a bilateral agreement with Romania concerning exemption for Americans from the ICC. Given that Romania is applying for membership of the EU, and in view of the USA’s clear intention to sign bilateral agreements of the same nature with other applicant countries, could the Council say whether it intends, in addition to expressing its displeasure, to take additional measures with regard both to the USA and the various pre-accession countries in order to prevent the institution of the International Criminal Court being undermined from the very outset?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 6 by Carlos Carnero González (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0667_EN.html">H-0667/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Agreement with the United States on immunity vis-à-vis the International Criminal Court</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its decision of 30 September the General Affairs Council established that Member States might conclude agreements with the United States on the immunity, as regards the International Criminal Court, of its diplomatic and military staff working on Community territory, under certain conditions. The questioner considers that this position undermines the CCI at the very moment when it is coming into being and will encourage third countries to do the same or worse. For this reason he rejects the Council’s attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council consider that the decision reflects the opinion of the majority of European citizens? Has it taken into account the views of the non-governmental organisations and legal experts who have backed the creation of the CCI from the outset? Does the Council know which Community Member States are to conclude immunity agreements with the United States and with what limits? Does it not consider that this means that the EU is abandoning its original stance and losing credibility in the eyes of the international community?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 7 by Sarah Ludford (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0681_EN.html">H-0681/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: International Criminal Court</span></p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council of 30 September 2002 decided guidelines on the basis of which Member States can negotiate bilateral agreements with the United States to give American personnel some immunity from the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the fact that the Council believes that the ICC is a 'valuable instrument of the world community to combat impunity for the most serious international crimes',</p>
<p class="contents">How can the Presidency maintain its assertion that bilateral agreements with the US do not undermine the Rome Statute and the integrity of the ICC?</p>
<p class="contents">How do the GAC guidelines of 30 September accord with the legal advice given previously by the Commission and Council?</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the Council not do more to protect the government of Romania from bilateral pressure when approached by the US to conclude a bilateral agreement prior to the setting out of the EU guidelines and, as a candidate country, was Romania not sufficiently integrated into the EU position on the Court?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I should like to answer the three questions together. I would first of all, however, emphasise that the Council’s conclusions concerning the International Criminal Court do not encourage the signing of bilateral agreements on immunity. It is emphasised that account must be taken of existing agreements between the United States and the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, many of the American reservations can be disposed of on the basis of the existing agreements. It will be up to each individual Member State to assess whether its bilateral or multilateral treaty relations with the United States can be considered adequate to make allowances for the American requests.</p>
<p class="contents">If a Member State were to find it necessary to change existing agreements or to enter into a new agreement with the United States, this would be done on the basis of the EU’s guiding principles. If, in their bilateral contacts with the United States, the individual countries keep within this framework that has been set out, the Court will not be undermined. We would also make it quite clear that, if states that are parties to the International Criminal Court were to enter into agreements such as those now proposed by the United States, this would be incompatible with their obligations in relation to the statutes of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the EU’s guiding principles, any solution should include suitable operational provisions that ensure that people who have committed crimes that come within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court do not enjoy immunity. Legal proceedings must therefore be taken against them, and they must, if necessary, be punished. Such provisions should be able to ensure that suitable investigations take place and that, if there is sufficient evidence, the national authorities take legal proceedings against people at the request of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">This guiding principle ensures that people are held accountable if they have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. Moreover, they will be brought to justice irrespective of whether they are Americans or Europeans. The EU and the United States are agreed that individual responsibility shall apply in the case of the most serious crimes affecting the international community. For many years, the United States has, in close cooperation with the EU, adopted a leading role when it comes to setting up international criminal courts with a view to bringing criminal prosecutions for such crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Another guiding principle is to the effect that new agreements should only cover people who are not citizens of a state that is a party to the Court. Moreover, the EU has carefully defined the category of people to whom this might apply. It is stated, however, that certain persons do not come within the Court’s jurisdiction because they have immunity under international law. Apart from such cases, any solution should, however, only cover those who, because they have been sent there by the sending state, are resident in the country that is being requested to hand someone over to the court. This is in accordance with the Rome Statute’s very narrow definition of persons who should be included under immunity agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">If the alternatives are looked at, the EU approach we have just described is the best way of defending the International Criminal Court. Any other solution would have caused cracks to appear in the EU’s strong support for the Criminal Court and would have weakened the Court. A simple rejection of the American proposal would, however, have had very negative consequences for transatlantic relations, and it would have endangered the absolutely vital American commitment to worldwide peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p class="contents">If a common EU position had not been established, it would have caused irreparable damage to the Court. In that connection, I should like to mention that the United States has already entered into bilateral agreements with 12 countries that are unable to take a stand on the EU’s position. If the EU Member States and others were to be encouraged to enter into bilateral negotiations with the United States without strong EU agreement and without clear criteria governing who is to be covered by the resulting bilateral agreements, the outcome would be a multiplicity of bilateral agreements, and that is something which would most certainly undermine the court.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what EU citizens, NGOs and legal experts think, I should like to emphasise that the Council did not discuss this subject in a vacuum and that it certainly did not reach the stated outcome in a vacuum. The Council’s conclusions are based upon extensive consultations between the Member States and upon valuable contributions from the Council’s legal service and from the Commission. The Council has also taken account of the points of view expressed by the NGOs affected. Throughout the whole process, there have been contacts with third countries that are parties to the Court, and the Presidency has also had exploratory talks with the United States. It goes without saying that the Council has also taken full account of the views expressed by the elected representatives in the EU, both in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to which Member States may possibly enter into immunity agreements with the United States, I am not, unfortunately, at the moment in a position to provide information, but I should like to answer questions about Romania’s bilateral agreement with the United States, signed on 1 August 2002. In that connection, I should like, on behalf of the Council, to draw attention to the common position, adopted on 11 June of last year and amended on 20 June of this year. It was a position supported by the candidate countries. The Council remained in close contact with the candidate countries during all of the preparatory work on the position, and the Council intends to maintain these contacts in order to keep the candidate countries fully informed about further developments. The Council has noted that Romania has still not ratified the agreement in question and hopes that it will take account of the position established by the EU after the agreement had been entered into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You said that you did this so as not to rattle trans-Atlantic relations. To be honest, I do not understand that either. Just as I fail to understand that the guilty parties will, you say, be tried before national courts. Not, Mr President-in-Office, by the courts in the United States. No way. The question is: will this apply to other countries at a later date? To the Russians and who knows who else on peacekeeping missions? How can you say that this does not undermine the Court? In all events, when it comes to Romania, which was what I specifically asked about, the question is this: that you hope the agreement signed by Romania will not be ratified is of no interest to me. What does interest me is, do you intend to say to Romania, within the hearing of other candidate countries, that their integration depends on their respecting the European Union's common position on the International Criminal Court? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the legal advice given to the EU institutions was that a contracting party to the Rome Statute that concludes bilateral agreements outside the tight scope of Article 98 acts against the object and purpose of the Statute. Is it not true that the guidelines are really too weak to shut the door to impunity arrangements?</p>
<p class="contents">I heard the minister refer to a common position. I would like to know whether the guidelines legally constitute a common position. Whether they do or not, will the Council at least seek to strengthen these rather vague guidelines of 30 September which allow loopholes contravening the Statute? That would give us a strengthened common position delivering additional safeguards. These should include: oversight of national pledges by the ICC; guarantees that the US will investigate and prosecute its own nationals accused of committing ICC crimes; a requirement on the US to update federal laws to ensure that its courts exercise jurisdiction over all ICC crimes – which is not the case at the moment; agreement to confine the scope to military personnel or closely allied civilian personnel – and not, for instance, mercenaries; inclusion of a sunset clause and the submission of the agreements for scrutiny by the relevant national parliaments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can be stretched in all directions, and I do not think that the President-in-Office is tackling the fundamental issue of whether we have an American strategy that urges other countries to enter into bilateral agreements whereby such countries undertake not to hand over American citizens. This is in line with the fact that the United States has persistently and continually refused to ratify the International Criminal Court Treaty. It strikes me as self-evident that the Council has a credibility problem when, on the one hand, it states that it fully supports the setting up of the International Criminal Court and regards its establishment as a building block of international legal cooperation and, on the other hand, turns a blind eye to, and accepts, America’s blackmailing of third countries. The President-in-Office said that a solution had been found to the blackmailing of Romania. The only practical questions I want to put are the following: what is the gist of this solution, and is it a solution that the Council finds acceptable? If the answer to the latter question is yes, there is still a credibility problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding the first point, I would say in reply that, were the United States to exert the pressure referred to by Mr Krarup, it would be just as well that we have obtained the common position, which is easy to support and through which any such possible pressure can be withstood. In my view, it is one of the great virtues of the common position that it gives very clear support to countries in the event of their being subjected to pressure. I am not aware of this happening, but the honourable Member says that it does.

The request by Tony Bunyan of Statewatch that the documents be made available for scrutiny has been met with partial rejection because the negotiations concerned were secret. The fact is, of course, that, according to the Treaty, Parliament is not entitled to be consulted on these matters, and the question therefore arises as to why it has not been publicly stated that these developments are part of the anti-terrorist measures that are being worked on. My first question is about why the Council is holding its cards so close to its chest when these are matters of very broad general interest that are at stake. My second question is about how far these agreements extend. Looking at Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, it is apparent from Article 24 that, when it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States etc in implementation of these Titles, agreements may be entered into on behalf of the Council without Parliament’s being consulted and without any public debate.

As far as the Council is concerned, it is, however, still prepared to allow Libya to become a fully fledged participant in the Barcelona Process as soon as the country has accepted the Barcelona rules fully and without reservation. Libya has still not given an answer where this issue is concerned. Until it does, it will continue to be invited as an observer to the meetings of the Euro-Mediterranean Committee and to the meetings between the high-ranking officials with responsibility for political and security issues. Libya participated in the ministerial conference in Valencia as the Presidency’s guest.</p>
<p class="contents">There seem at present to be two main trends in Libya. The first prepares the way for a rapprochement with the EU and clearly signals a break with the past, while the second reflects the fact that Libya’s ambitions on the African continent are incompatible with participation in the Barcelona Process. The relative weight of the two Libyan points of view naturally depends upon Colonel Gadaffi's ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU’s view, a strong role in Africa and participation in the Barcelona Process complement each other very well indeed. The Euro-African partnership, whose next summit is planned to take place in the very near future, is testimony to this. The Council also applauds the fact that certain political prisoners in Libya have been released and emphasises that, if Libya asks to do so, it will be able to participate in the Barcelona Process as soon as the outstanding issues have been resolved clearly and satisfactorily. Such participation in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership would also mean that Libya, in common with the other partners, would enter into an association agreement and be covered by the MEDA regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the EU-Ukraine summit in Copenhagen this summer, Ukraine was informed about the Council’s decision in April to highlight the opportunity of strengthening relations between the future enlarged EU and its new neighbours. Both sides emphasised the importance of taking account of the fact that relations between the EU and the countries concerned vary in character and are at different levels of political and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and Ukraine were agreed that the enlargement process creates new opportunities and challenges in various areas. Both sides confirmed that Ukraine could best make use of these opportunities by stepping up its efforts to adjust its legislation, norms and standards to the EU’s. It was also agreed to step up the relevant partnership and cooperation bodies’ discussions of the effects of enlargement on, for example, trade-related issues, visas, the movement of persons and the promotion of regional and cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU recognises Ukraine’s European aspirations. It is important for Ukraine to become better at fulfilling its obligations if these aspirations are to have real content. The EU will continue to support Ukraine in the reform process, including the strengthening of the judicial system, media freedom, human rights and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency feels duty-bound to step up EU-Ukraine cooperation. The working plan for implementing the EU’s common strategy for Ukraine has been presented to the Council, which examined it on 22 July of this year. The Presidency believes that it should be the EU’s overall objective to make the dialogue and cooperation with Ukraine more focused and results-oriented.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities in this working plan are as follows: first of all, the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and public institutions; secondly, support for the economic transition process, including Ukraine’s integration into the European and world economies, and for regional cross-border cooperation with neighbouring countries; thirdly, cooperation on strengthening stability and security within and outside Europe; fourthly, the strengthening of cooperation in the environmental and energy fields and in the context of nuclear safety; fifthly, support for reinforced cooperation in connection with enlargement of the EU; and sixthly and finally, the development of cooperation on legal and internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of an overall EU policy towards the EU’s new neighbours, with full respect for the differences between the countries involved, will help in achieving the overall objectives. On the basis of a common contribution from the High Representative, Mr Solana, and from Commissioner Patten, the Council discussed relations between the enlarged EU and its Eastern neighbours at the meeting on 30 September. The Council reiterated its conviction that EU enlargement will offer a good opportunity to strengthen relations between the EU and its new neighbours with a view to creating stability and narrowing the gap in prosperity at the EU’s new borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my personal belief that it was of great strategic importance when, during the Swedish Presidency, Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson, on his last trip away on foreign policy business, actually visited Kiev and met with the Ukrainian government. I view the line taken by the Danish Presidency as a continuation of that policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask a couple of follow-up questions. Firstly, is it conceivable that, in the relatively near future, Ukraine could be offered a special agreement, which could be an Eastern European variant of a special economic relationship, that is to say, a form of Eastern European EEA Agreement?</p>

At its meeting on 21 October, the Council expressed satisfaction with the agreement concerning the new government in Skopje.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council encouraged this new government to lose no time in putting full implementation of the framework agreement and stabilisation and association process at the top of the agenda and emphasised that it is looking forward to close and fruitful cooperation. The EU will maintain its strong commitment to Macedonia and will actively support a government amenable to reforms. The Council is also looking forward to the planned census being held in accordance with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Agreement has not come into force because it has still not been ratified. Until such time as it is, an interim agreement on trade aspects, which came into force just over a year ago, has been entered into. As part of a multi-annual programme for the years 2002-2004, the European Community has appropriated EUR 130.5 million to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to support the country as it prepares to fulfil the obligations associated with the interim agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the visa requirement for Macedonians was discussed at the most recent meeting of the Macedonia-EU Cooperation Council, held on 1 and 2 July of this year, and, on this occasion, the Commission reminded the authorities in Macedonia that they must make a number of practical arrangements before the EU will be able to consider cancelling the visa requirement. The Member States and the Commission are following carefully the progress in fulfilling these criteria that is being made by the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are seeing that the term Yugoslavia in expressions such as ‘the former Yugoslavia’ and ‘the remains of Yugoslavia’ has actually disappeared and is to be replaced by the term Serbia-Montenegro.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Abduction of Mr Ali Khanbiev, a doctor, in Chechnya</span></p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">At around 3 to 4 a.m. on the morning of 4 September, masked men abducted Ali Khanbiev from his home in the village of Benoi (Chechnya), where he had continued to work as a doctor in the local hospital. Mr Khanbiev, who was born in 1958, is the brother of Umar Khanbiev, Minister of Health in Aslan Maskhadov's government.</p>
<p class="contents">What information does the Council have concerning Mr Khanbiev's abduction? Is the Council aware that it has all the signs of an abduction by Russian military and paramilitary forces and, consequently, there is every reason to fear for Mr Khanbiev's safety? What initiatives has the Council taken, or does it intend to take, to urge the Russian authorities to make every effort to secure Mr Khanbiev's immediate release?</p>

When comments are issued, it is the Presidency that issues them. With regard to the visit in question, I should like to make it clear that, during her visit, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, Mrs Onkelinx, expressed her condemnation of stoning. Moreover, she repeated the European Union’s position on the matter in order to dispel any misunderstanding of what had been said during the discussion in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights issues – and, specifically, the use of cruel forms of execution such as stoning – have always been high on the agenda of the comprehensive political dialogue that takes place at the half-yearly meetings between Iran and the EU. At the most recent meeting in Teheran on 10 September 2002, a number of specific human rights issues were also discussed. Furthermore, the EU makes regular overtures in connection with such matters. We are at the moment aware of three cases in Iran in which people have been sentenced to death by stoning. All three sentences have been appealed against, so the judgments are still not final. There must be no doubt at all that the Council will follow these cases very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, I can inform you that the EU has discussed an initiative aimed at establishing a formal human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the guidelines for dialogues with third countries approved by the Council in December of last year. Not until this month did European and Iranian human rights experts meet for a series of exploratory talks in Teheran.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to add that human rights are one of the four essential areas in which the Council has stated that it wishes to see progress, now that the EU and Iran are in the process of developing close trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 October, that is to say a couple of days ago, the Council emphasised that it considers it very important that a human rights dialogue should offer an opportunity to achieve practical improvements regarding respect for human rights. It decided therefore to embark upon such a dialogue on the basis of the conditions, timetable, subjects, benchmark points – that is to say, objectives – and choice of interlocutors discussed in the course of the EU’s fact-finding mission to Iran. It was also decided that the first meeting within the framework of this dialogue should take place as early as this year in Teheran. Finally, the Council has, on the basis of an initiative by the Presidency, very recently brought up a number of matters in quite a few different countries, including Iran. On the basis of this initiative, the Council adopted, on 30 September, a declaration on the death penalty and, in particular, cruel forms of execution. In its declaration, the Council again emphasises, clearly and unambiguously, that the EU repudiates the death penalty and, in particular, execution by stoning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope, incidentally, that the President-in-Office of the Council is not going to say that he was unaware of what was being said in the press. Such actions clearly demonstrate the position of the Iranian authorities, which is not to budge one inch in their approach to human rights. The number of executions reported in Iran has trebled in the last three years and, given these circumstances, the question is this: is the European Union going to conclude a trade agreement with Iran in the wake of these systematic breaches of human rights or not?

That is deeply tragic, but the Council has devised a strategy for nonetheless being able to embark upon human rights dialogues with countries that impose this penalty. That is, in my view, perfectly in order, moreover. It is of course a dialogue involving, on the one hand, vigorous condemnation and, on the other hand, simultaneous efforts of persuasion to bring about improvements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Promotion of police-state mentality and informer culture in EUROPOL text</span></p>
<p class="contents">A report in the newspaper Rizospastis claims that a EUROPOL document entitled 'European Best Practice for Handling Informers' gives guidance and instructions for the 'recruitment and handling' of informers. These instructions include methods of payment and amount, as well as certain forms of immunity to be granted – informers are not to be arrested 'when they commit offences within prescribed limits' and they are also allowed 'to take part in criminal activities' after 'authorisation from an authority established in accordance with the guidelines'.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council approve of this EUROPOL text, which is flagrantly contrary to respect for human rights and human dignity itself? Will it take immediate measures to call a halt to this slide towards a police state mentality, authoritarianism and spying on the private lives of citizens, their political, trade union and social activities and their collective organisations?</p>

I can nonetheless confirm, however, that there is a Europol document concerning the subject we are now talking about. This document describes best practice for handling informers with a view to helping the police authorities in the Member States. The document is not binding, and it has been prepared on the basis of Article 3(2)(i) of the Europol Convention. It is based partly upon the Executive Committee’s decision of 29 April 1999 on general principles governing the payment of informers and upon the Decision of the Central Group of 22 March 1999<span class="bold"> </span>on general principles governing the payment of informers. These decisions have therefore been integrated into the European Union’s prior regulatory framework, cf. the Protocol integrating the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into the framework of the European Union, and both have been published in the Official Journal of 22 September 2000. Police use of informers, including questions of payment and immunity, naturally depends upon the state of the national law in the Member State concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, I shudder at the thought that we are surrounded by a network of informants and I wonder if the purpose of such clarity was perhaps to remind us of this and warn us that our slightest misdemeanours are under constant surveillance. As Europol appears to be giving informants official status, I wonder whether a scale of pay has been set and whether there will be invitations to tender and then at least some of our young unemployed could apply for the job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
