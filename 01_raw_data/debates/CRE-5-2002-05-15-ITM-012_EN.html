<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today finds us dealing with a report that has been unanimously adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, thus showing that the Members on the Committee took the view that the approach I have proposed in it is the right one. These ladies and gentlemen, though, had the opportunity in January to listen to a number of members of the Albanian parliament address the Committee. They were able to form for themselves a conception of how mature this country and its politicians are. I would rather not repeat what my colleagues said during that debate. Unfortunately, though, I did not get the impression that my colleagues' remarks, and my own, during that debate helped get all the region's politicians at last to realise that they, whether in government or opposition, actually had to engage in politics for the sake of the whole of the Albanian people!</p>
<p class="contents">So I have already come to the conclusion that here we are submitting a report that is somewhat stringent, not stringent out of any lack of affection for the Albanian people, but because we perhaps care more for them than do some politicians in that country, who are less concerned with the well-being of the people than with their own pockets and their own positions. I say this because I know the people there and because I also know their politicians, and so I do think that, rather than beat about the bush, we should actually say out loud that, last year, elections were held. They were rigged. We then allowed them not to be repeated, but then – as the election had been rigged to bring about a sufficient majority in the parliament, which was to elect the president in June – asked for the presidential election, at least, not to be held, but for politicians instead to unite and try to find a figure who could then be a president for all Albanians, rather than an Albanian president who owed his position to a stolen majority. I am therefore very grateful that Members have followed me on points 4 and 5, in which we asked the Albanians, before the Commission resumes negotiations with them, to at least comply with all the requirements of the OSCE/ODIHR election observers' committee, allowing that committee to begin its work in the parliament, checking that new electoral legislation is also set in motion and that the political forces should give some consideration to who, in Albania, can lead that country in such a way as to unite it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there are many who say that the opening of negotiations of course means that everything can be monitored much better. That I do not believe! We go there more than we do anywhere else. Albania is the only country in the world for which there is a friendship association in which states and organisations join together and meet several times a year in order to help the country – and what has been the result? I know that Albania has had a worse fate to endure than any other country in Europe. We know that. Hoxha was no Tito, nor was he a Honecker. Hoxha was Hoxha and he was appalling. But Albania has now for some time been free of Hoxha, and so we could have expected things to get a bit better. There are no end of things to do, though. Albania does not do what it has to do because it has to draw closer to Europe. Albania has to do these things out of the desire to be a proper democracy, because it wants the best for its citizens, and for that it needs decent jurisprudence, administrative practice and people to be enabled to have the property of which they were dispossessed restored to them, for which a proper infrastructure is required. Albania also needs all these things in order to attract investors. It needs the confidence of foreign investors, and for that it needs good policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view that the Council would be well advised to seek advice from us, as it is we who will, at the end of the day, have to approve the Agreement. I believe that the Commission's thinking is basically along the same lines as our own – that we should not make a start until the Albanian politicians have, in some way, demonstrated their willingness to take a step forwards. Then we will at once be ready to seek negotiations with them in which all the things they now have to work on will be sorted out. Let me remind you that we go there several times each year and are trying everything to help Albania, and that what we are saying today is intended simply to help them rather than being directed against the people. That is why I am very grateful that our vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy was unanimous. I would be delighted if our vote tomorrow were to be so as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has got to the heart of the matter with her wonted precision and customary acuity. I have known Albania for many years, having gone there the first time while the revolution was still going on. I love the country and have high regard for many of the people who live there, including many of its politicians, as do any of us who are concerned with Albania, but I neither can nor will accept that the leading political forces – two people at the top in particular, but also others quite unconnected with them – are incapable of putting their quarrels, animosities, and rivalries to one side and putting the country's interests first.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree entirely with the opinion expressed by Mrs Pack in the report, that there must first be a fundamental willingness to do this. I am not so much concerned by details of the reforms that are certainly still needed in the justice system, in media policy, in security policy, and in the fight against corruption. There is much still to be done in these areas, but they will not be done unless the political forces agree on a minimum consensus. It is true that that is difficult, but we are all from countries which, particularly in the aftermath of crises – I am thinking, for example, of the post-World War II period – have managed to build bridges and work together despite civil war, or, indeed, because of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I was the rapporteur on the Agreement with Macedonia. Much of the criticism levelled at that suggests that we voted on it far too early on. I do not know; perhaps we were wrong to campaign for the Agreement in the way we did, or perhaps we were right. With Macedonia, though, there was a quite specific issue, that of the relationship between the ethnic groups. There was even the willingness to make changes in that area – too little, too late, as so often in life, especially in politics. But in the case before us now there is not just one issue – it is the fundamental issue. That is why I share Mrs Pack's view. Unless the principal political forces in this country demonstrate the willingness to join together and put the country's destiny first, I am against us opening negotiations on an Agreement.</p>

Having weathered battles which did not exclude violence between parties, regions and clans, Albania now appears to be realising that it cannot continue to be separate from Europe and that, to enter Europe, it will have to observe its founding principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The methods used to decide the elections held a year ago were still the inferior, traditional methods employed in the past by the Balkan States; in just a few weeks’ time, the next elections for the President of the Republic are due to take place and the impression generated by the discussions which have taken place in this very Chamber in the European Parliament is that the Albanians might now be realising that, if they are to make any progress towards normalisation, they will need a high-calibre candidate for the presidency who has the backing of a large popular consensus. It is no accident that, among the problems the successful candidate will have to resolve will be widespread corruption, a highly inadequate State administration and organised crime. The judiciary needs to be re-established and frameworks created for the new administration, all without the necessary financial resources. Europe can help Albania by launching negotiations leading to the signing of an association and stabilisation agreement even before the year is out, if possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, conceal that fact that, essentially, it will be up to the Albanians to help themselves and that no negotiations will last long if respect for the Rule of Law is lacking. Their first test will therefore be these presidential elections. The newly formed two-party committee will have to start work the minute the elections are over and will be called upon to investigate precisely the irregularities of the summer 2001 legislative elections. Clearly, the committee will have to ensure that the abuses of power which have given both Albania’s citizens and external observers cause for concern are not repeated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be said that the views expressed in it are, to a very large extent, shared by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The serious financial crisis in 1997 brought Albania to the verge of total collapse as a state. However, in overcoming this crisis, Albania embarked on a period of relative stability. This allowed Albania to start to implement reforms and to address a number of crucial problems. Since 1998, we have seen the adoption of a relatively modern constitution and legislative framework, an overall improvement in macro-economic stability and fiscal sustainability, the effective implementation of the privatisation process, a considerable strengthening of the customs and tax administrations and real improvements in terms of security and public order. Albania has also been positively contributing to the fragile stability of the region. Its position regarding the recent conflict in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for example, has been pretty helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">This progress allowed the Commission, in June 2001, to recommend, <span class="italic">on balance</span>, the opening of Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with Albania, on condition, however, that it continued a consistent reform effort, including reinforcing democratic standards and administrative capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Things have, alas, not gone nearly as well as we would have liked since June last year. Although the 2001 parliamentary elections marked progress over previous elections, a number of isolated but serious irregularities were identified by international observers. As a result of these irregularities, the opposition decided to boycott the parliament. For several months, this decision impeded the proper functioning of Albania’s democratic institutions. The internal conflicts within the ruling Socialist Party – very present since last autumn in the Albanian political arena – ultimately led to the fall of the Meta government in February. These developments have not enhanced Albania’s case for early negotiation of an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">For several months, the attention of Albanian politicians has been diverted from the essential task ahead: that of addressing, rapidly and efficiently, the many shortcomings identified in the June 2001 report by the Commission. The reform process has slowed, there has been a loss of momentum and Albania is not in the position to afford this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Majko government needs now to refocus very rapidly on the needed reforms and accelerate their implementation; to regain momentum and to guarantee a long-term commitment to reform. This is the only way for Albania to ensure that it will be in a position to implement a future Stabilisation and Association Agreement in full.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before the House usefully underlines the points which the Commission has been making to the Albanians. As a result of our shared messages, we have recently seen some attempts by the Albanian authorities to reinvigorate the reform process: important laws and bylaws are being passed. Initial steps for the implementation of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights recommendations have been carried out, the political environment appears to be becoming a little less confrontational. But these steps need to be consolidated. Albania must demonstrate unequivocally that it is committed to the path of reform. This will be a crucial consideration for Member States in deciding when, and at what pace, to conduct Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Albania needs to ensure long-term political stability as a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> to tackle the difficult challenges ahead. In this context, the forthcoming presidential elections are a key test. The Commission shares the report’s recommendation that a new president elected in a climate of consensus would be, by far, the best way to preserve – and further strengthen – stability. As I have just mentioned, the Commission views political stability as a pre-condition for meaningful reform. This is why we believe that the manner in which these elections will be conducted and the potential impact of their results on Albania's political stability should be factors to be taken into account when deciding to open negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s views coincide with the Pack report as regards the issues considered as important for the implementation of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. These include: reinforcement of the implementation capacity of the Albanian administration; Albania’s judicial system should be substantially improved and freed from corruption and political interference; organised crime and all types of trafficking should be vigorously combated; energy sector reform should be rigorously implemented in order to prevent more serious consequences for the Albanian economy and so on. I am sure the House will have noticed that the recent Commission report on the stabilisation and asociation process makes very similar points.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one final point on the draft negotiating directives which, as the House knows, are being finalised in the Council. Firstly, I fully share the view expressed in the report that the negotiating directives to be given to the Commission must enable us to ensure that Albania will be in the position to implement all commitments it may undertake during negotiations. I can assure the House that the Commission wants to carry out serious negotiations, and does not intend to finalise them until it is satisfied that Albania can effectively implement its obligations under a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Moreover, I can also confirm that the draft negotiating directives address the various subjects indicated under Paragraph 10 of the report’s resolution – such as human and minority rights, the Rule of Law and so on – and that proper attention will be paid to these topics during negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point: these negotiations, these agreements, are not a political fix, they are not a political gesture. They are contractual agreements of very considerable importance and we cannot allow them to be determined by political lobbying. They have to be decided by real action, real reform and real commitment on the ground.</p>
