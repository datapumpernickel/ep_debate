President Osmani, thank you for accepting our invitation to address the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Dear President, we know full well of Kosovo’s commitment to a European path and I know your commitment to ensure the necessary conditions to advance down this path continue to be implemented in earnest. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me say at the outset that we are grateful for your support in providing shelter to Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s illegal invasion and your support in aligning with us on sanctions. We must keep standing with Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">This House stood with you when it seemed impossible, and I think we can all recognise just how far Kosovo has come. The journey towards visa-free travel has been an arduous one. But together we can be proud now, that by 1 January next year, Kosovo citizens will be granted this freedom too.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law are all fundamental values that this House of Parliament stands by, vociferously. We are well aware of the challenges and consequences that recent events in your country can have on stability in the region, and the continuous need for the European Union to keep underlining the benefits of de-escalation and cooperation over confrontation. </p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo’s journey continues and this House welcomes your country’s endeavour to tackle challenges head on, by the need for resolute and immediate steps to calm tensions, to cooperate with international partners, with our Member States, and investing in cross-border projects and partnerships. </p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament wants to hear from the people of Kosovo on how best to create economic prosperity, opportunity, long—term stability and progress in your region. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us continue our constructive dialogue, to ensure tangible results for us all.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vjosa Osmani,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Republic of Kosovo</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Madam President, <span class="italic">liri, pavarësi, demokraci</span>; freedom, independence, democracy; <span class="italic">liberté, indépendance, démocratie</span>. Dear President Metsola, honourable Members of the European Parliament, those three powerful words were not just words passionately and repeatedly uttered by Kosovo’s founding father, Dr Ibrahim Rugova. They were indeed the vision of the people of Kosovo. Today, that vision of Rugova, of our heroes and of our people is a reality. Kosovo today is free. Kosovo today is independent. And Kosovo today is a beacon of democracy. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was 25 years ago that here in Strasbourg, our visionary leader, President Rugova, was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament. That day, he was introduced by the then President of Parliament as ‘a man who is the voice of his people, a people who can rarely make themselves heard’. President Rugova viewed the prize as a recognition of the sacrifice of the people of Kosovo and their struggle for freedom. But crucially, he used this very platform to ask for the support of the Members of Parliament to come together on the name of the very values that this union stood for. He asked for Europe to come together in defence of an oppressed people. </p>
<p class="contents">In the midst of war, as tanks were rolling into my hometown, Mitrovica – I was just 15 years old at that time –I remember how that moment, that speech gave us so much hope. We were finally being heard. Europe had not just opened its doors for President Rugova, but it had opened its hearts and minds for a systematically oppressed people. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, also standing here in Strasbourg, I am honoured to be the very first President of the independent Republic of Kosovo to speak before the European Parliament and, most importantly, to say thank you. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the immeasurable support and for your continued contribution that this institution has made for our freedom, our democracy and our independence. As President Rugova closed his remarks, he spoke of the old Albanian proverb, saying ‘A house cannot be kept without friends’. This was true for us during the 1990s, but it is equally so today as we look to strengthen our alliances and one day join you here in this family of nations. </p>
<p class="contents">Today I am here to extend the deepest gratitude of the people of Kosovo for your unwavering support and, at this critical juncture, to urge you to remain steadfast by our side – not just because we are part of the family of nations that make up our continent, but because the values this institution represents are a fundamental part of our history. European values are woven deep within the tapestry of our society. </p>
<p class="contents">We, the people of Kosovo, have walked side by side with European institutions, bound by a rich heritage. We continue to walk side by side as we fight to protect our shared values, and we will remain side by side as we guide our continent towards the full attainment of a Europe whole, free and at peace.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today, I stand before you not only as the President of a resolute European nation and an EU-bound country, but also as the leader of the youngest Europeans. Our country is bursting with energy, immense talent and fervent European enthusiasm. Kosovo is Europe, and to be Kosovar is to be European.</p>
<p class="contents">Our young Republic was born to the beat and sound of Europe. When Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008, in the absence of our national anthem, it was the European anthem that echoed in our institutions, in our squares and in the streets of my country. Just like the fearless spirit of a new-born Republic, the <span class="italic">Ode to Joy</span> resonated with the feelings we carried in our hearts and souls, admiring and embracing the ideals of freedom, peace and solidarity. Determined to join the European family of nations – and inspired by the European Union – we found solace and unity in the universal language of music. </p>
<p class="contents">But this act went beyond symbolism: it was our declaration to the world that the European Union was our rightful destination and a plea for European institutions to embrace these unwavering aspirations. </p>
<p class="contents">At 15 years old, the Republic of Kosovo remains the most pro-EU country in the region and beyond. More than 95% of our people express their uncompromised yearning to join these institutions, encapsulating our historic strategic orientation. Enshrined in our Constitution, Euro-Atlantic integration remains our one and only destination. Euro-Atlantic integration is not just an ambition for us; I am confident it will soon be our future. </p>
<p class="contents">In our DNA. European values and the EU spirit are deeply ingrained. It is these values that shaped our past, inspire us in the present and guide us towards a future where Kosovo flourishes as a beacon of European ideals. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the Republic of Kosovo stands as a testament to the resilience, determination and unwavering spirit of its people, to the strength of our liberation struggle, but also – and importantly – the support of our allies, the support of partners like this great institution. The very existence of our country demonstrates what democracies can achieve when they stand together, when they stand by the oppressed, when you all stand by those who fight for justice and equality.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And when we all stand together against tyranny, dictatorship and genocide. When we stand together as Europeans, freedom flourishes, democracies strengthen, equality is instilled, prosperity grows and unbreakable alliances are formed. I am confident that this same Euro-Atlantic unity and resolve will continue to support Ukraine all the way through to victory.</p>
<p class="contents">In times of great uncertainty and turmoil in Europe, the actions we take now, together, will determine our future in so many fundamental ways. Perhaps even more important than the challenge itself is the way we’re going to respond to it. </p>
<p class="contents">But ladies and gentlemen, moral challenges like the one we face on European soil today with Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, shouldn’t need long philosophical or political debates, because the answer should be immediately clear. There’s no halfway house to democracy and freedom. There should be no grey zone as to where we stand against autocracies and against tyrannies. European unity thus far has been unprecedented and perhaps historic, but we must go one step further to secure Ukraine’s victory and its just peace. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This moment, right now, for Europe and the world requires leaders to come together to envision a brighter world and to take even bolder decisions. This will not be easy. It will require courage, vision and, most importantly, even greater cooperation among us. No matter how big or small, we should be united by the values we believe in. Every country, every one of you, every one of us can and must play a part. </p>
<p class="contents">The words ‘never again’ were not just a slogan for the people of Kosovo. These words, in fact, shouldn’t be a slogan for anyone. But just two decades on, we see utter devastation on European soil once again as Putin wages his illegal and indiscriminate war against Ukraine. </p>
<p class="contents">The people of Kosovo don’t have to imagine the pain and suffering of Ukraine. We have already lived through it. We don’t have to imagine their loss because to this day our hearts ache for the friends and family members we lost during the war, many of whom are still missing because of enforced disappearance. We don’t have to imagine their sorrow and frustration in the face of grave injustices. We feel it, too. So when we, the people of Kosovo, say ‘we stand with Ukraine’, we don’t just say it – we feel it with every fibre of our being. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">24 February 2022 was a dark day for Europe and an unimaginable, painful day for the people of Ukraine. For us, it was a memory relived, one we hoped to never witness again. In our darkest days, you stood by us. Today, as we stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, we are jointly fortifying the very foundations of Europe. It is a testament to our unyielding unity, our unbreakable solidarity and our unequivocal commitment to peace and democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">We owe it to Ukraine and we owe it to Europe. This is our time to exemplify the unity, solidarity and support that you so graciously bestowed upon my people in our hour of need. Kosovo may be a small country but we are willing to do whatever it takes to support our Ukrainian friends. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We were the very first country in our region to impose sanctions against Russia and have continuously been seeking effective and impactful ways in which we can help. From training Ukrainians in demining – so that we can ensure as many lives are saved from the horrendous traces of war that Russia is leaving behind – to working to support survivors of sexual violence, as well as a dedicated programme to support Ukrainian journalists to continue to report the truth: we stand ready to do more. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Members of the European Parliament, dear friends, throughout our history we have faced countless challenges and overcome insurmountable odds to stand proudly as an independent country. Indeed, our very journey to freedom and independence and our struggle for self-determination resonate with the very foundation upon which the European Union was built – a Union founded on the principles of peace, democracy, human rights and recognising each other’s sovereignty, but also on the important principles of transitional justice and dealing with the past. </p>
<p class="contents">Since declaring independence in 2008, the people and institutions of Kosovo have embarked on a remarkable journey of transformation, growth and increasing prosperity. We have worked tirelessly to strengthen our institutions, foster economic growth and consolidate our democracy. Our young and dynamic population, coupled with a well-educated workforce, doesn’t just serve to make it one of the most vibrant places in Europe. It also forms a solid foundation for sustainable growth and prosperity. </p>
<p class="contents">The rule of law stands as the bedrock of any functioning democracy, including as the bedrock of my country. And our commitment to justice is unwavering. We remain steadfast in our commitment to combat crime and corruption, and enhance transparency. And we are absolutely determined in our efforts to ensure that justice is served and that all individuals, regardless of their position or influence, are held accountable for their actions. </p>
<p class="contents">As people that have experienced first-hand atrocities and gross violations of basic human rights, we have emerged stronger, more resilient and deeply committed to the cause of justice and equality. Today, we don’t just speak about human rights – we act upon them. We stand as unwavering champions determined to safeguard and promote these rights for every citizen of our young Republic, no matter their ethnicity, religion or other background. </p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit of inclusivity, I call on all Serbs living in Kosovo to utilise their advanced rights afforded to them in Kosovo’s Constitution. The Republic of Kosovo is your home, and we will do everything in our power to make sure that you feel included, equal and heard. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Building an ever more diverse society remains our everyday commitment. These efforts stand at the very foundation of our Constitution, which is one of the most progressive constitutions on European soil. </p>
<p class="contents">But our efforts in this regard would go in vain if they were not also centred on advancing gender equality and promoting women’s empowerment in all walks of life. It is my lifetime conviction – and even more since I entered this office – to create equal opportunities for girls and women, and to cultivate a more equal and better place for all. Unstoppable in their fight to pursue justice, determined to create a better future for all, firm in their engagement to bring our societies to new heights and committed to breaking historically stubborn glass ceilings: the girls and women of Kosovo are a strong reminder and a daily motivation to never stop fighting for what is right. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And as we navigate these turbulent times and modern chapters of history, characterised by great uncertainties, we have to be reminded of the determinant role of women in processes of peace and security. We must be reminded that sustainable peace requires inclusivity, and that peace and security thrive on the foundations of inclusive democracies. </p>
<p class="contents">Dear Members of this esteemed institution, you will all know the story of Kosovo. Some of you will have visited, some of you will have studied it and some of you will have even played your own part in our journey of freedom and independence. But the true story of Kosovo, as I always say, is the story of its people. A country and a democracy is not stronger because of any one individual or leader or any single reform. A country’s strength comes from the collective strength of its people. The individual stories of almost 2 million people make Kosovo the success it is today. </p>
<p class="contents">With me today, I have a delegation that is a true representation of our beloved Republic. It represents our tough and challenging history, as well as the spirit of resilience, persistence and determination. That is a promise for a great future. Today with me is Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman. She was only 16 years old, 16 years old, when Milošević’s forces ripped her away from the arms of her mother in her very own house to take her to a place that would mark the darkest hour and day of her lifetime. That day, for hours, she was held at gunpoint and raped. And then raped over and over again. </p>
<p class="contents">But it was Vasfije who recognised that it is in silence that wounds deepen. So she decided to speak up. She spoke for justice, against stigma, and managed to rally an entire people behind her. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">She didn’t just dedicate her life to justice. Today, she is the voice of thousands of survivors of wartime sexual violence during the war in Kosovo. She is a real-life hero, you would say, and I couldn’t agree more. But then I want to tell you that we are surrounded by countless everyday heroes in my country, including Fahrije Hoti, who is also joining me today in the delegation. She comes from the village of Krusha, where almost all the men were killed during the war, including many who remain forcibly disappeared. Among them, to this day, is Fahrije’s husband. </p>
<p class="contents">Left alone, helpless and searching for her beloved husband, Fahrije could have chosen to give up, but she chose to fight. She turned grief into motivation. She turned pain into determination. Today, Fahrije Hoti owns Kooperativa Krusha, a powerhouse that kick-started economic development and women’s empowerment through their active engagement in the labour force in a village in Kosovo. But, most importantly, Kooperativa Krusha turned into a place of hope – now exporting its famous pepper spread and other products all around Europe, which I of course invite you to try. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Her actions didn’t just save the lives of hundreds of women in her village, but her story also inspired the début feature of our brilliant film director Blerta Basholli, the film <span class="italic">Hive</span>. Blerta, who is also with me today, became an all-time favourite artist in 2021 at the Sundance Festival. The movie that depicts masterfully the life of Fahrije and the women of Krusha became the first film to win all three main awards in one of the most renowned world cinematic competitions. She has perfectly captured how the darkest parts of history can be turned into an eternal source of resilience, strength and hope for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">And as I speak of a better future, I can’t help but think of Hana Qerimi, who is also accompanying me on this visit. She is the co-founder of Digital School and StarLabs, which started as two small companies in our capital, Pristina, initially with just two people – her and her husband. Today, their start-ups have grown into global brand names with 500 locations around the world. Like so many other businesses in this sector, they are making Kosovo a leader in the region as a tech hub. </p>
<p class="contents">As the company’s success started to cross borders and oceans, Hana has had to overcome near-impossible challenges along the way. Due to onerous and bureaucratic processes, she would often miss the taste of her success and landing her next big opportunity, as her EU-issued visas would expire before she could even travel, and she’d have to apply and reapply multiple times per year. </p>
<p class="contents">For years it was you, this Parliament, that has been fighting together with the people of Kosovo for the cause of visa liberalisation. I want to thank each and every one of you for your vocal support and for the most recent vote that gave Hana and other brilliant and ambitious young people in my country the chance to thrive, just like their peers in the Union. I am sure, like all of us, you will be glad to never hear the words ‘visa liberalisation’ and ‘Kosovo’ in the same sentence again. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the stories of these people are the embodiment of what we call resilience. They embraced the past and turned it into a driving force to help our country and our society thrive. But in doing so, they always remember the importance of giving back. That is our humble way of saying ‘thank you’ to our allies and friends who stood by us in the darkest times and supported us all the way as we are building back. </p>
<p class="contents">Egzon Syla – who is joining me today as well – is from the search and rescue contingent of the Kosovo security force. He knows best what it means to give back. Egzon has led our team in the rescue efforts during the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Turkey. Today, a 2-year-old baby, her mother and many others are alive because of Egzon and his team. Their dedication and professionalism show the true spirit of the people of Kosovo – one that never gives up and always gives back. </p>
<p class="contents">As I speak of the importance of giving back, I look at Liudmyla. Liudmyla Makei was the first Ukrainian journalist to be hosted in Kosovo as part of the Journalists-in-Residence Kosovo Programme launched by our institutions and civil society in support of their cause to defend the truth. When she first arrived, Liudmyla said she chose Kosovo as a destination because she wanted to see life in a post-war country with her own eyes. She realised that the people of Kosovo would understand her best because of our shared experiences. But my people also know the unmatched feeling of freedom, liberty and peace. And I hope the people of Ukraine will soon experience these feelings as they prevail over Russia’s war of aggression.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When you have known utter devastation, victory is precious, peace is invaluable, life is dear and opportunities are seized to their fullest. That perhaps goes some way in explaining why, as two-time summer Olympic partakers, our judokas Majlinda, Distria and Nora have given us the immense privilege of being a country with three gold medals. Or perhaps why Dua Lipa and Rita Ora are not just household names in Kosovo but also around the world, topping global music charts. Or why incredibly talented Kosovar football players – both men and women – shine as outstanding players for many of the clubs and national teams of your countries. And why our young mathematicians and other brilliant young scientists continue to make us proud with their successes worldwide. </p>
<p class="contents">Every time our people are given an equal opportunity, they don’t just exceed expectations – they make history and set world records. Remember this, dear friends: we are not just a country of believers; we are a country of achievers.</p>
<p class="contents">And to all members of my delegation, I want to say thank you. Thank you for who you are and for making Kosovo a better place to this day – a better place for its people, a better place for our friends, a better ally and partner for all. It is because of these incredible individuals and many more in my country that I am so confident that in the near future we will be part of these institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">And as I was coming in, I was also reminded that here with us today is a delegation from the Preševo Valley. To them, I want to say this: ‘We will stand with you’. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">‘You are not alone while facing gross violations of human rights’, as recognised by this respectable institution in its latest resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Dear Members of Parliament, despite the lack of justice and immense suffering over the years, the Republic of Kosovo and its people continue to look to the future – a European future. We have extended our hand of cooperation to all our neighbours and we have done so, in large part, because our people deserve a brighter future, which also means more robust cooperation with our region. </p>
<p class="contents">And as long as it is down to us, I can confidently say that the people and the institutions of Kosovo simply want peace and stability: sustainable peace with justice as a foundation; stability with respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and good neighbourly relations at its heart. </p>
<p class="contents">But, of course, in this process we need strong European leadership that we so often witness in this Parliament and across every institution. This will require a proactive, credible and straightforward roadmap for our region’s future as part of the European family. Our advancement for membership in the European Union would serve as a catalyst for peace and reconciliation in a region where malign forces have historically and continue to sow divisions.</p>
<p class="contents">And even as nowadays my country faces ongoing security challenges because of these malign forces, I am certain that the only way to overcome them is through partnerships and alliances. The very existence of the EU and the values that it represents are irreplaceable. But these values in our region – without a clear perspective of membership – risk being diminished. The lack of integration of democratic countries of the Western Balkans into the EU poses a major security threat to the entire European continent as it leaves the region vulnerable to malign actors and threats. </p>
<p class="contents">The integration of our region is not just of paramount importance; it is also of strategic significance. I am sure you will all agree that the membership of Slovenia and Croatia in the EU has only strengthened the EU position. It did not weaken it. The membership of Albania, North Macedonia and Montenegro in NATO only strengthened regional peace and stability. It did not weaken it. </p>
<p class="contents">I know that, for many of you, I am already preaching to the converted. But as the truly democratic body of these institutions, as the guardians of the will of Europeans across the Union, I know you continue to have a vital role to play in pushing for our integration. </p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo is not some faraway country; it is an integral part of Europe. The Western Balkans is not simply a neighbourhood; it is a natural part of Europe and a strategic interest for the lasting peace and stability of this continent. That is why last year we applied for EU membership, and we hope that the EU institutions and Member States will support our application. </p>
<p class="contents">We count on the leadership and determination that this Parliament so often shows and, in return, I want to reassure each and every one of you that our patience will not wane. We will never stray from our Euro-Atlantic path. We have never looked the other way, and we will never do so. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we are not just with Europe in words, but also in action, with 100% alignment on all foreign and security decisions of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for Kosovo to make meaningful steps towards the European path. Our journey has been marked by sacrifice, determination and an unwavering belief in the values that bind our nations together. It is time for bold decisions and not half steps in terms of integration. </p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo and the democratic countries of the Western Balkans deserve better. We are here by your side and we are part of this family because the Europe whole, free and at peace is only possible when we are all here in this Parliament as equals, collectively promoting, defending and protecting Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">We recognise the challenges that lie ahead on our path towards EU membership. But Kosovo has never – and will never – ask for shortcuts. We believe in a merit-based process for countries that truly respect and act upon what the EU stands for. Because we cannot have European unity without European values. We cannot have peace, stability and prosperity without Member States that are willing to promote these values within their own countries and collectively defend them when they are under attack. </p>
<p class="contents">We are ready to join hands with you to contribute to a stronger, more prosperous and united Europe. Let us have the opportunity to showcase what we have achieved. Let us have the opportunity to enrich the lives of our citizens as we make reforms on our EU path. Let us give back to this family of nations that has given us so much. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us all seize this historic opportunity together and, in doing so, reaffirm the European Union’s commitment to justice, equality and solidarity. Kosovo’s rightful place within the European Union family will not only enrich our nation, but it will also strengthen the very foundations upon which the EU was built and strengthen our continent through even greater unity. </p>
<p class="contents">Dear President Metsola, dear Members of Parliament, dear friends of Kosovo, I started my speech today with President Rugova and I want to conclude with another winner of the Sakharov Prize from Kosovo, Adem Demaci, who spent almost three decades of his life in prison because of his fight for a free Kosovo, where human rights are respected for all. When speaking upon receiving the prize in 1991, he said: ‘By honouring me, you are honouring the people of Kosovo, a peace-loving people, a freedom-loving people, who are undergoing great suffering’. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, Madam President, esteemed Members of Parliament, I want to thank you for giving me the honour to be the voice of the people of Kosovo before this valued institution. I hope this plenary has served as a meeting of minds, as a reunion of friends and a testament to what we strive to become. As we aim for a better and a brighter future for all, we must never forget where we have come from. We must always be reminded of how we got here and who stood by us in times of joy and in times of sorrow. </p>
<p class="contents">I chose to also speak of our past because it has shaped our present, and it remains vital as we frame our future. I chose to speak about the EU values because it is these values that serve as our moral compass and guide us and our people to the highest peaks of human achievement. </p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken today about how much we share with the EU – each and every one of us – how much both Kosovo and Ukraine share with each and every one of you. Because our two countries, Kosovo and Ukraine, no matter the distance, share a history of sorrow on common European soil, yet a future of great potential and opportunity in the common European family. </p>
<p class="contents">Nothing illustrates this more powerfully than the shared colours of our flags: blue and yellow, two colours that tell a story. The blue sky and the yellow sun: together these colours represent hope for a new dawn. For Ukraine and for Kosovo, that new dawn is a just peace and membership in the European Union. For Europe, it is strength in new alliances and unity. Blue and yellow: the colours of Kosovo, the colours of Ukraine, the colours of Europe and the colours of freedom.</p>
