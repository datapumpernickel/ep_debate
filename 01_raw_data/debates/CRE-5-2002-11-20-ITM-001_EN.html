Today's sitting winds up two very special days here in Strasbourg. Yesterday we discussed enlargement and I confess the occasion was moving and gratifying. Today, in the presence of the full Commission I am here to present our legislative and work programme for the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">This year the programme bears witness to a new method. In line with our agreement of last January, the main EU institutions have set up a structured political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few months, all Members of the Commission have been available to discuss the Commission's priorities in their areas of responsibility before the relevant parliamentary committees.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise that the Commission sets much store by Parliament’s valuable contribution to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the first year of application, there is of course room for improvement. This year's experience will help us improve in the future. But the results so far are very encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention the major innovations of the working method the Commission followed this year.</p>
<p class="contents">First, this Work Programme must be seen as a big step towards a more highly integrated and coherent planning process for the EU as a whole. So it is also intended as an important contribution to the Council’s first annual operating programme as decided at the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time the programme sets out not only our new proposals but also the main proposals already adopted by the Commission and still to be considered by the Council. This will allow Parliament to take part too in planning this vital aspect of legislative work. The Commission hopes that the three main institutions can reach an agreement on the interinstitutional dimension of this planning process by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our new working method is not based solely on interinstitutional dialogue but also on a constant exchange of information during the operational phase and on more transparency for the public.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003 the Commission will send Parliament and the Council regular monthly updates of its operational planning. This will take the form of a three-monthly rolling programme giving ample information on proposals adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The public will be able to follow all stages of the dialogue step by step since the documents forwarded will be accessible via our web pages.</p>
<p class="contents">President,</p>
<p class="contents">Better coordination between the institutions, enhanced planning of legislative work and more information for the public are tangible proof of our determination to make the EU institutions more efficient and to give them a sounder democratic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows we are putting into practice the guidelines set out in last year's White Paper on European Governance. These are not just technical innovations, but a vital step forward in the development of our integration project.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members,</p>
<p class="contents">As I said yesterday, our main challenge for the coming year will be enlargement once more. So it is naturally our top priority for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities identified by the Commission are:</p>
<p class="contents">· an enlarged EU,</p>
<p class="contents">· stability and security, and</p>
<p class="contents">· a sustainable and inclusive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">These priorities have already been endorsed by the Council and this Assembly. I will now look at how the Commission intends implementing them next year.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>
<p class="contents">We spoke extensively of enlargement yesterday. Today I simply want to stress the Commission's commitment to ensure that all parties involved in the process are capable of meeting their responsibilities from day one of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate countries must have carried over into national law and be actually implementing the body of Community legislation. This process has been going on for years now and it has produced excellent results, but the final phase needs to be monitored with special care.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, I must stress how urgent it is to overhaul the EU's architecture so it can meet the challenges of 2004. There is a qualitative dimension to enlargement that must not be underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">I rely on the wisdom of the Convention that is still in progress and on the Intergovernmental Conference that will be turning its recommendations into a genuine constitutional text for the EU.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's two other priorities for 2003 have a close link with enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of ensuring stability and security throughout the EU is at the forefront of the Commission's concerns because the harmonious and peaceful coexistence of our people depends on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmony can only be achieved by balancing the fight against terrorism and crime with full respect for the freedoms and rights that are fundamental to our political and social model. And this will allow the EU to develop an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also step up surveillance of our external borders. This calls for special preparations on the part of the future Member States, which will have to control most of the EU's land borders.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to consolidate our policies on migration flows, asylum rights and the integration of immigrants who come in legally. The need to integrate legal immigrants into our societies must be put back at the centre of our immigration policy. After all, legal immigration boosts Europe's cultural and economic wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the EU is both expanding and deciding on its future structure, it is crucial to give new impetus to our policy towards the EU’s closest neighbours. Each day I am more and more convinced that we need to develop a comprehensive strategy <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the countries on the borders of the enlarged EU, stretching from Russia to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's definitive borders have recently become the centre of debate. Here I believe we must break with the reasoning that contrasts the countries on the inside with those on the outside. I realise this is not easy, but we need to work out and propose a new kind of partnership that makes use of all the instruments available.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not see our borders as a wall. But nor must we see them as rolling forward inexorably.</p>
<p class="contents">Our neighbourhood policy needs to be spelled out. We must come up to our neighbours' legitimate expectations, and our response must be based on cooperation. At the same time, we must press ahead with our political project for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission intends playing its full role on the international scene. In line with our traditional commitments, next year too we will work to consolidate stability in the Balkans. And we will spare no effort in the search to create new conditions that can finally bring peace to the Middle East.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>
<p class="contents">The third major priority for the coming year is economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current economic climate, people are rightly asking what the EU will do to help restore growth and create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that we must meet our objectives of sustainable economic prosperity and social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks ago, we discussed the coordination of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact in this house.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few days we will be putting forward proposals for improving the application of the Pact and for more coordinated management of budgetary policies within Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic aim is to put public finances on a sounder and more sustainable footing. This involves ensuring that the rules are implemented both intelligently and with authority so as to foster growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals form part of a more general strategy to strengthen economic policy coordination and governance. To that end, in 2003 we will improve the Commission's work of assessment and monitoring and its proactive role.</p>
<p class="contents">This will usher in a more flexible approach that can draw all our procedures together within a single coordination cycle. This will bring better synchronisation of the Spring Report on progress under the Lisbon Strategy with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">2003 will mark the tenth anniversary of the Single Market. We will report on the achievements and benefits it has brought EU citizens and consumers. But we must not forget that, though it represents a huge step forward, in some sectors the work is not over.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of services and particularly of financial services. 2003 is also the deadline we have set for the completion of the internal market for risk capital and securities.</p>
<p class="contents">These reforms will pave the way for easier financing of innovation, on which sustained growth and job creation rests in our economies. Innovation and investment in human resources and technology will feature high in the Commission's Spring Report next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Externally, the goal is to control and manage the process of globalisation so the largest possible number enjoy its benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The European integration project is viewed by all as the sole example of democratic management of globalisation. Our experience is unique and we must ensure the poorest regions of the planet in particular can draw on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year there is an important engagement scheduled for the Doha Development Agenda. In September the World Trade Organisation will be holding its ministerial-level meeting in Cancún. Both there and elsewhere, the Commission will ensure that the commitments entered into at Kyoto, Monterrey and Johannesburg are made good.</p>
<p class="contents">This means we must not disappoint the confidence the world has in us. And that means delivering in terms of intelligent management of the environment, trade and development.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>
<p class="contents">Everything I have said today is a clear illustration that the economic, social and environmental threads of our policies are all intertwined both in planning and in execution.</p>
<p class="contents">This development of our philosophy and approach was endorsed and given impetus by the conclusions of the Seville European Council last June.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative and work programme I am presenting today therefore represents a major step towards better European governance.</p>
<p class="contents">From next year on, the Commission will begin preliminary analyses of subsidiarity and proportionality in respect of around 40 selected proposals and will examine their economic, social and environmental impact. Such analyses will streamline and replace the Commission's current impact-assessment instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach needs to be applied pragmatically and progressively. From 2004 on, the method will be fully operational. It will then form an integral part of the whole legislative process, starting with the Annual Policy Strategy we will present in February and the legislative and the work programme to follow.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members,</p>
<p class="contents">This Work Programme seeks to bring more continuity and coherence to our political action through ever-closer cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions that led up to it confirm the soundness of the Community method. It gives the system the practical impact and political perspective the EU needs to achieve its goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The European integration project is now around half a century old. In historical terms it is still in its infancy. Each passing year is critical and may mark it enduringly.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of this, and yet 2003 will be quite special. To me the coming year will be crucial for Europe's history.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are all thinking actively about the EU's future, it is vital to bear in mind the full potential the EU could develop so we can see where reforms are really needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by calling on you all to think about that. May that thought serve to inspire and guide us, to bring us all closer together, and to heighten our awareness of the great responsibility we bear.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would like to emphasise the importance of this new method. For the first time, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have engaged in a constructive dialogue to establish a legislative programme. We are particularly in favour of this cooperation and especially of increasing initial discussions between Parliament and the Commission. Although this dialogue did indeed take place last spring, however, it was difficult to differentiate between this specific legislative planning exercise and what are known as regular meetings which take place throughout the year between parliamentary committees and commissioners in their respective fields of competence. In future we will probably need greater preparation and a better structure for this dialogue and, in particular, each Commissioner will probably have to present initial guidelines for each specific legislative field. The single document ‘Annual Policy Strategy for 2003’ presented by the Commission in February proved insufficient, and this situation could –appear harmful, as 2003 is a particularly important year due to enlargement. I did note, however, Mr President, that you would like the Commission to present monthly reports to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we welcome the three political priorities set by the Commission and we would like to make the following comments:</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, entitled ‘An enlarged Europe’, our primary concern is to ensure that the Community acquis is properly applied throughout the enlarged Union. It is therefore crucial for a codified version of Community law to be available in all the languages of the new Member States. Successful enlargement means including the environmental aspect and the objective of public health and consumer protection in all the other policies, as well as taking account – as you said yourself – of human resources, and it also means being innovative. Lastly, it means monitoring the application of Community legislation, and we will need to help the future Member States to establish suitable structures as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second point, entitled ‘Stability and security’, the terrorist threat hangs over the Union. We therefore welcome the measures proposed in order to combat this scourge. Combating terrorism is one factor in a broader objective, that of ensuring that the Union is safe and secure. We also welcome the Commission’s commitment to move forward in creating an area of freedom, security and justice, within which the rights of the individual will be protected, whether in terms of civil protection, food and industrial safety, transport, energy or land use planning, in order to take into consideration all the factors affecting public health and the environment. With regard, more particularly, to establishing a European Public Prosecutor, we believe it is appropriate to await the Convention’s conclusions on the subject before taking any initiatives. Ensuring stability and security within the Union also means defining and setting up an integrated border-control system and taking coordinated practical action to combat illegal immigration. We would also ask the Commission to present proposals in the near future on asylum and immigration policy that clearly distinguish between asylum seekers, those requesting international protection and migrant workers. On this subject, our group is still concerned about what we perceive as a lack of resolve within the Council. It is also important to monitor the actions of the European Union and the Member States regularly with regard to the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">On the third point, entitled ‘Sustainable and inclusive economy’, if we want to prevent the deterioration in the economic environment from having a negative impact on employment, it would be desirable for the Commission to be able to inform us of proposals for a more flexible working market, which is essential for increasing employment opportunities. We appreciate the Commission’s firm stance over the Stability and Growth Pact, but, on the other hand, we consider it lacking in other areas. It is regrettable that the Commission programme makes no mention of the fiscal package and that no progress has been made in the field of VAT with regard to the principle of country of origin. In particular, we would invite the Commission to go further in considering the harmonisation of the basis for taxation, wherever this is necessary for the proper functioning of the single market, while not proposing a measure aimed solely at harmonising rates. The European Union’s fiscal policy must, in all cases, be aimed at reducing general taxation and lowering administrative costs. Economic development is also achieved through strengthening infrastructures, in particular in the field of transport. We would also, following the ruling of the Court of Justice of 5 November 2002, which found eight Member States guilty of concluding ‘open sky’ agreements with the United States, call for the European Commission to present a communication on drawing up future bilateral agreements in the field of air transport as swiftly as possible. With regard to the Union’s foreign policy, we would ask the Commission to publish a Green Paper on the new borders of the enlarged European Union, supplemented by ideas on relations with the new neighbouring States and the various partners. It is regrettable that the Commission legislative programme makes no reference to either the creation of a Euromed free trade area, or the creation of a Euromed parliamentary assembly. Within the context of post-Doha discussions, we would ask the Commission how it hopes to be able to integrate the commitment of Europe, no longer of fifteen, but of twenty-five States. Lastly, trans-Atlantic dialogue must be strengthened in a spirit of sustainable and inclusive development and must of course make good the Kyoto commitments. We are pleased that the proposal puts forward seven strategies as indicated in the Sixth Environment Action Programme, as well as proposals concerning integrated product policy and a new chemicals strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important to begin to reform employee status, make OLAF more independent and publish declarations of the financial interests of commissioners and directors-general on the Internet. I am sure, Mr President, that in this way we will be able to avoid an exponential increase in measures, duplicated criteria as well as– and I shall end here – excessive transposition work, in order to ensure the best possible future for the enlargement of the Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting increasingly close to what we asked for at the beginning of the legislature, that is, an annual political programme presented to Parliament with the participation of the Council – and I hope that Minister Haarder’s presence here is not superfluous and that he can also participate by responding to our comments, in line with visibility, transparency and democratic control. In this context, Mr President, please allow me to refer to a phrase that is in the programme – and which I believe is an error by the ‘hack’ who wrote it – which states that the programme provides the Commission’s input to the Council’s annual working programme. Could the President of the Commission clarify for us what this sentence means? Because what we believe is that Parliament is not taken into account and the Commission is reduced to the role of secretariat of the Council, and we disagree entirely with this kind of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to focus on the three great priorities mentioned by the President and I will leave it to other Members to deal with specific aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, we spoke about this yesterday. Within the Community acquis, we attach great importance to the strengthening of the social dimension in the candidate countries, except in relation to the areas in which we believe the Commission should make more effort. And, apart from holding discussions – the final phase of the negotiations is yet to take place – there are certain issues which we should remember. For example, we are struck by the fact that in the report of the Court of Auditors this year it says that in the SAPAR pre-accession programme, only one million euros has been spent, which is 0.1%. We are always discussing quantities, but we must look at how they are spent and invested. We must debate this issue not only with the Commission, but also with our friends and, I hope very soon, neighbours, in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the economic issue, which is absolutely central, we can see that the spirit of Lisbon and Gothenburg are still alive within the Commission. However, we must recognise that recent events have demonstrated that we are not playing a central role in terms of economic growth and, above all, there is a concern that economic governance is not being strengthened – and we will have to see what is happening in the Convention’s working group. In the long term, a monetary union which is not consolidated by an economic union and a political union is not viable; history has taught us this and we must take it very much into account in order to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point on the economic and social priorities. As well as sustainable development, you, in relation to the framework directive on services of general interest, which was agreed in Barcelona, are proposing a Green Paper. We prefer a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to stability and security, apart from the priority of terrorism, which is absolutely universal, the Swedish Presidency proposed a consideration of the demographic future of Europe. This should be linked to the issue of immigration. We welcome the fact – and in particular I am referring to the Members on the Right of the House – that you defend the role of legal immigration in relation to our welfare societies and our demographic future, but, in any event – and I am addressing the Council – I believe it would be very positive if there were a more active approach.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the debate on the borders of Europe, you have spoken of the spirit and soul – I believe in lay terms – for all Europeans. Our former colleague, Mrs Palacio, Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that Europe is not a Christian club. I welcome this comment, which I believe is absolutely correct. In any event – also in relation to the Convention – it is important that we find formulae for qualified association.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to comment on the elements missing from the programme. The status of political parties is not included as a priority. Now that the Treaty of Nice has been approved, it is essential to make rapid progress in this regard in order to consolidate a fundamental element of European democracy. The Commission had already made a transitional proposal, even beforehand. Secondly, we are going to vote on a resolution – I believe with a large majority in this House – relating to freedom of expression and media concentration. In this regard, we would welcome a more dynamic attitude on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I will end here, Mr President, there is an issue which worries us very much: the agreements of the General Affairs Council last Monday. We have noted, from what we have been told and from leaks, that the President of the Commission is concerned to find a final date for the mandate of this Commission. I always thought that you would be a Commission that would be operational from the day of the elections. In any event, this is a constitutional issue. We are opposed to the General Affairs Council, without having debated the issue with Parliament and without you having presented it, taking a unilateral decision containing many elements which clearly clash with the Treaties. We therefore ask – and I address this to you, Mr President, so that it may be communicated to the President of Parliament – that the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on this important issue be raised by the President in Copenhagen and I would like to hear an explanation today by both the President of the Commission and the Council.</p>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/mepphoto/4518.jpg" align="right" width="50" height="63" onerror="this.onerror='';this.src='/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif'" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, the ELDR Group has always been quite critical in the past of the somewhat incoherent and arbitrary nature of previous annual programmes. We have always looked for two things in this programme: firstly, a clear idea of the political direction reflected in the strategic choices taken by the European Commission, and secondly, a political debate between the institutions themselves. There has certainly been some progress on those two counts this year, compared to previous years. We wish to thank the Commission for keeping to the format and timetable of the new arrangements and certainly thank the college for being present in such great numbers here today. However, as President Prodi himself said, there is still some room for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group would like to highlight three areas where we feel there should be further improvement. The European Commission aspires to be an EU government of sorts. Good governments make strategic choices. They set political priorities. That importantly means they explain what they are not going to do as well as what they are going to do. The concern we have is that, even in this improved document, the three priorities are so broad and open-ended that they do not really represent any meaningful political choice. This is reflected in the annexes. The annex covering the actions undertaken under the three priorities run to around 40 pages. More worryingly, the annex covering the issues which fall outside the priorities runs to 50 pages. In other words, we are faced with the prospect that the majority of the initiatives undertaken on the basis of this annual programme next year will actually fall outside the political orientation set in the annual programme altogether. That is simply not the way to proceed. Once again this resorts to a sort of laundry list approach to legislative initiative and we as a group would like to see a much greater display of choice and political orientation as regards what the European Commission proposes to do from one year to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the level of detail provided for each proposed legislative action. This has certainly improved compared with previous years but that was not difficult. It is still not sufficient and I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that in the Convention there are proposals being floated to involve national parliaments in this debate in future. This annex is almost incomprehensible to MEPs so it would be utterly incomprehensible to MPs in national parliaments. It needs to be explained in clear, cogent, simple prose so that it is comprehensible to people living in the world that exists outside the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third point is our strong support for the Commission's stated intention of applying impact assessments to a number of pilot initiatives. We feel impact assessments are absolutely indispensable to improve the quality of European legislation but we would like to take it a step further in two important respects. Firstly, we do not feel that in the long run the Commission can be judge and jury on its own impact assessments – assessing its own draft proposals. We feel this should be done independently. Secondly, there is little point in the Commission conducting its impact assessments if parliamentary and Council amendments then escape impact assessments altogether. Therefore we would like to see an interinstitutional approach which applies impact assessments at all points of the legislative cycle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boudjenah (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the three political priorities of your programme can only be assessed in light of the challenges faced by the European Union. It should, however, and I shall say this from the start, be noted that the ultra-liberal criteria that continue to affect European integration prevent us from rising to meet these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thus proposes, and I quote, to ‘re-engage citizens in the European project’. I will believe that when I see it! The abyss is in fact deepening between European integration as it is and the peoples’ expectations, as expressed in particular at the European Social Forum in Florence, where hundreds of thousands of people were united in a powerful anti-war, pro-peace demonstration. The Union, however, continues to implement a security and defence policy based on the military option and alliance with NATO, instead of working towards conflict prevention. Numerous discussions, debates and demonstrations in Florence called for public services to be safeguarded, so that water, health and education might become common assets. A petition against liberalising services under the WTO, within the framework of the GATS has already been signed by 127 European and national MPs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, on the other hand, in accordance with the Barcelona and Lisbon European Councils, is pursuing and speeding up the liberalisation and deregulation process leading to privatisation in the energy, transport, postal and other sectors. It is maintaining the restrictions on public spending under the Stability and Growth Pact, even though it has been recognised at the highest level that the Pact is not as intangible as it seems.</p>
<p class="contents">After Florence, French rail workers will take to the streets again on 26 November. In Florence, young people declared themselves in favour of a fraternal, inclusive Europe that is open to the world. The Commission programme makes fortress Europe even more impenetrable. This effective border control, however, is entirely illusory and distances us further from the inclusive Europe you spoke of yesterday morning, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">Common asylum and immigration policies must not be dependent on combating terrorism, an approach that would consider anything foreign to be potentially dangerous and criminalise all migrants or would view them as nothing more than economic resource.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the road to equal rights could lead to a safe, inclusive European Union. By equal rights, I mean economic, social and political rights equally: granting foreign residents the right to vote as of the next European elections in 2004, as Commissioner Vitorino advocated before one of the Convention’s working groups, would send a strong signal in this regard for a generous, fraternal Europe that is open to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is certainly an urgent need to define the future of Europe, but I do not believe we should define it in the same way as the Commission’s design and project. Must we confine ourselves to the Convention’s limited ideas concerning the institutions and rhetoric on the social dimension, must we place our trust fully in the Convention, as you said, Mr Prodi? It is not enough simply to announce that citizens are to be involved. We need to respond to their needs and hopes and fully recognise their rights, with regard to work, health, housing, education and culture, and in order to do so, we must certainly go back to the drawing board and rethink the most basic principles of the Maastricht Treaty, as it imposes a dogma of competition and a free market. We must challenge the Stability and Growth Pact and take account of the new criteria of growth, employment and training and review the responsibilities of the European Central Bank. The ruling on liberalisation and deregulation must be promulgated, public services must be recognised in the Treaty, and not only as a derogation to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Prodi, you spoke of the great hopes that exist in the South. I share this ambition for the European Union to play a new role in the world, to prevent conflicts, to encourage peace and genuine security. The Union should play a part in international negotiations, in particular within the WTO, and espouse concerns over genuine development in the poorest countries. In this regard, confining ourselves to the limited Monterrey commitments or the HIPC initiative is feeble, when what we should be doing instead is cancelling all the debts of the Southern countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, although the Commission has stated its ambition to play a part in resolving the Middle East conflict, I would like to see more political initiatives being taken instead of just words, particularly in the spirit of Mr Patten’s regular position statements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I do, however, feel that we should be basing our assessment of this legislative programme on the agenda for sustainable development, outside as well as within the European Union. I am afraid to say, President Prodi, that your programme is rather vague on this point, not to say slightly rhetorical. We hope that, this time, the Commission’s report on sustainable development, due to be presented at the Spring Summit, will not arrive at the last minute. Equally, we hope that, as part of the follow up to Johannesburg, it might be possible to publish the annual report on the partnership initiatives on water and energy which, as you are aware, are part of what are known as the type two agreements concluded at Johannesburg, in due time.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative programme mentions the importance of the success of the Cancún meeting. However, we feel that the European Parliament must be involved in the debate on what the Commission is going to do and say in Cancún. We really do not want a repeat of the absolutely disgraceful situation at Johannesburg, where we were faced with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, an agreement already concluded between the Commission – or perhaps the Commissioner responsible, for that mystery has yet to be cleared up – and the United States, that WTO rules should take precedence over international agreements in environmental matters. This venture was partly foiled at Johannesburg, but we genuinely fear that something similar might happen at Cancún, without any public debate and going completely against the endeavours the Commission itself is making in the area of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the external dimension of sustainable development, I would also point out that, although it is true that impact and sustainability assessments are now necessary for all international agreements – and this is a positive innovation which we very much welcome and with which we are very satisfied – it is also true that it is difficult to realise this undertaking, not least because of a certain lack of resources, as is shown by the work carried out on the agreement with Chile, work which was, I regret to say, inaccurate and rushed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward with great interest, Mr President, to the Commission’s Green Paper on services of general interest, and it is our genuine hope that it will be possible to discuss it here in Parliament too, Chairman Barón Crespo. Moreover, we hope that it will be possible to produce a directive on the matter as well, not least in that we fear that there might be some inconsistency – as I said just now – between what the Commission says and does in the Union and what it then proceeds to negotiate at international level, particularly within the WTO, which is now extremely powerful.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in this International Year of Mountains, President Prodi, knowing your passion for mountains, we would like to know what measures the Commission intends to adopt for the practical implementation of the Alps Convention, particularly the protocol on transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Another environmental issue which we feel needs attention but which I am afraid is no longer part of the programme is PVC, a material which is recognised to be highly dangerous by at least five Commission ongoing studies. We were expecting a communication before the end of the summer but it appears that, after Commissioner Liikanen announced his position, all the work was stopped. I am citing this example, although it may seem a minor issue, because, although it is true that we are working constructively to improve the legislative programme, it is also true that our discussions do not serve much purpose if we then lose sight of major legislative proposals, firmly supported by Parliament, which appear as part of the programme for years and then suddenly disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by expressing our deep concern at the influence of industrial lobbies on the Commission’s choice of legislative instrument, which may even not be a proper legislative instrument, and I would also point out that this issue is a very specific part of the interinstitutional agreement which, together with other Members of Parliament, we are trying to conclude before the Copenhagen European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poli Bortone (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to start by apologising to President Prodi for the improvised nature of this speech, which will be a series of brief reflections on what I have read or heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, over and above the indications given in the work programme for 2003, we cannot expect the Commission to do everything immediately and, ideally, properly, in the space of just one year, but it is right that guidelines should be laid down, as has been done. I feel that, at least in general terms, these guidelines are sufficiently acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to your speech, President Prodi, and I very much appreciated some of the points which you stressed with your usual enthusiasm, particularly the social considerations, which are very relevant at a time when we are discussing security, solidarity and measures which could even include a new direction for the world of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if I may, I would like to call upon the Commission and the Community institutions in general to reflect either formally or informally on a number of policies which I believe are of vital importance for the future of Europe, particularly for the future of an enlarged Europe which is genuinely united as regards its fundamental principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, yesterday, we held lengthy formal and informal discussions with many members of parliaments whose countries are aspiring, if I may use that expression, to become a full members of Europe, and, together, we discussed our desire to work towards achieving a Europe which is genuinely, essentially and, ideally, politically united. However, in order to be politically united and cohesive, Europe needs to address issues of momentous historical importance transparently.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe we need to reflect very deeply on the issue of immigration. There can never be enough discussion of the subject of legal immigration, just as there can never be enough discussion on the integration of immigrants. I often reflect – and I still do not know the answer – on the problem of integrating immigrants into society, and I sometimes wonder whether integration is not another, new form of oppression of cultures which are different from ours and should therefore be fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the speakers mentioned the subject of an interesting debate just now, which took place both in Florence and in my own town, Lecce, a town where we have to have no fear of dialogue or the presence of people who do not think in the same way as we do. Here, too, we must listen to what is being said about globalisation, about new forms of poverty which genuinely exist, on north and south, east and west. We must reflect still more – I reiterate – on the way we may, to some extent, be oppressing immigrant or emigrant peoples which, I imagine, would like to return to their homelands and regain their identities and their cultural roots, but which certainly do not want to go back to economic poverty. Therefore, if we have to take economic measures, it is essential that we ensure that these do not lead to the oppression of cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this, therefore, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission to the issues of immigration and employment, in order to avoid employment, rather than being a uniting factor, becoming grounds for fresh dispute between the immigrants in our States and those who need to convert their business activities. Consider the industrial crisis in our country, President Prodi, and the resulting need to retrain the work force through substantial, genuinely incisive, large-scale training measures. Training is also something which depends on culture, and it must be promoted if it is true that Europe wants to continue to grow, as you maintain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission’s three main priorities are a logical choice for its work programme for 2003. Preparation for enlargement is a top priority that is rightly seen by the European Commission as an exercise in managing the diversity of cultures, administrative traditions and economic structures. Likewise stability and security as a second priority receive my unqualified support. Fighting terrorism, management of the new external borders and control of illegal immigration are very important for both the current and the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now however I should like to take a closer look at the third priority: sustainable development. While I am of course pleased that sustainable development remains a priority for the European Commission, there is more to it than that. It is solemnly promised that special attention will be paid to the impact of new legislation on the environment. In Annex 2 however I see that the main focus of attention is on completion of the internal market. I am of course curious about the announcement of the inclusion of the environment in EU legislation. I am also concerned about the status of this document. There is a great danger that it will again end up as a discussion document, resulting in fine words and intentions but not meaning anything concrete in terms of legislation. There is certainly plenty of scope for improvement in the energy and transport fields. I do not in fact see many initiatives in the area of environmental legislation. Perhaps this is not injudicious in the light of the problems with the implementation and enforcement of existing environmental legislation. It may also well be that over the next few years we shall no longer be able to develop more far-reaching legislation in a Union of 25 members.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often pressed for a proposal to review the Batteries Directive. I know that work on this review has been going on for years, but reaching agreement internally is impossible. It is high time that the proposed amendment was sent to Parliament and the Council. I should like to hold you to the promise of March 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Commission work programme for 2003 is better presented than in the past. It is clearly based around important priorities and that is a point in its favour. The form, however, is still highly ambiguous. We are told that this programme will contribute to the Council’s annual operational programme for 2003, which the Council is due to subsequently adopt in December. But what is the exact status of the Commission’s contribution? Should the Council accept it as it is or does it have the right to amend it to introduce new priorities? Only the latter hypothesis is coherent with the hierarchy of the institutions. Naturally, we have no doubt that, in practice, dialogue within the institutional triangle will make it possible to iron out this problem. It nonetheless raises an important matter of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority of the Commission programme is essentially to prepare for enlargement. We cannot fail to be impressed, when reading the actions to be taken in this regard, by their sheer number, which shows the scale of the Community acquis to be implemented by the candidate countries. Having listened to the representatives of these countries yesterday, having heard their reactions, we can clearly see that these countries are keen to enter the Union. They want to become part of the European family and are ready to make a great deal of effort to accomplish that. We must not, however, exhaust them with excess legislation and authority. We must have the wisdom to let them work at their own pace and accept variable geometry to a greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme’s second priority is entitled ‘Stability and security’ and this presents in particular measures relating to immigration. Having read the list of key initiatives several times, I must say that I did find the initiative concerning integration of legal immigrants, but I am still looking for the initiative that was supposed to cover repatriation of illegal immigrants. If it is there, it is well hidden. This quite simply shows that the Commission still has a long way to go before realising the scale of the problem we are facing today.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, in conclusion, we would like to convey our compliments on the paragraph entitled ‘Relations with the enlarged EU’s neighbours’, which Mr Prodi emphasised earlier. These relations must indeed be redefined and in this respect the Euro-Mediterranean partnership could lead to the creation of a new community, which, it must be said, would be separate from the current one. It would be more natural for Turkey to be a part of that community rather than be part of the European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am going to meet him this afternoon, and I feel this is important precisely because I believe that we need powerful, direct dialogue on these matters. Indeed, the issues on the table are the most far-reaching, most fundamental matters, and I therefore feel it is appropriate to analyse them in some depth, as I am going to do in Brussels this afternoon, as I said.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, I want to respond to the first criticisms. I will then leave my colleagues from the Commission the task of developing the themes and exploring them in more detail. Indeed, there are a number of issues which are absolutely essential for our future action.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Grossetête mentioned our plans for the Mediterranean. I fully agree with her. I myself have on many occasions found myself in an awkward situation because of the way all the leaders of the Mediterranean countries criticise the Commission directly, accusing us of favouring Eastern Europe over them. My response has been simple: the demands of history have led us to take that road, but it is our intention, firstly, to strengthen the Barcelona policy, with whose development we are still encountering major problems, and secondly, to define the new policy which I have outlined – the ring of friends sharing everything except institutions with the Union – which, this is the point, I hope the Greek and Italian Presidencies will help to boost next year, given that we are going to have two consecutive Mediterranean presidencies in the same year. I have already discussed these matters and the Commission’s desire to fulfil its responsibilities in this area with the Greeks, and I will discuss them with the Italians subsequently too, for I feel that this is an extremely important issue. Moreover, I call upon Parliament as of now to strengthen our joint action in the field of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the subject of our working methods, this is the age-old question of interinstitutional cooperation. It is a wide-ranging issue with major political implications, on which, however, there are a whole series of operational decisions to be taken, for we cannot limit ourselves to making declarations of principle. The Mediterranean policy will require us to take decisions affecting the budget and our whole way of working. I therefore feel that, as far as this matter is concerned, it is imperative that we focus primarily on interinstitutional programming.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, Mrs Grossetête mentioned the need for each Commissioner to present a preliminary report to the Parliamentary committee concerned. I have no objection to this. Indeed, it could be useful, precisely because this is a new process which we need to improve. We will assess this proposal and I am sure we will take on board the sense of it. The only thing I want to avoid is the danger of fragmentation. There are a number of points at which, despite the need for in-depth analysis, we need to focus on the overall picture, specifically at the stage of the preliminary proposal at the beginning of the process and again when the final decision is taken at the end of the process. I would like these two stages to remain plenary debates. Clearly, there will be times during the debate when technical, specific points need to be discussed – we have no objection to that – but the beginning and end of the debate are a matter for all of us, not just some of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo, first of all, the proposal on the Commission’s programme is usually determined by the relationship between the Commission and Parliament, which is extremely delicate. I would point out that the Commission’s programme for 2003 focuses on new initiatives whereas the Council’s programme, with very few exceptions, deals with initiatives which have already been presented by the Commission but which have not been adopted. In this sense, it is on our relationship with the Council that we need to focus, for we now have a backlog of issues which Parliament has already dealt with. Of course, the Commission fully supports the European Parliament – we have been consistent in our support – ensuring that the Council involves Parliament on all the points of its programme. Moreover, the Commission defines the political priorities for the Council, and it has already presented them to the General Affairs Council of 18 November. In this regard, we should have a close relationship with the Greek Presidency too.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the point raised by Mr Barón Crespo concerning the political parties’ statute, we will present the new proposal as soon as it enters into force. We are in full agreement with you as regards its importance, but we are just waiting for the right moment to present the proposal, which must be discussed by everybody together.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the interinstitutional resolutions for 2004, I feel that what Mr Barón Crespo said is extremely important, and I fully agree with him. The Commission has constantly drawn the presidency’s attention to the need to find solutions which will not upset the smooth functioning of the institutions. An agreement with Parliament is clearly necessary. When it became clear that there was a sort of legislative traffic jam, the Commission immediately made it clear that there needs to be coordination between Parliament’s rhythm of work and the rhythm of work of the Commission. We immediately stressed that the new Parliament must work in tandem with the new Commission right from the start. As I see it, these decisions are highly necessary, but we are short of time because solutions have to be found before Copenhagen. I think we could discuss this proposal at the interinstitutional summit at the end of November/beginning of December with a view precisely to achieving an agreement before Copenhagen. I must stress the vital importance of this matter because what we have to avoid is a scenario in which we have the new Parliament, a Commission that will only be in office for three months and then a new Commission, with all the organs changing and, as a result, a complete breakdown in some areas of the system. We are extremely concerned about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully share Mrs Frassoni’s concerns regarding sustainable development, about which Commissioner Wallström is going to speak later on. Commissioner Nielson is going to talk about Johannesburg and Vice-President de Palacio is going to talk about transport. I would point out that our position at Johannesburg was very strong but also very uncomfortable. I am not ashamed to say that the countries of the Developing World, the African countries particularly in this case – indeed, Africa is the real major problem – are tending to make less and less of a distinction between Europe, the United States and other countries. This is something which should concern us all. Despite the fact that, in recent years, we have been acting in a genuinely responsible manner – consider Kyoto, the Everything but Arms initiative, incisive decisions opening up our markets unilaterally, incisive decisions regarding the Kyoto Protocol, incisive decisions on many aspects of development aid, for example in Monterrey, where it was we who obtained the minimum that could be obtained as regards foreign aid, even though it really was an absolute minimum – we must not be surprised if the developing world reacts by lumping us all together without distinction. This is a matter of great concern which requires very thorough analysis on our part. This is the way we must approach the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A further concern, expressed by Mrs Boudjenah, relates to the interpretation of peace and development issues overall, as a matter for general concern. I agree – as I said before – with this too. As regards matters such as the pluralism of the world and multilateralism, it is even more important that we adopt a role of absolute leadership because there is no one else who can keep these debates open, and we know how valuable they are at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be said, quite frankly, that these are debates which can be kept open in a credible manner if there is a financial commitment, and that is very difficult to fulfil at this time. I therefore believe that we genuinely ought to open an in-depth political debate on this because, clearly, if we do not engage sufficient resources, we will be merely moralising to these countries rather than capable of changing the situation in the world. I would stress: we have done a great deal and we have played an exemplary role. We must continue to do so but we must improve both the quality and quantity of our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the last part of Mrs Poli Bortone’s speech, which concerned immigration. It is true that we need to focus on legal as well as illegal immigration, it is true that the issue of integrating immigrants is something that needs to be discussed, but, first and foremost, there is the major issue to be resolved of whether or not integration is taking place. I have to say, however, that, for the most part, the immigrants who come to Europe are increasingly stable, increasingly willing to become integrated into the societies of our European countries, wherever they come from, and they become integrated more easily and to a greater degree in some cases than in others. I do, in any case, believe that, for the sake of the future cohesion of our societies, we must make a huge effort to facilitate integration as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress that it is an issue whose facets and characteristics vary greatly according to the country of origin and reception, but the risk of our societies becoming fragmented is a risk we cannot take.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a very powerful personal experience for me to visit different communities of Italian immigrants in Germany and Belgium over the years. Wherever I have seen that total integration has taken place, I have realised that this was the only way for them to live happy, serene lives on an equal footing with their fellow citizens. Total integration is, in my opinion, a major objective for an open society, and it must take place in full respect for all cultures, in full respect for diversities, with a view to achieving societies which are not afflicted by conflict or tensions. Clearly, this means that we need an immigration policy which is much more complex and much more cohesive than that we have been working on hitherto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights had an opportunity for constructive dialogue with two Commissioners, Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou and Mr Antonio Vitorino. We had a most productive discussion, during which our opinions and positions converged on numerous points. In the light of that positive experience, I was surprised – and I wondered why – I was unable to find a single word on gender equality in the Commission programme for 2003. Mrs Diamantopoulou assured us at a meeting with our committee at the beginning of October that gender equality policy was a Commission priority and we have heard nothing to make us think otherwise. As you know, the Committee on Women's Rights has the exclusive privilege of being invited once a year to a one-day meeting with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and ten Commissioners, in order to discuss the specific issue of gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">2003 is an important year for the Committee on Women's Rights. The top priority is the Convention on the future of Europe and we have invested a great deal of time and effort in order to ensure that the new Treaty promotes gender equality. Secondly, we need the acquis communautaire<span class="italic"> </span>on women to be applied, not just adopted by the candidate countries. Τhirdly, there is the question of gender mainstreaming and, of course, we still have a great deal to do to put our own house in order here. In all events, I welcome the initiative to put the Commission's annual progress report on sexual equality on the agenda for the spring summit under the Greek presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important priority is to ensure there is a balanced representation of the sexes at the 2004 European Parliament elections. The European Parliament and the Commission should set a standard for the other institutions. Finally, I am worried and concerned about the fact that the proposal for a new directive on combating sexual discrimination on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty keeps being postponed. Have we any news on this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For now, there is no reason to be optimistic. According to the Commission, the indicators continue to point to an acceleration in growth at the end of 2002. This acceleration, however, will not exceed 1%, which means, and I quote, that a rate of growth of around 3% therefore seems impossible to achieve for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk of a stock market crash, the impact of terrorism and the threat of war have significantly marked the world economy. We could adopt a dogmatic stance in response to this situation, superstitiously chanting ‘stability, stability’. We could also aim for a more pragmatic economic policy by giving growth a boost. That is what the US Government has done, injecting more than USD 100 billion into the economy in one year. That is what the Federal Reserve has done through its policy of lowering interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, as socialists, stability is important. We must fight against public debt and for a balanced budget. The right has attacked the German Government for this, pretending to forget that right-wing governments in Portugal, Italy and in particular France, are moving ever further from the stability policy. The socialists, however, advocate a proactive policy in favour of growth and employment, because in politics chanting has never produced results. Now is the time to relaunch trans-European networks and use all available appropriations to foster productive investment, research and the knowledge-based economy. It is truly scandalous to see that the Commission was incapable of using all the available appropriations in 2001. Even though the Union budget is just 1% of the Community gross domestic product, 16% of these scant appropriations were unused, in other words, saved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall end by saying that the Union set itself an ambitious strategy at the Lisbon Summit, and we must provide ourselves with the means to fulfil that ambition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to establish that against the background of the Lisbon process, against the background of a growing demand for labour participation, against the background of requests for flexibility in the labour market and against the background of labour mobility in Europe, the Commission’s programme, and in particular its legislative programme, is lacking in ambition as far as we are concerned, and that we think is a pity.</p>
<p class="contents">2003 threatens to be a lost year in this regard, certainly if we look at the legislation. There are only three proposals that go in the right direction. They are concerned with equal treatment, which has already been mentioned, the normal guidelines for employment and social security 140871. They are not new legislative proposals, though; they are amendments. We also note that delays are occurring in a number of areas or there is even the odd omission, as is the case with the European works council, which is not on the agenda for next year or perhaps only at the end of it. There is also a lack of initiative in the fields of parental leave, the protection of women workers, the disabled and atypical work, and I could go on.</p>
<p class="contents">As a committee we have to note that on the legislative side the programme is not really satisfactory when it comes to the demands that are made by society and that are also socially based. We have already spent some time discussing this in our committee and with our Commissioner. We also believe that the problem does not lie with the Commissioner alone, but also and in particular with the Commission as such and with the Council. We therefore ask the Council in particular to take steps on the occasion of the forthcoming mid-term review of the social agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We must prepare this with the Commission and I hope that we can then make progress. At the moment there is really no chance of this happening and we are disappointed to a certain extent. But we live in hope and that is why we are asking that these steps be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I read in a wide range of newspapers this morning that a pill has been discovered that may well enable us to live to the age of 150.</p>
<p class="contents">While I was on my way to Parliament, I remembered what it was I had to ask the Commission. While I have always been aware that Europe is now beginning to concern itself with pensions – and I have to say that last year’s Commission rightly addressed the issue with particular enthusiasm, with, I believe, the support of the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou – even though the area is still the responsibility of the Member States, I have noticed that many governments, including, not least, the government governing me, Carlo Fatuzzo, too, are making statements which will lead the European citizens to believe that it is Europe which is going to cut their pensions, that it is Europe that is going to reduce their pension income, that it is Europe that is going to force them to tighten their belts. However, it is they, the national governments, which have to take these decisions, and if they are going to be forced to cut pension payments, then they must make that clear openly, frankly and honestly to their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you, Commission Vice-President, what the Commission intends to do to make the European citizens aware that Commissioner Diamantopoulou is not a fairy or a sorceress who is able to grant wealth to all the citizens but an evil ogre who is doing what the national governments tell her to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has now achieved the major objectives established at the beginning of its term of office – enlargement and the reforms – but I feel that, in the final stage of its term of office, it must do more than just manage and implement what has already been achieved. I feel that the paragraphs entitled ‘Defining the future of Europe’ and ‘Relations with the enlarged EU’s neighbours’ are the key to the realisation that we need to start laying the foundations for the Union’s future political outlook as of now.</p>
<p class="contents">After the accession we hope for of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, we must turn our gaze resolutely in three directions: towards Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans and the Mediterranean. I welcome the openness displayed in the sentence ‘…the Stabilisation and Association process opens perspectives for membership’. I therefore agree with what President Prodi said: we must develop a ring of friends stretching from Russia to Morocco, without excluding the possibility of them acceding to the Union under the same conditions as the other countries which have already become part of it.</p>
<p class="contents">This opens horizons for the future which will extend our project even beyond the geographical confines of our continent. While we are preparing to launch the widest and, perhaps, most important enlargement of the Union, we need to be aware of these possibilities. In any case, when Russia accedes to the Union – however far in the future – we will not be able to stipulate that only the part on this side of the Urals can do so, and that will bring great changes, particularly in the way the Union defines itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore see the Union as a ring of concentric circles which are interconnected. This is the way for Europe to continue to keep its soul alive. The day when Europe ceases to concern itself with the countries beyond its borders will be the day when it loses part of its basic <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have said that we want faster spending because far too much remains unspent at the moment. In practice however this is still not happening. My specific question to you is: what new steps will you be taking to achieve this in your work programme for 2003? You have also said that we must spend better, we want to move towards basic social spending such as education. You have accepted a figure of 35%, you have reached an average of 28%. What specific steps will you be taking to achieve this in your programme for 2003?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in Doha you took on the obligation to table proposals for the reduction of the agricultural subsidies and their conversion into rural subsidies before March 2003. When can we expect these concrete proposals in the area of agriculture, as a supplement to the Fischler package?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, you promised to bring forward a supplement to the regulation of the gap between structural aid and emergency aid. This gap, the famous grey zone, is sometimes giving rise to one or two years’ delay. When can we expect to see this specific regulation?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, and in conclusion, in the context of migration policy – and Mr Prodi also made reference to this – you said that there is a need to conclude new partnership agreements with developing countries. The specific question is: what initiatives will you be presenting in this area in addition to the Cotonou Treaty that will actually do something about a regulated migration policy which – and let us start with North Africa and a number of the suppliers from the different regions – actually involves the relationship with the developing countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At present we seem to have all our attention on enlargement, but we must fight tooth and nail to hold on to the Lisbon objectives. Enlargement will place burdens on the EU economy, and that underlines the importance of having a competitive strategy to address that problem. For this reason, we must also be able to implement some difficult reforms at the same time as enlargement. We have to focus our attention on the applicant countries’ ability to implement the Lisbon objectives. In the old Member States too it is necessary to give attention to the implementation of EU legislation. When enlargement takes place we shall particularly have to avoid distortions of competition due to the uneven implementation of directives, for example, in environmental and competition policy. The liberalisation process must be speeded up substantially in the electricity, gas, telecommunications and transport sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation at present is that consumers cannot count on economic growth. Investment is being put off and the markets are still constrained. Labour costs are high while at the same time there is considerable unemployment in Europe. Faith in the Stability and Growth Pact is being shaken.</p>

Most of the players in the labour markets across Europe know absolutely nothing about the European Employment Strategy. The Commission is aware of this and has started to stress the importance of implementation, which I welcome wholeheartedly. When I last heard Mrs Diamantopoulou speak to our committee, she said that there would also be further consideration of how to include the European Parliament and the national parliaments in the European employment process. I think this sounds excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">My question now is whether the Commission has progressed any further on this issue and has clearer ideas in this regard. If we look at each individual Member State, they all have some sort of national action plan for employment in as much as their parliaments have adopted budgets which establish which measures in the area of labour market policy have funding for the coming year. As there cannot be two separate national action plans, the national action plan which is part of, and builds on, the guidelines in the European employment process must be coordinated with each parliament’s politico-economic work on creating a national employment policy. I therefore wonder why the Commission is not clearer on this point. I know that telling Member States how to handle their decision-making processes is not an option, but making recommendations is obviously possible, not least within the framework of the open employment process.</p>
<p class="contents">With this now about to be introduced in the candidate countries, which have a weak administrative capacity, it is even more important to place the political responsibility for the employment process clearly on the political process and to emphasise that the national parliaments have a crucial responsibility for, and influence upon, this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been much progress in this field and in the field of cooperation in criminal matters and we have demonstrated that when we have political will we can be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask whether you believe that now is the time, following this success in relation to cooperation in the criminal field, to carry out the necessary improvement in judicial standards in the European Union and the defence of individual rights. And I am referring to the current Union and the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe – and I would like to hear the Commission’s opinion on this – that there should be some coordination initiative in the police field which would put an end to these areas of confusion, which are so difficult to explain to the citizens. I am referring to Europol and others.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less optimistic about immigration policy, however. There is a phrase in the work programme which I find truly extraordinary: to consolidate the immigration and asylum policy. I do not believe it is the fault of the European Commission, I am more than sure of that; but, to be frank, I think it would be very positive if we were to begin the immigration and asylum policy. Mrs Grossetête asked the Commission for more initiatives. I would ask the Commission for fewer initiatives. It has presented all the initiatives it should have presented. We have a package of proposals which make up a coherent and reasonable immigration policy. What we need to do is to begin to take decisions in this area. I believe that we should not increase the range of proposals so that the Council can just select little bits of them, but we must demonstrate political will in order to make progress in global terms.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally I would like to welcome the proposal for integration policies and, above all, the idea of coordinating these polices with social policy. If we believe that immigrants must enter Europe for employment purposes, we must be effective in both areas, we need an immigration policy which works, but also a labour market which works, a social policy which incorporates immigrants in order to respond to the local problems which immigration creates.</p>

Unfortunately, we are currently facing the terrible accident involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> off the coast of Galicia, which makes this working principle all the more evident.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commission, by means of its Vice-President, on its rapid reaction and its cooperation with the Spanish and Galician authorities in relation to this dramatic event. I would also like to acknowledge the Commissioner for Transport and the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have approved the Erika I and Erika II packages, which, had they already been applied, could perhaps have helped us to prevent an accident of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to point out that the Directive on the monitoring of traffic – yet to be transposed – in Article 20, lays down the definition of areas of refuge, which, although they are vague, would allow vessels with problems to reach them to try to resolve them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have examples such as the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which was not authorised by the French authorities to enter the port of Saint Nazaire, or now the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, not authorised to enter Galician ports, clearly due to the high ecological value of that coast. There should be further proposals for the creation of areas of refuge out to sea, sufficiently close so that vessels with problems can reach them and sufficiently far from coasts to prevent serious ecological problems, but which allow for immediate naval rescue actions with technical resources, both aerial and marine. And the measure, Madam Vice-President, if included in the Commission’s programme, could be applied urgently without the need to wait for transposition of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to repeat the question from Mrs Frassoni on PVC and what has happened to the goals regarding PVC in this work programme, for they were included in both last year’s programme and that of the previous year, but they have now disappeared. This is exceedingly disturbing, as we are talking about an incredibly hazardous substance which we know exists in large quantities in our environment. In terms of waste, no fewer than four million tonnes of PVC waste are produced every year. Perhaps Commissioner Liikanen or Commissioner Wallström should answer the question of what has happened to the Commission’s goals on the issue of PVC.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question relates to the structural funds, the common agricultural policy and EU-financed programmes and plans in general. During 2003-2004, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), will enter into force in the Member States. Unfortunately, SEA does not yet cover EU-financed plans and programmes, but the Commission has promised that this must happen, something for which Parliament has expressed its support. I now want to know whether it is the case that the Commission has started to set up an internal organisation to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to implement this type of impact assessment for EU-financed plans and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">My final question relates to Natura 2000. We are still waiting for a communication from the Commission, which has been delayed a number of times. Now it has been included in the programme, and I would therefore simply like to point out the importance of this communication actually being issued next year, preferably as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously it is the countries themselves that are responsible for national air traffic control systems, but would it not be appropriate to have a central overview of all the current and planned flights, whether they be civil or military, in order to improve utilisation of the airspace, reduce the number of delays and lessen the impact on the environment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find this extraordinary. This Parliament has repeatedly pointed out to the Commission and the Council over many years that there is an urgent need for a directive on a framework for services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">My understanding is that the spring summit instructed the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a framework for services of a general interest by the end of this year. Yet what we have in this work programme for next year is the promise of a green paper to discuss the principles on which services of general economic interest might – might – be constructed. At the same time, we have a promise on page 12 that measures to complete the internal market, by eliminating barriers to the provision and take-up of services by business and consumers, will proceed next year. I do not find this acceptable. This House and the spring summit have been ignored. All the calls this House has made for universal services of general interest to the citizens of Europe to be guaranteed as a matter of urgency have been ignored, although this is a key part of European citizenship and of the social model we are so proud of in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like a clear answer from the Commission as to why it is failing to do what this Parliament has asked it to do and what it was instructed to do by the Council at the spring summit, because this is not acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is about securing our external borders. I very much welcome the programme and proposals with regard to enlargement, and particularly the fact that you want to have uniform responsibilities. The question is this: when do you think the new Schengen manual will be available? We will have common training programmes. When do you think this common training system will be operational?</p>
<p class="contents">What I would also like to request is that we should consider the compatibility of the technology being used and that we should also get Europol to carry out the proposed risk assessment as soon as possible. When do you think the system will be operating?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is about migration. Our objective – and on this we agree – must be to create viable legal immigration mechanisms and prevent illegal immigration. However, the problem that arises here relates in particular to the area of asylum, where, although the Commission has made proposals, final decisions remain to be made in all areas. But we need decisions to be made quickly so that genuine refugees – who make up about 10% of applicants – can be helped swiftly and so that repatriation can be arranged for the remaining 90% that have to be rejected. Commissioner Vitorino, how do you intend to ensure that a system of this kind can finally be made operational and that we can secure Council approval? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I admire Mrs de Palacio for answering questions across all areas of policy, including those of her colleagues who have other priorities. What I have said amounts to praise for those of her colleagues who are actually here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs de Palacio, Commissioners, I have read the work programme very carefully. It is better than what you have usually come up with. In my areas of interest at least, it is more helpful. You have integrated the concept of sustainability throughout, as we have always requested. I really get the impression that you have done your homework, that you have understood the issues and that the external presentation at least has been very well done.</p>
<p class="contents">‘External presentation’ and ‘internal behaviour’ are, however, two very different things. My queries relate in particular to internal behaviour. Let us consider the leftovers, that is to say the things you are carrying forward from 2002. In my field, which is environmental policy, there are some areas that Mrs Schörling and Mrs Frassoni and others have touched upon, such as policy on chemical products, PVC, the batteries directive, and various others.</p>
<p class="contents">If I consider why that is, I see that one of the main problem areas is that you cannot achieve any internal agreement. You have conflicts between environmental, industrial and trade policy, and there is also often conflict between consumer protection and trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If you cannot resolve these internal conflicts, if you cannot manage to demonstrate leadership and say 'OK, the Commissioner responsible has power over the inter-service procedure', then we will always find ourselves with ‘leftovers’.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am asking you, Mrs de Palacio, how you intend to resolve conflicts within the Commission in future, and whether you are willing to air these conflicts in a more open and transparent way. We can only ever guess the reasons why no proposals are presented to us. We learn them already from the grapevine and the rumour mill. We mostly seek answers in Commissioner Liikanen's areas of responsibility, sometimes, often enough in fact, we seek them in Commissioner Lamy's areas, and sometimes in Commissioner Bolkestein's areas too. I regard them as being the naughty boys. I am not referring to poor Commissioner Wallström and Commissioner Byrne, who always do their best but are sometimes pushed to one side. I expect your internal behaviour to reflect the way you present things externally. That means that you will also present the proposals that you have presented to us very quickly in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should first like to make a request: please do not abuse the adjective ‘sustainable’. It is rather like those awful restaurants where they put cream or parsley on everything and in the end ruin every dish. ‘Sustainable economy’, Mrs de Palacio and Mrs Diamantopoulou, means absolutely nothing. It is just a nod towards the environmentalism of the Greens, towards the left with ‘solidarity’ and towards the right with ‘economics’. In short, a little semantic correctness would not go amiss.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now deal with some rather more serious matters that I have noticed. President Prodi has spoken of a single cycle of economic policy coordination – I am referring to point 2.3, b4) – and, indeed, only a single cycle is needed because the objectives laid down in the Stability Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines must coincide with those of the real economy, in other words the labour market and, above all, welfare. You realise that the labour market and welfare are two sides of the same coin. Well, while the labour market already has an implicit coordination process – the Luxembourg process – which has been making positive headway for six or seven years now, the same is not true for the more recent (as one might say) Laeken process for coordinating welfare action, which has yet to be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The two systems are unbalanced: much has been done in the area of close coordination on the labour market, while everything still remains to be done as regards welfare. My request is therefore that the two coordination processes be synchronised as fully as possible so that they then make it possible to fulfil not only Lisbon but the Stability Pact too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Can we be assured that even when the treaties are signed there will be no winding down of DG Enlargement? That will ensure that we have the staff to carry out the monitoring process, which is still important right up to accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the focus will inevitably move on to the stability of our borders, as the Commission says in its programme, but it does not say what new steps we are actually going to take. We talk about relations with Moldova, for example. Moldova is very close to being defined as a failed state. How are we actually going to deal with it and with Ukraine, with which we have still tried to have relations? In relation to Bosnia and Kosovo, are we simply going to carry on as before, or are we going to look at enhancing our work there in order to better secure our borders?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we put emphasis on the CFSP in preparing the Commission's role in that area. However, defence procurement and securing the future of European defence industries are important. To that end we have previously had action plans from the Commission on how it can use its instruments to support that process. Commissioner Liikanen keeps promising me that he will put forward a further action plan, but I see no reference to that in the annual programme. Are we going to see an action plan on future defence industries and on defence procurement, and are we going to see the Commission using the instruments it has available? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the presentation of this programme today marks the end of an interinstitutional schedule of financial payments agreed between our two institutions in January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As this is the first exercise of its kind, it will clearly be possible to improve a number of points next time and I shall take the liberty of coming back to this matter at the end of my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">In February 2002, the Commission presented to Parliament the annual political strategy for the year 2003. On the basis of this document, a true interinstitutional dialogue took place, from April to July, between the parliamentary committees and Commissioners concerned, on the scope and implementation of political priorities in each specific field of competence. In July, within the Conference of Committee chairmen, jointly with the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, we carried out an assessment of this year’s programme. Then, in September, the Conference of Committee chairmen, also in the presence of Mrs de Palacio, drew up an inventory of the various legislative proposals that the Commission intended to introduce in its legislative and work programme for next year. The document that Mr Prodi has just presented is therefore, to a great extent, the outcome of the dialogue which has taken place throughout the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in order to conclude this process, Parliament is due to decide on a motion for a resolution on 5 December. In this regard, I would inform you that the parliamentary committees decided, at the meeting which took place the day before yesterday, to prepare, each in their own field of competence, a contribution which can be included in this motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me to inform the European Commission, as well as Parliament, of my positive assessment of the interinstitutional schedule of financial payments which has been established for the first time. More or less one year ago, the Commission position, as you will all recall, was practically the opposite. The establishment of this schedule of financial payments required a great deal of effort, in particular by Parliament. In this regard, I would like to highlight the remarkable work of our colleague Mrs Malmström, during negotiations with the Commission. In fact, it was possible to establish the schedule of financial payments due to the mutual trust that has been created between our two institutions with regard to legislative programming. Naturally, on the basis of this year’s experience, the various stages will be better understood and can be implemented next year. A true culture of planning and interinstitutional programming is currently developing between the European institutions, which is surely moving in the direction expected by our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, allow me to conclude my speech by recalling that at the time of the Seville Summit of 21 and 22 July this year, the European Council decided that the Council would establish a work programme. I therefore hope that the resolution upon which Parliament is to vote on 5 December will also address the Council with a view to establishing its programme for the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by emphasising the importance of dialogue with the Council. I would like to thank Mr Haarder in particular, who has always been there when we needed him. I believe it is worth emphasising, Mr Haarder, because it is good to hear congratulations, too, from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">Efficient legislative programming effectively means two things. First of all, transparency in terms of knowledge and citizens’ access to the legislative work that the European Union intends to undertake in the year ahead. Secondly, greater efficiency in carrying out legislative work, not forgetting that, thanks to better programming, Parliament, the Council and the Commission can inform the national parliaments and the citizens on legislative work and take full responsibility for it.</p>

The first of these is the enlargement of Europe. We have already heard several times that the signals indicating the direction the Commission would like to go in here are too weak. Let us take a look at the Balkans, for example. This region in particular now feels as if it has been rather abandoned – the finance available to it has been reduced. That may be justified, but that is all the more reason to give stronger political signals offering these countries two alternatives: either the route to membership at a later stage, or some other option.</p>
<p class="contents">The Zagreb Summit is coming up. I do not know what the Council has in mind, but I would like to know, Madam Vice-President, what the Commission intends to propose at the Zagreb Summit, at Zagreb II that is, about what should happen in the Balkan region. Is it being specifically identified as an enlargement region once the first round of enlargement has been completed? Yes or no?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the issue of stability and security. The point I am about to make has already been made, but I think it could be made more forcefully. Our security is very closely linked to our viewing other, neighbouring regions, ranging from the Balkans to the Caucasus, as partner regions with which we have appropriate treaties and where we intend to extend cooperation against cross-border crime and illegal mass migration.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more positive note, let us look at energy. I think we can agree on this, Commissioner. You have brought forward a raft of energy policy proposals, including proposals on energy policy in relation to nuclear safety. We are now in a position to discuss the details and I am sure that we will not always agree. I believe, however, that it is high time we regarded a coherent energy policy strategy as being part of our external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What regions do we want to link more closely with Europe, especially as regards energy security policy? Let us consider the Caucasian region – or are we leaving it up to the Americans to act there? The Balkans are also involved in terms of the various pipelines that need to be developed and secured there. This combination of external policy strategy with security policy strategy and even including energy security needs to be made far stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the issue of a sustainable and inclusive economy. Here I think that what is lacking is a statement about economic policy cooperation, particularly with the European Central Bank. The way this cooperation has been implemented in practice so far is by no means satisfactory. I do recognise, however, that Mr Prodi's observations about increased flexibility in relation to the stability pact are not reflected in the work programme, not directly at least. In which case I do not know why he highlighted that point, but so be it. However, the issue of how we can cooperate with the Central Bank to assume greater responsibility in terms of economic policy, and therefore also employment policy, needs to be given greater emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">On page 14 there is a paragraph about services of general interest. I am amazed that the Commission should be saying again that we need to initiate a debate on this. A much-needed debate is already taking place, although unfortunately not one in which the Commission has played any really significant role. Mr Prodi's comments on this need to be taken really seriously if we are to make progress in this area, because services of general interest are an important issue not just in France but also in many of our Member States, and we need to have a clear line on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make some general points about the legislative proposals. Madam Vice-President, you know that you are our partner in the debate on alternative forms of regulation. We in this House have a very great interest in seeing laws adopted more quickly and in applying the legislative process in a more flexible way, but to do that we need the cooperation of the Commission and the Council. I will say something about that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is willing to help on a great many issues. It is perhaps a little too fearful that we want to take away its right of initiative. We do not want to do that, nor are we able to. Even if we did want to, we could not take it away from you. But that does not mean you are entering into a more productive dialogue with us. And it does not mean, above all in areas where we have delegated our legislative competence, that we have a right of call-back, because we are after all surrendering some of our competence and so we want something in return.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that I find totally incomprehensible. I am sorry to say that and have only praise for you, Mr Haarder, for sitting here for hours and listening; I really admire that. I have in mind the very disappointing opinion adopted by the Council, by Coreper, on the issue of other forms of legislation. It is not often you see something so restrictive and backward looking. You really cannot expect Parliament to surrender legislative competence as long as you are not willing to budge an inch yourselves! You talked about comitology as if it were the holy of holies, as if it were our primary objective! That really is not acceptable. We need to have a situation in which Parliament and the Council are to some extent treated as equals. We do not want to impinge on your rights, but please respect ours!</p>

We must ensure the good functioning of the Union for our citizens present and future. That applies very much to the process of how we legislate, how we implement legislation and how we enforce legislation. The debate has been very wide-ranging debate as regards how we legislate in this process. However, I could not help thinking while listening to the many detailed questions that we have heard that perhaps more of what I and my colleagues have been dealing with could have been dealt with at an earlier stage in the Committees, to give us a more strategic debate here today.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I welcome the emphasis on impact assessments and the emphasis on involvement of our citizens and transparency. That has to be the right way forward. I would raise some concerns about the Commission's powers of enforcement in terms of infringement proceedings as we move towards enlargement. We must make sure that sufficient resources and measures are available in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the Court. The Court has to be fully resourced in order to carry out its tasks in the difficult times that lie ahead. We have had a good debate, a good exchange, but I still am left wondering whether it has truly been the strategic debate that should have engaged all of this House and our citizens outside. We have done well but we could still do a lot better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who could oppose the objectives of succeeding in enlargement, ensuring stability and security, firmly supporting the relaunch of the economy and employment, controlling globalisation and ensuring that the resulting benefits are redistributed as widely as possible taking account of Kyoto, Monterrey and Johannesburg, not forgetting a knowledge-based society, developing research with increased appropriations and better interaction between science and society. I must, however, admit to you my concern over the deepening abyss between the stated objectives, on the one hand, and the means implemented in order to achieve them and therefore the results that will arise from them, on the other. Moreover, in European public opinion polls, this is often what destroys the European ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we succeed in enlargement without taking account of the diversity of the candidate countries – thereby better recognising the diversity of the current Member States – without taking sufficient account of their difficulties and needs, while at the same time we require them to succeed immediately in doing what some of the Fifteen have still not managed to do? How can we ensure security and also combat crime while limiting ourselves to a ‘Great Wall of China’ or ‘Berlin Wall’ type strategy, in other words substantially communitarising the acceptance and immigration rules in a realistic but humane way throughout the Union? How can we boost employment when free competition and the free market are detrimental to public services as a whole and when jobs are still considered a variable to be adjusted to benefit companies and when we attach more importance to financial, accounting and monetary concerns rather than to the economy and employment? How, lastly, can we control globalisation when the USA dominates the world in political and military terms and when large industrial and financial groups take care of the rest – often, moreover – under the control of the USA and large world stock exchanges? I do not know what the future holds for the Johannesburg conclusions, but I am fully aware of the way in which some have treated the Kyoto conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I shall ask the question that I would have liked to ask when research was mentioned: the Council has imposed a moratorium on stem cells. What will happen at the end of 2003 if the Council does not manage to reach an agreement on the ethical issues relating to these hundreds of millions of euros in appropriations?</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, I share the Commission’s objectives. I cannot believe, however, that they will be achieved more successfully in 2003 than in 2002 or 2001, unless the necessary financial and political means are provided. The good qualities of the Commission and the Commissioners are not in question – the problem runs deeper than that. It is the whole problem of the European and world framework, the place of social issues, human issues and citizens. There is, in fact, a certain amount of discord among us on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to say that although I am happy with it, I would have preferred a more strategic debate. I, like Mrs Wallis, think that we have to set priorities and that Europe has to decide on its place and its role in the world and in the future of the world. This is really the main priority for me and for us. We must start by adapting our own institutions and asking ourselves whether our own house is in order. I would again ask for attention to be given to the place of the regions, this is becoming an important issue. So many small states will be joining the European Union, with all that entails, including their own language, their own place in the Council, in Parliament and in the Commission. The constitutional regions, the other regions too, the regions with their own language, their own culture, even with legislative and their own implementing authorities, will continue to be deprived of all this and be left behind empty-handed. I would ask whether they will then have to become a state to gain a respectable place in the European Union? That is an incitement to separatism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want the full integration of the countries that are going to become the European Union with us. Should we then, however, not do more so that the populations of these countries actually become involved? I hear the complaint for example that very many people are unable to find European Union documents available in their own language. However, I want to focus more attention, because that was yesterday’s debate, on the circles of partner countries that we have to develop. I think that this debate about the expansion of this second circle is of fundamental importance if we wish to conduct the debate about the boundaries of the Union in a positive manner. Personally I do not believe that Europe should extend to the borders of Iraq, Iran and Syria, but we do have to be able to offer Turkey an attractive partnership. At the moment this is something we are really talking too little about.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is our role in the world. Peace and development currently involve more than simply the follow-up to Johannesburg. As long as Europe is more part of the problem of poverty than part of the solution, then, Mr Nielsen, we have to place a big question mark by all the good things we undoubtedly do. Because we know that as long as we engage in agriculture, as long as we engage in trade as we currently do, we are more part of the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is to be established in accordance with what has been called the ‘all-purpose article’: the famous Article 235, now Article 308, which is unchanged in the Treaty of Nice. This shows that there is no limit to the EU’s interference in the affairs of the Member States. With so many new countries due to join the EU next year, it would be better for us all to focus on consolidation and simplification of the existing legislation rather than continuing to build the Brussels legislative pyramid higher and higher. This could be done as follows: the Commission should only be permitted to put forward new proposals on condition that the corresponding old legislation is deleted in the process. All new proposals should be presented in their legal context, so that it is possible to compare proposals for new legislation with the existing legislation. No new proposals should be presented unless they are accompanied by proposals regarding the means of consolidation of the existing legislation in the field. This approach would make it possible to reduce the acquis communautaire from more than 85 000 pages to perhaps 25 000 pages.</p>
<p class="contents">Having accomplished this, we should strive to simplify binding legislation, transforming it into non-binding recommendations; regulations can be transformed into framework legislation, total harmonisation directives into minimum harmonisation directives, and uniform rules into voluntary rules. Attempts to create a federal state with an ever increasing amount of legislation could be replaced with a decentralised confederation of states, which would allow the Member States a great deal more freedom. This is our vision of the form the Commission’s legislative programme should take. We want a Europe of democracies based on diversity, as we believe that people will be happier if they can determine their own affairs as far as possible without interference and free from detailed rules drawn up by bureaucrats and lobbyists in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gollnisch (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like every year, reading the Commission’s legislative programme for 2003 is enough to make your head spin, first of all because it measures the scope of the areas of intervention in the European Union. It shows that, from reviews to reforms of the Treaties, the Member States have given up their most legitimate prerogatives to become nothing more than local municipalities of the future European super-State. The theoretical introduction of the principle of subsidiarity that you claim to want finally to take into account after ten years by no means curbs the Union’s legislative appetite. As far as the rest is concerned, we can but approve of the legitimate objectives, such as the stated desire to study the impact of Community legislation or codify existing legislation. We could even ask why this did not happen earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also shows the underlying commitment to prepare the European Union for enlargement, and not only from the institutional point of view. Beyond agricultural and financial decisions which are far from being finalised, many allegedly technical adjustments remain to be made, as well as a general review of many policies which will only take place on conclusion of the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the objective of participating in the Middle East peace process, how can we fail to have doubts when we learn that the day before yesterday, Great Britain participated unilaterally, together with the United States of America, in an air strike – yet another – against Iraq, the very day on which the inspectors stipulated in Resolution 1441 arrived there? I gladly admit that the Commission is not responsible for this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the document as a whole leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. The 2003 programme reveals the importance of the international servitude of the European Union, in addition to the desire to open up the Union as a whole to immigration, which is described as a source of cultural riches and economic strength, which unfortunately is in no way confirmed by the facts. Europe has no reason to exist if its union does not strengthen its members. The Europe we are now building on a constitutional and legislative level sadly does not contribute to this in any way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would firstly like to say that we are pleased to be able to hold this debate, which has been preceded by work by all the Commissioners in the committees, and which, in the end, has led to a result which we can regard as positive. In this respect, I would like to thank you, on behalf of all the Commissioners, for the input provided systematically in the debates and discussions which have taken place in the various committees in order to fine-tune our programme. When we presented our first proposals, we received initial reactions from Parliament’s relevant committees. I am therefore grateful for the work carried out. This has been an initial test whose result has not been homogenous in all the committees. I hope that next year it will work perfectly in all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to enlargement, I believe that President Prodi has been very clear. There is no question that 2003 is still the main priority. We must pursue the negotiations with the countries which are going to enter in the second wave and ensure that all the changes and adaptations which the candidates entering in 2004 have committed themselves to are being implemented and carried out. This clearly requires considerable effort on the part of the candidate countries, and also of the Commission, in terms of cooperating with them in order to facilitate this work and rigorously verify that it is carried out. If it is not, mechanisms will have to be implemented in order to correct the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">After enlargement and with the perspectives we have, what will happen? The President has clearly pointed out that we will have to decide on issues relating to the countries of the former Yugoslavia and also that circle of countries with which we have special relations. I believe that that will be the challenge we will have to discuss, develop and monitor. But at the moment the priority – let us make this very clear – is what we have on the table: the 2004 countries and those countries, in principle, Bulgaria and Rumania, which should enter in 2007. With regard to Turkey, we are in a situation of stand-by, of waiting, simply because Turkey is yet to fulfil the political requirements for entry into the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic field, I will say that the Commission – this is the third priority, as the President has pointed out – will continue to implement the structural modifications necessary to promote the Lisbon project. The European Union, as the most developed knowledge-based economy, which aims for full employment, will in 2010 be the most competitive society. That is how we are going to continue to work, and, in this respect, I would point out that, with regard to the Stability Pact, we have the framework of the Treaties, which are very clear, including the Protocol, in which figures are clearly mentioned – such as the 3% of deficit and 60% of debt – and it is true that at the Barcelona Council we have been asked to work to create greater economic coordination – which was mentioned earlier, by Mr Barón for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner responsible, Mr Solbes, has given us an initial presentation with regard to the approach and the timetable, and soon the relevant specific documents will be presented.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other aspects, I will only make a couple of brief comments on issues falling within my own competence. There has been mention of the problems of legislation and the problem of commitology, ladies and gentlemen. We know that, at the moment, by means of the high-level group of interinstitutional cooperation, we are negotiating certain agreements with the Council. On this particular problem we do not have a real agreement and we are trying to find some common ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in any event, there has also been progress in this field and that the progress has been made during this last year. We must continue along this road. I believe that the possibilities for improvement are favourable. In this regard, I would like to say that the Commission will continue to work with Parliament and also, of course, with the Council. In this way we will manage to find a conclusion on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to resources and ambitions, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, despite everything, the results of the development and process of European Union construction clearly indicate that our ambitions are great, but that we are achieving them. Of course, the Commission can always ask for more human resources and has done so, specifically in view of enlargement. An agreement has been reached on the minimum necessary. I can only say that we would have liked even more. If anyone insists on this area, I believe we are working with minimum resources, but that we are achieving a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by commenting on the specific issues that fall within my competence. There has been mention of the Single Sky and responsibility for Eurocontrol. Ladies and gentlemen, the Single Sky does not mean that flight plans are going to be decided by the Commission. Flight plans are still coordinated within Europe by Eurocontrol, not only for the Fifteen, but for all the members of Eurocontrol, of which there are now more than thirty. They are different things; the Single Sky involves another series of areas which mean the harmonisation of management rules within the European Union and compatibility of inter-operative systems, management systems, integrating them into a network. Specific execution is still in the hands of the States and global coordination in the hands of Eurocontrol.</p>
<p class="contents">In the other area, in Mr Ripoll’s area, I would like to say that what this <span class="italic">Prestige </span>tragedy – which we all regret, especially the Commission – demonstrates is that we were right. We were right to demand greater speed in the approval of measures and in the application of the measures proposed. Unfortunately, the Council, Parliament and the final agreements did not achieve much; there were more difficulties than we expected and they have been delayed. And since they have been delayed, regrettably, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident has taken place. Let us hope that the early implementation of the 'Erika I' package – I have asked the Ministers for it to enter into force before next June – and of the 'Erika II' package, in February 2004, will prevent any further accident such as that suffered by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> or by the <span class="italic">Erika </span>three years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to areas of refuge, amongst the proposals in the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' packages, there are some which call for the different countries to determine and stipulate appropriate ports for dealing with emergency situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Galicia is part of 'Natura 2002'. When talking about certain things, we must bear in mind all the available information, not to mention the difficulties for some ports on that coast, which I know very well and better than certain others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would ask that Mrs Diamantopoulou, Mr Nielson and Mr Vitorino may speak next, since many issues have been addressed to them.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL)</span> I would like to comment on four sets of issues which relate to my portfolio. First, the legislative programme. Legislative proposals for 2003 are based on the Community agenda decided at the Nice summit. Other legislative proposals were made during detailed and constructive discussions with the committee in question but are not on the Community agenda. By working together, we found a way of carrying four of the proposals mentioned over to 2003, namely protection for female workers and for pregnant and nursing workers, reform of parental leave and atypical forms of work. We shall be monitoring progress on all these legislative proposals together with Parliament outside the framework of the Community agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">First, reform of the Community agenda and the role of parliament. It was decided in Nice that 2003 would be the year for social reform. Parliament will have a very specific role here. In January, we shall be presenting the scoreboard for the Community agenda so far which, I may add, shows that there are no delays. We shall be working with Parliament and the other Community institutions to see what additional proposals need to be included on the Community agenda in March 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, sexual equality. We have clear commitments and priorities for 2003. First, all the legislation from the past twenty years is to be codified. Secondly, we have a specific legislative proposal based on Article 13. There has been a delay here, which we have discussed repeatedly with the Committee on Women's Rights, and we are counting on their help for the final presentation. We have horizontal commitments, both quantitative and qualitative, on the question of gender equality, specific targets in a whole series of policies, and we shall be presenting a report evaluating mainstreaming in policies in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Employment Strategy. First, we obviously cannot force national parliaments to implement national action plans on employment. The Commission's recommendations point out that the cooperation required between governments, parliaments and the social partners in order to present national action plans on employment is lacking in almost every Member State. There are two ways forward here. One is to present and use best practices – and here the national parliaments really are playing an essential role in some countries – to bring about progress in other countries, and the other is to use the discussions taking place in the Convention to see what part national parliaments can play.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Employment Strategy, we shall start coordinating this strategy with the economic guidelines in 2003. This is a very important move; it will make the European Parliament's role more effective and clarify how the economic guidelines and the Employment Strategy interact, and it is accompanied by timetables that allow for serious dialogue. As far as sustainable development and employment policies are concerned, I think that what we need in the social sector, in strictly political terms, is to ensure that social repercussions are assessed in every economic and environmental decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, social insurance. There were important developments here in 2002. For the first time, agreement has been reached at European level on a political framework for pension reforms. Until now, pensions have been dealt with under financial policy. We now have a framework based on three principles: viable pensions, adequate pensions and the facility to adjust pension systems. In other words, we have a more holistic approach. This is the first time the open method of cooperation has been applied to pension system reforms and we shall be presenting the first report on pension systems using this holistic approach in a few days' time. Of course, the question of social insurance is far more complex. Progress has been made on the matter of public health systems with reference to workers and a Commission communication will be submitted, again in 2003, and I should also mention the very important role of the new Committee on Social Insurance and its cooperation with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, in addition to the answers already given by President Prodi, I would like to call the attention of the House to the fact that as far as return policy is concerned, very intensive work is under way on the programme for return to Afghanistan, thanks to the commitment of the Danish Presidency. In 2003 the Commission will present a directive on minimum rules on return policy, above all in order to guarantee the mutual recognition of return decisions taken by a Member State. Such decisions should be automatically recognised and executed by the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recently presented a proposal for a European return programme. That is already under discussion in the Council's specialised working groups.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to integration policy, we have put forward a proposal to create some pilot projects between 2003 and 2005 in order to promote the exchange of best practices as far as integration policy is concerned. However, it has to be recognised that there is no explicit legal basis in the Treaty for dealing with integration policy at European level. Therefore we need to discuss the added value of addressing integration policy in European-wide terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as far as immigration and asylum is concerned, I can reiterate that the Commission has put forward all the proposals asked of it by the Tampere European Council and the Laeken Council. The time has now come for the Council to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">The only two new elements of asylum policy that we are taking into consideration are two proposals that are included in our programme for 2003. The first one concerns resettlement policy and the second protection in the region – the possibility of asking for asylum outside the territory of the European Union. These two proposals will follow very closely the consultations launched by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, concerning the Seville Conclusions, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has already presented to the Council the proposal on mandates for new readmission agreements with the People's Republic of China, Albania, Algeria and Turkey. In June 2003 we are supposed to present, as set out in our programme, the report on burden sharing on external border control. We are now preparing a report on the financial allocations for partnerships with third countries aimed at tackling illegal immigration. The report aims to identify effective allocations of financial tools, possible shortcomings and the vulnerabilities that must be overcome in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to external borders, I can confirm that the Commission intends to present a reform of the common manual on external borders in March 2003. All the other actions asked of us in Seville, such as joint training and joint operation in the control of external borders, are already being developed by the appropriate Council working group and will be financed by the Commission's ARGO programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we recognise the fight against terrorism as a priority for 2003. As far as legislative action is concerned, priority should be given to the fight against sources of financing for terrorism, and several of the proposals included in our programme address this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said, we intend to bring forward proposals concerning common procedural guarantees in criminal procedures. We have launched a consultation and intend to build upon the results of that consultation in a green paper. We shall therefore be bringing forward a proposal on common minimum rules on criminal procedure guarantees in the 15 Member States by the end of next year.</p>

To Mrs Frassoni, who talked about the outcome of the Johannesburg Summit, I will start by saying that the Commission in many ways shares the worries about the softness of some of the decisions taken there but this has been duly commented on.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of the relationship between international agreements on the environment and the WTO framework, in Johannesburg it was a non-event and nothing new happened: nothing was added to WTO, nothing was subtracted. Johannesburg was an attempt for the two sides to see if that balance could be changed – and it was not changed. For that reason not everyone was happy, but there is a limit to the unhappiness.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question from Mrs Frassoni concerned the category II initiatives which are too weak and unclear. I agree that the risk is that these weak initiatives do not add up to anything substantial. The hard core of follow-up actions for the European Union to Johannesburg will be our water and energy initiatives. These are not going to be weak or unclear. They are already on the agenda for the spring European Council and we are already engaged with the Member States in clarifying these initiatives, which we see as big and important.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr van den Burg that we need more rapid disbursement, especially regarding activities covered by the EDF. Things are moving forward and are somewhat better than they used to be, but we still have unsolved problems concerning staff and structure. This is an ongoing battle.</p>
<p class="contents">We are preparing to do bigger things in the HIPIC global health fund, education for all. All this depends on starting up the 9th EDF and I would urge Mr van den Burg when he returns to the Netherlands to make sure that the last remaining country in the convoy takes the necessary action, so that we are ready to access 9th EDF money.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the agricultural profile of Europe in these global negotiations, this is back on track. We managed in Johannesburg and we are still managing to keep alive the formulations embedded in the Doha language on this front. We still see the external actions there as part of the necessary process of adaptation, which we in Europe have to take seriously. This language is continually being confirmed at all the meetings. Yesterday in the General Affairs and External Relations Council this was again the case. We are on track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then Mr Patten's service and mine have continued to work on this. We shall be having a further Relex Commissioners' meeting in December with the aim of defining a Commission vision of an optimum armaments policy for the European Union, ensuring that its defence-related industry is competitive and in a position to underpin the capabilities required for the ESDP. I hope that the next time this issue comes up for discussion we shall be able to present specific documents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know this because I was sitting over there as a Member of Parliament last year when the Commission presented its legislative programme, and at that time the way of working was completely different. Moreover, there was criticism from Parliament that we have heard nothing of today. This is a testament to the great progress that has been made in the dialogue between the Council and Parliament, and I am happy to be present on this occasion, too, and to contribute to the dialogue for a couple of minutes, without delaying the start of the voting at 12 noon sharp.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is very pleased with the Commission’s proposals. We have noted the priorities set by the legislative and work programme, and I can say on behalf of the Council that we support the Commission’s intention to apply impact assessments to the chief legislative initiatives. This is something that Mr Clegg mentioned, and I believe Mrs Frassoni also talked about. In this connection, I wish to say to both Mrs Frassoni and Mr Swoboda that I too should have liked more progress to be made on the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking. We had an excellent meeting in Brussels on 1 October, which I believe both Mrs Frassoni and Mr Swoboda attended, and I sensed that we were very close to reaching tangible agreement on a number of points. Now, of course, time is running out, and so if we are to achieve a result by the end of the year, I would suggest that we now set ourselves some realistic goals, that we set out the points we can agree on and that we also show a degree of flexibility. The Council can make concessions on some points, for example these alternative or weak forms of regulation that Mrs Frassoni spoke about. I believe that we can reach agreement on that. Then there are other matters which are more difficult, for example comitology, where it is well known that different countries have different traditions; but let us now reach agreement on as much as possible. I am prepared to continue the dialogue, which has unfortunately been extended and interrupted. Let us resume this dialogue, and let us ask our government officials to give us a basis for discussion in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the Greek and Italian Presidencies, therefore, to draw up a joint work programme for the Council for the coming year. The new work programme will be presented to the Council in December: probably on 9–10 December. I understand that the vote on the Commission’s programme here in Parliament is taking place as early as 5 December. I am convinced that the upcoming Presidencies will pay due regard not only to the Commission work programme but also to the views on the work programme that Parliament has expressed and is going to express in the days ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to thank Mr Vitorino for his words on asylum and immigration. As I happen to be President of the Council which deals with such matters, I should like to confirm everything Mr Vitorino said. We aim to complete new sets of rules on the reception of asylum seekers, the definition of a refugee and also the question as to which state is responsible for examining an asylum application.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mr Titley, who called for a policy towards our new neighbours after enlargement, that, the day before yesterday, the General Affairs Council in Brussels worked out a more long-term strategy, to be implemented in cooperation with the candidate countries; a strategy that shall ensure that these new borders towards the east are cooperative borders rather than another Iron Curtain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to address Mr Barón Crespo, who raised the question as to what the situation will be as regards the Commission, which will include Commissioners from the new Member States, and how the transition will take place. As I announced yesterday, the General Affairs Council recommended the day before yesterday at its meeting in Brussels that accession take place on 1 May, and that the brand new Commission, including Commissioners from the new Member States, take office on 1 November, so that the new Parliament has enough time to approve the new Commissioners. In this way, in the intervening period, from 1 May to 1 November, there will be Commissioners from the new Member States who do not have a portfolio, and who therefore do not need to be approved by Parliament. But this is all just a recommendation. I mentioned it yesterday because it is of course only possible with the cooperation of Parliament, and it is in the spirit of this good working relationship that I mentioned the Council’s thoughts. We are completely open to Parliament’s thoughts on the subject.</p>
