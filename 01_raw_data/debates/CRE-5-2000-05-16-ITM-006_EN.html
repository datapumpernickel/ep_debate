<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, our discussion today on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, transmissible diseases which include BSE or scrapie, is one of the many follow-up reports or one of the follow-up discussions to the final BSE report and I think that it is also of great interest to the visitors in the gallery. We have a report here before us which the Commission promised together with its final report on the 1997 BSE report at Parliament’s request. It has now presented it. We have drafted a report on it, although not as quickly as we would otherwise have done, due to the break last year. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Böge have drafted opinions on it. In other words, we have been able to keep the BSE team going well.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to tell you briefly how I, as rapporteur for the committee responsible, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, assess the proposal. The Commission’s proposal is a good one; like so much of what the Commission has presented on BSE and follow-up problems and has satisfied us in previous years, we are also satisfied with this proposal but, like most things, it still has room for improvement, Mr Byrne. I said that your proposal on BSE testing had room for improvement and I say so again here today. The involvement of the European Parliament certainly needs to be improved. We must ensure that the European Parliament can act in the codecision procedure as the real guarantor of consumer and health protection in the European Union. Only then will we have a high standard and only then will you be able to work in proper collaboration with us, because the Council of Ministers, the individual Agricultural Ministers have not exactly been at the vanguard of the movement over recent years, as we here in the House are only too aware.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, and here too another proposal needs improvement, for us to hold further discussions on the rapid BSE tests. You tabled a proposal after this TSE proposal which you then needed to adjust, but the proposal is still inadequate. If we are to be able to make a real appraisal of the BSE situation in the Member States, we must make it clear that fallen stock are also to be tested for human health safety in a screening process. So far you have presented no proposal on this.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also need, and we have tried to achieve this in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is to strengthen the Member States’ obligation to inform the Commission and to give the Commission information and data on incidents in their countries, on BSE problems or on suspicious circumstances. Here too we need to take the Member States to task more. Here, too, I repeat: mistrust is always shown of the Member States, including my own, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Böge rightly pointed out – as I am sure he will again in his presentation – that we need a Community definition of geographical areas. The definition here is clearly inadequate and the Commission must explain – and I call on you to do so Mr Byrne – how it intends to deal with derogations for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other medicinal products. I am convinced of the need for the Commission to make proposals in order to close any loopholes in current legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a few comments on the proposed amendments and then, thanks to the speaking time for my group, I shall still have time for a comment at the end of the debate. I agree with nearly all the proposed amendments, but there are some and here I would ask how you evaluate them, Mr Byrne. This applies in particular to proposed Amendment No 50, which includes cat food in the proposal tabled by Mr Böge, who I know takes a very careful approach to everything. But you have said that you have a problem with cat food. Please say something about the risk of infection from cats.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Attwooll and others have proposed a number of amendments, specifically Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55. These proposed amendments limit the present proposal and do not represent any improvement, not even for the situation in the United Kingdom, which I would have understood. For example, no distinction is made between breeding and fattening; that is a completely inadequate proposal. I sympathise with the suggestion in the second part of proposed Amendment No 56 that certain materials should be removed if a Member State has a specific and efficient system, but I must also say unequivocally that, at the present stage of the discussion on special risk materials, it is a dangerous signal to Member States such as my own, which are very reticent.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to repeat quite clearly: the repercussions on the Member States have obviously been overestimated by some members in the House. In countries which have a good, operational system and a high level of protection, this regulation will not cause any deterioration. But in countries which do not, it would at long last force them to buckle down and give priority to safety and health protection. That is why I fail to understand much of the mistrust of many members, but perhaps we can clear that up in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall have another three minutes at the end of the debate, which I shall use to comment on some of the interventions by the honourable Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like expressly to praise the excellent collaboration between the committees and the rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">We pointed out on a previous occasion that it is strange that there are still no common provisions for fighting scrapie, despite the fact that scrapie and BSE have somehow been linked since the beginning. We think it is important to seek a differentiated approach to preventive consumer protection by achieving an understanding of the facts and without panicking. In addition to what the rapporteur has said, we felt it was important that the Commission had incorporated the principle of regionalising the fight against TSE in order to reconcile strict measures and a sense of proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that we feel it is important, in the case of the livestock affected, to have a proper discussion on how data on age can be adapted for the purpose of measures to fight TSE. I would also add that, when we talk of the possibility of introducing tests, for example in the event of dispute between the Commission and Member States or in the event of dispute between the Commission and third countries, carrying out tests can also help to decide if a country belongs in risk category I, II or III if, for example, certain statistics cannot be organised differently.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I will not conceal the fact, Commissioner, that the problem of third countries in general will continue to remain an issue for us, as will the question of including pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. We also expect the Commission to quickly submit legal provisions on animal waste, on meat meal, so that we can define safety keys, thereby ensuring that there is a future for a responsible recycling system and guaranteeing preventive consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue will continue to remain on the agenda and that is the difference between some Member States and the majority of Member States in their approach to the question of what is more important: to define risk materials or to remove entire stocks from the food chain in the event of one case of BSE. Even scientists have so far avoided committing themselves on this point.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is essentially the basis on which this proposal for a regulation has been drawn up and we really must use this opportunity to make a concerted effort to prevent, control and eradicate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. </p>
<p class="contents">We have been well aware of this problem for many years now. Unfortunately, however, we have still not managed to eradicate the disease, nor have we managed to identify all the causes for it, hence all the concerns, restrictions and irregularities in the production and marketing of products of animal origin. It is therefore essential that action be taken throughout the Community so that firstly: we can effectively guarantee public health protection and, secondly, we can restore consumer confidence which, in turn, will help the internal market to develop and operate properly. One of the important measures recommended in the regulation is the establishment of rapid diagnosis tests, because rapid detection is one of the keys to combating this disease. Consequently, these tests, which produce results within a relatively short period of time, will most certainly help us to take immediate and appropriate action. </p>
<p class="contents">Three tests have already been proposed, although we predict that we shall see future improvements in this area, together with rapid diagnosis tests on live animals, so that we can monitor better how the whole epidemiological picture of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is developing in the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">A second key measure is to establish an ongoing epidemiological study based partly on laboratory tests using an established protocol. The introduction of uniform procedures and truly comparable results from analyses by national and Community reference laboratories will help us to monitor the situation closely and to create reliable scientific data and methods of diagnosis which include rapid diagnostic tests. It would be a good idea if, at the same time, we monitored scientific progress on the new variant disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which, as we all know, attacks humans and is caused by food from animals contaminated with BSE. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the slightest suspicion of any form of spongiform encephalopathy in any animal must be notified to the competent authorities so that we can take appropriate action. I should like to stress at this point, that in my view, we will in fact only eradicate the disease effectively if we destroy the whole herd, regardless of how much this would cost both in economic and sentimental terms. That is why the compensation paid by the Commission to beneficiaries must be quite substantial. Of course, it is hard when just one animal out of a whole herd is sick, as it is very difficult to discern if there are animals which appear healthy but which may fall ill later on. That is precisely why we are proposing this measure. “Prevention is better than cure”, as Hippocrates said all those years ago, thereby paving the way for preventive medicine. This is particularly true today, given that there is no cure either for BSE or for the equivalent human disease, the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I should like to commend and thank both Mr Böge, the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment. Thanks to their cooperation and with the help of all their other colleagues, I feel this is truly a much better regulation, and is a vast improvement on what the Commission originally presented to Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Safety must be a priority and we all understand that if we are to have equal precautions throughout the Member States, we need a variety of measures in place which have not so far been instituted.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne is to be congratulated on moving that closer. These proposals take us a good deal further down the line in the field of diagnostic testing, in a more sceptical attitude to animals which ought to have been under suspicion but in some Member States were not, and in terms of the general prospect of fallen stock being tested for the possibility of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say something, however, coming from the Member State which first suffered the full rigours of BSE and which has also, as a result of that, been in the vanguard of cleaning up this problem. We have now had for a considerable period of time in the United Kingdom an over-30-month cull of all animals which have been taken out of the food chain. We have been able to tackle the problem of the possibility of maternal transmission by also taking out those animals that might be at risk because of their ancestry. From our position, given the measures we take, we do not see any reason at all why we would need to introduce, additionally, whole-herd slaughter of the kind done in some other countries. We are being asked not just for a belt-and-braces policy but also to buy a new pair of trousers just in case. This would cost a great deal of money. It would not remove a single additional suspect case of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind those present that, with our additional safety measures, we in the UK are only exporting to the Community de-boned carcasses which have gone through maximum checks and security.</p>
<p class="contents">In the circumstances, therefore, there are a number of amendments tabled by a variety of Members in the United Kingdom which I would commend in this debate. I should be very glad to hear whether the Commissioner feels he can accept that in some circumstances – particularly in view of the over-30-month cull in the United Kingdom – for those countries which are admittedly very high risk but also with a very high level of precaution now in place a certain number of derogations are necessary and would be satisfactory to him. I sincerely hope so.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I want to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on a very good piece of work. I also want to thank Mr Böge. I wish to support in principle all the amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. </p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays, we know a very great deal indeed about the living world. Life is not, however, complete, as it were, but is evolving all the time. It is evolving not only in a positive way, but also in a negative way. As time goes on, we are faced with new viruses and new problems. The BSE crisis is an example of such a phenomenon. There are, however, also many more examples. </p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore two things which must be done. The first is the matter with which we are occupied at present, namely trying to ensure that we get the better both of BSE and of TSE, which is, of course, a broader concept. We must make sure that the situation does not occur again. However, we must also find ways of overcoming similar tragedies in the future. Such tragedies will clearly not occur in precisely this area but will crop up elsewhere. This illustrates what the present debate teaches us: that we must have comprehensive regulations for the whole of the common market constituted by the EU. We must have the same rules, monitored in the same way. Everyone must be treated the same. </p>
<p class="contents">Understandable differences in attitudes have emerged in the course of the debates which we have conducted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the party groups and which are also being conducted here and now in this Chamber. I am thinking of the last intervention. The United Kingdom has been affected badly. I can well understand why people there have points of view as to how it might perhaps be possible to make savings. Allow me, however, to say something which is extremely important. We must never suffer for having looked to short-term economic gains at the risk of long-term security. There is a danger of the short-term economy’s taking over at the expense of reason and caution. </p>
<p class="contents">To my party colleague, Mrs Attwooll, I have to say that I understand the current amendments very well but that I cannot support them. That would mean our becoming unclear and sending out false signals. I believe it is extremely important that when, in this context, we decide about this report, we send out a crystal clear signal about the firmness of our judgement on the issue of food safety. This is important prior to the forthcoming debate on the whole project entailed in the white paper which has been announced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to expressly congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report. My group has not tabled any amendments and is in full agreement with you. We give you our full support and have every confidence in you.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the proposal follows on from a pledge which was made previously regarding the follow-up committee. This is therefore to be welcomed. I would like to home in on the following issues. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it makes sense to include regionalisation and regional differentiation in the goal-oriented fight against TSE. If you are in any doubt about this, just ask my Scottish and Welsh colleagues. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are tests for a rapid diagnosis and to identify TSE in cattle. We, as Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection want to make these methods available so as to improve our monitoring procedures, and rightly so. As it happens, we all know that these tests are not yet scientifically accurate and that when these tests are applied, we do not know precisely whether infection actually occurs at each stage of the disease. I believe that these tests are at least heading in the right direction and that we should support the scientific research carried out in this field. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I welcome the requirement to destroy or remove the entire herd on farms where the disease has broken out. </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there is indeed a need for additional legislation for products such as cosmetics, medicines and pharmaceutical preparations which are excluded from the present proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a number of amendments which actually provide for a number of points to be lifted from the appendix and included in the body of the text. I think that it is important to bring about more democracy, to get away from comitology, and to increase parliamentary control. These are cardinal amendments, to my mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why this proposal needs to be changed, particularly where it specifies classifying countries into categories. </p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission really wanted to protect public health from spongiform encephalopathies, it would have proposed rules to prevent such risks a long time ago, but it did not. It would have made provision for the necessary procedures and penalties. But the interests of multinational food corporations, which have subjugated everything to the rationale of excessive profit, precluded any such action. So, this Commission initiative only made its appearance once the situation had got out of control – with dioxin for example – and is now endeavouring to show that it has some control over the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion which we draw from this draft regulation is that it is probably an attempt to cover up the situation. That is the direction in which things are heading with the classification of countries, which, rather than taking into account the most basic factor, which is the existence or non-existence of cases of encephalopathy in their raised cattle, takes account of other factors when allocating countries to a particular category. The worst thing about this is that, theoretically, if a member state in which cases of encephalopathy have been reported can prove that it has established systems for monitoring production, it could be placed in the same category as a country in which no cases have ever been reported. </p>
<p class="contents">This same spirit, this “lowest common denominator” approach, pervades the rest of the proposed measures, such as the mandatory removal of various organs (spleen, brain, spinal cord, etc.). Such measures will blacken the reputation of meat-producing countries in which there have been no cases of encephalopathy and will also discredit sheepmeat and goatmeat, since there is no substantial scientific evidence as to whether this meat is sensitive to spongiform encephalopathy pathogens. At the same time, the proposal to remove the aforementioned organs and tissues is a recipe for disaster for sheep- and goatmeat, which will be impossible to market; in other words, this measure will indirectly oust sheep and goat meat from the market, demand will be met by other types of meat from larger animals and traditional recipes using offal such as intestines and spleen will be banned. We therefore oppose the Commission proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has certainly devoted considerable time on behalf of its citizens to addressing the important agenda of food safety, while at the same time ensuring that our farmers can operate within a production framework of traceability which is the only way to fully restore consumer confidence in the wide range of quality food products produced by European farmers. For this reason, the creation of a uniform legal basis for controlling and preventing the spread of BSE and scrapie is paramount and there is still, as other speakers have suggested, a lack of consistency in relation to the application of the regulations within individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge Commissioner Byrne to prioritise introduction of that level of consistency which is the only way that we can convince our consumers that we have a common policy in relation to ensuring public health. As I have said in previous debates, farmers are the victims of circumstances beyond their control and those responsible for the manufacture of animal feed which puts public health, our entire livestock sector and indeed farm incomes at risk, have much to answer for. This House must be vigilant in ensuring that it can never again be repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the availability of rapid diagnostic testing for improved detection of TSEs in cattle and believe, Commissioner, that further consideration should be given to its use as a means of establishing the health status of animals in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For my country, Ireland, food exports and in particular beef are of paramount importance to our economy and the income of farmers. I can say that we have left no stone unturned in tackling this problem, including the removal of entire herds where an infected animal has in fact been diagnosed.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say in conclusion that farmers have always responded in a positive way to the introduction of regulations governing public health and the health status of animals raised for food production. Their task as guarantors of food security and quality is, as everyone in this House knows, becoming increasingly difficult. Far too often their contribution to society has been taken for granted and certainly not always adequately rewarded with a reasonable income.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martinez (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Böge, Commissioner, we have before us a proposal for a regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which is to say degeneration of the brain in bovine animals, sheep, primates, antelope, cats and even humans, since there have been 53 cases of atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob in Great Britain, all fatal.</p>
<p class="contents">So now we are going to adopt regulations to prevent an epidemic that we have known about since 1986, i.e. for fourteen years. It is rather late in the day to react, but even so over the last fourteen years we have done a great deal. Last month, for example, we decided to stick labels on meat to warn consumers. The Commission told us that it was impossible to enforce such labelling before 2002, sixteen years after the outbreak of the disease, but we have done something all the same. We have had discussions with Mr Delors, with Mr Santer, with Mr Prodi, with Mr McSharry, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, then Mr Steichen, and Mr Fischler. We have set up a committee of inquiry chaired by our fellow Member, Mr Böge, a temporary monitoring committee; we have even tabled a motion of censure, against Mr Böge’s wishes. We have heard expert opinions from Mr Dirringer, the German virologist, Mr Picoud, Mr Dormont, Scottish specialists, our Portuguese fellow Member, Garcia, was a specialist. We have had debates, topical and urgent questions on the embargo, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">After fourteen years of discussion, there are few survivors of this war of nigh on twenty years – Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, Mr Cunha, Mr Böge, and myself. Mr Happart left us and Mr Pagel died. So I think it would be useful for the more recent Members, in the end, if I gave a sort of debriefing on the subject, quite apart from the problems with the legal basis under Article 100 A or BSE monitoring problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point for this business was the 1984 milk quotas. To improve their milk reference, our British friends drove their cows like some sort of engines, overfeeding them, and, in order to save on the cost of fodder, they fed their cows on meal made from carcasses. Then, again, to save fuel oil when manufacturing meal, they reduced the cooking temperature, thereby enabling the pathogen to survive. BSE is the tragic product of the race for profits and the British farm model.</p>
<p class="contents">The disease has been identified since 1986, but nothing much was done until 1996. Why not? The public could not be thrown into a panic because the Maastricht Treaty had to be sold to them. So the press, the Commission and the European Parliament all knew about it, but did not say a word. So when, in March 1996, the British, via the British Ministers for Agriculture and Health, admitted that the disease could be transmitted to human beings, the necessary measures were not taken. Why? Because this time the reason the public could not be thrown into a panic was no longer to sell the Maastricht Treaty but the Treaty of Amsterdam. So, met first with silence and then with lies, the epidemic spread and we all know what the outcome of that was.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, BSE has not been eradicated in Great Britain, and will not be eradicated. Secondly, the belated ban on meal did not serve to eradicate contamination. Thirdly, either contamination crossed over to the meal fed to poultry, or there is a third transmission route. In addition to maternal contamination, there may be transmission via the fields, the grazing land, the grass, and there may be badlands, as in the case of ovine scrapie, where the prion would be encysted and would return as soon as bovine animals were put to pasture there. Fourthly, Great Britain and the industrialists causing the contamination have not, as polluters, paid. It is innocent farmers, grain farmers, who are paying the price, in the same way that the farmers are paying for Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, then, the directive and the regulation are all well and good, but they are somewhat hypocritical. We all agree that we need regulations on prevention, we are all agreed on adopting the amendments from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to whom the matter should have been referred. We all agree that scientific measures are needed, methods to be used in abattoirs to remove the ilia, the ganglia, the duodena, the inguinal, medial, lateral, renal, prefemoral and cervical lymph nodes, but this is not the key issue. In the BSE crisis, at the moment of truth, when protective action had to be taken, it was taken by the national states. That is the main lesson to be learnt from the TSE business. Firstly, protection is always led by the states. Secondly, the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations. This is no obstacle to the construction of Europe but, like children making tree houses, it is just a game. That is what we are doing here, Mr President, all playing out together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just the cows that went mad, and as a result, ovine scrapie spread to bovine animals in the form of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer welfare demands that we use every means possible to prevent and vigorously combat these diseases and their vectors. The action taken in 1997 is now proving even more inadequate as scientists are today talking about a third transmission route. We must therefore provide ourselves with effective means to eradicate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies once and for all, if at all possible. This means coordinating and dealing with the sector as soon as waste is used in animal fodder, destroying at-risk materials if there is suspicion, banning the inclusion of animal protein in cattle fodder, demanding traceability by labelling the animal’s site of birth and rearing, and, at Member State level, setting up the local monitoring systems which are the only ways to guarantee that the campaign will be effective and that monitoring will be transparent, setting in place a fast, systematic screening procedure and also in-depth checks, if necessary. Finally, the whole herd must be slaughtered if one beast is found to be infected. This is the price of food safety, but it must not be used as an excuse to cast doubt on the transportation of live animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, our goal has to be total elimination, but we feel that this would be extremely difficult as the costs of incinerating the large numbers of animals which die on farms are objectively huge. Consequently, the economic burdens and the amount of technical organisation involved could be extensive, and so could the environmental impact of such large-scale incineration carried out at extremely high temperatures. In this sense, we ought to ask the Commission – and insist on a reply – whether realistic estimates of the quantities of material to be incinerated are already available to us, whether they have already been made or whether this still remains to be done, according to the various classification procedures of the States, together with an evaluation of the resulting organisational economic burdens, with subsequent referral to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential to prevent the adoption of different, uncoordinated paths by individual Member States from causing substantial distortion of competition and disproportion in the treatment reserved for producers. It is necessary to provide for the adoption of harmonised financial support measures, lay down common organisational guidelines and use applied research measures to develop new disposal technologies with less environmental impact which allow the use of forms of materials recycling which respect consumer safety requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">The development of common guidelines should allow firmer, more balanced and, therefore, more effective responses. For example, we consider that setting up mandatory disposal consortia according to the model already laid down by the legislation of some Member States could be a practical response to the need to limit the economic impact of disposal operations on breeders and, at the same time, thanks to the increase in the degree of social control over the proper use of the service, to the need to consolidate consumer and environmental guarantees. </p>
<p class="contents">We conclude that the adoption of the excellent regulation in question will require the development of a combination of initiatives, research and analysis, but also regulation and standardisation, and we hope that Parliament will associate itself with these measures.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective is to gather into one dossier all regulations relating to TSEs to date. If we are to restore consumer confidence, it is essential that we do all we possibly can at all levels. I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the vigour she has shown in her approach to this matter – many of her proposals deserve agreement. Mr Böge, for his part, has ensured that these views will gain wide support in this Chamber. I agree that the Commission for its part has done a good job, a job that Parliament can endorse, whereas Member States must eventually be made to understand that this matter is important and that we must gain consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to draw your attention to one more issue: those countries and farms, which have escaped the animal diseases, must also be able to ensure that they will not have these problems in future. It is therefore essential that the withdrawal period relating to the transfer of animals from one farm to another be increased from two years to six years. On the whole, we must firmly hold to the notion that within the internal market, too, human health is the most important thing, and that principles of free competition only take second place. It is imperative that we bear this in mind, particularly when dealing with these food matters, which are all-important to consumers.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report and to thank her for her openness to discussion on the issues involved. She will appreciate even better than I how far scientific opinion on TSEs has developed. For example, the Scientific Steering Committee has recently established that it is necessary to regard the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglion as specified risk material in the UK only for bovines over 30 months and in Portugal only for those over 6 months. That is why some of us seek an Amendment No 56 to allow adjustments in this area on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee rather than requiring fresh legislation to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, certain measures in combating TSEs have already proved effective. I refer to the exclusion of animals over 30 months from the food chain, the slaughter and disposal of suspects and offspring of BSE cases, a fully effective feed ban and the removal of a wide range of specified risk materials. Where such measures are in place, in seems unnecessary to impose the more technical requirement of the date-based export scheme and the certified animal scheme to the domestic market; hence, Amendment No 53.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, given that there is no evidence of horizontal transmission of TSEs, there would seem to be no scientific requirement for whole-herd slaughter. While accepting that some Member States may wish to engage in the practice, I would submit that it should not be compulsory. Indeed, we take TSE and BSE very seriously in the United Kingdom. We are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare. We only ask that given that we have taken these measures which we believe to be effective, you do not ask to us to take additional measures which have no scientific justification for them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This twofold concern seems to be particularly justified today, as French experience shows. The fact is that considering the range of measures already undertaken, such as the ban on animal-protein meal for bovine animals, the incidence of mad cow disease in France should have started to decline, but this is not the case, and in fact the number of cases is on the increase. It is this tendency which presents a problem right now, much more than the scale of the epidemic in quantitative terms. The truth is, at the present time, there is quite simply no adequate explanation for it, hence the debate which has been initiated on the possible existence of alternative disease transmission routes of which we are, as yet, unaware. Medical and scientific uncertainty still prevails.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, the precautionary principle must be adopted to the full. All possible resources must be used in order to assess the BSE situation in the various countries, particularly including the development and systematic use of fast screening tests. The development of BSE in France raises issues that are not purely medical in the narrowest sense. This is nothing new. From the very beginning, it has not been possible to give any explanation for the emergence of this disease and its transmission to human beings, and its spread internationally, without taking the key socio-economic factors into account: contemporary trends in the agro-industry, the subordination of producers and consumers to the dominating rationale of capitalistic profit.</p>
<p class="contents">Still today, the way in which the agro-industry is organised, and the fact that it is infiltrated by international mafia-like networks, make the fight to eradicate BSE and TSEs even more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">No public health policy should ignore these factors. They are, however, discussed only on rare occasions and in little detail by the European institutions, including Parliament. Basically, BSE is one of those medical matters which, in practical and terribly human terms, bears witness to the acute nature of the choices that society makes, and that is yet another reason why preventing TSEs is a political matter to which Parliament’s responsibility is truly committed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can also vouch for the necessity of maintaining effective controls. You might therefore expect me to be enthusiastic about these new controls on BSE, but I am not. We already have enough and I believe they are adequate and effective. This proposal simply adds more red tape and costs to an already overburdened industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I have no objections to other countries adopting measures which match ours. In fact, it would be helpful if measures already in place in the UK were implemented throughout the EU and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus it is not new laws we need – we need more compliance. Until all Member States are able to assure us that there is full compliance, this proposal, if passed, will simply add to the list of laws which have not been implemented. In any case, if more controls were needed, we should not be looking to the Commission for guidance. The British BSE inquiry which was commissioned by the UK Government at a cost of £20 million is due to report in November.

Her approach and hence her report is one we can wholeheartedly support.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation is not a major revolution, but it does attempt nonetheless to afford a higher level of protection, based, moreover, on the most stringent practices adopted in specific European Union countries, such as in France.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to draw your attention to a number of specific points and, firstly, the existence of a third transmission route which is now practically certain. I think it essential in this case to define suspect animals quite apart from the age criterion. The age criterion ceases to be justified as soon as we are practically assured that this third transmission route does in fact exist. The important thing, then, is to have systematic recourse to testing whenever an animal dies of unknown causes. Systematic testing precludes fraud and makes it possible to offer better guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of slaughtering herds has been discussed at length. In both France and Germany the whole herd is slaughtered if a single animal is found to be diseased. We know that this is not the practice in Great Britain, and that this is a solution which is vigorously opposed by our fellow Members from the United Kingdom. But is it possible to put the argument of the costs of destroying a herd when a public health issue is involved? I think this is not a tenable position. It is important for the regulations of the various countries of the European Union to be harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, finally, like to talk about at-risk materials, these notorious substances which may present risks. Once again, in France, a number of measures have been implemented, which have been more or less understood, but I am convinced that it is essential to be extremely vigilant and to apply the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">So this regulation is a good one. It represents some progress, but it is capable of being perfected rather than perfect as it stands. It does not raise any questions concerning the incineration of animal-based meal. In some of our countries, we have stockpiles of such meal which we do not yet know how best to destroy, or which has not been destroyed sufficiently, and also animal-based meal used for swine and poultry. I think, Commissioner, that these are questions we also have to ask. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to say a few words on the debate. I would like to thank the honourable Members who have spoken so far, and Mrs Doyle, Mr Goodwill and Mr Nicholson, who have yet to speak, for what they have to say and for the fair treatment we are giving each other. Those who sat in Parliament during the last parliamentary term know that it is Parliament which has cause to be proud of having got a grip on the BSE disaster in the individual committees and in the House as a whole, in a way which cut across the political divide.</p>
<p class="contents">I tried at all times, as chair of the committee, to be fair to all the Member States, strict but fair, as my teachers always used to say to me, and I am trying to do the same now. Allow me therefore to say a few words on some of the points raised. Yes, Mr Trakatellis and others are right, Mr Staes. We still have no tests for live animals. We still have no tests for very early infection, which is why the Commission is being called upon to keep on working on this, and I know that it is doing so. Of course we need that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Whitehead said quite clearly that safety must be a priority, but he would, of course, like the precautionary principle to be applied in equal measure in other Member States and that is the main point here. To some members who have spoken or who have perhaps yet to speak I should like to state one thing quite clearly: we are legislating here for the whole of the European Union, for the 15 Member States with widely varying safety levels. We are not legislating just for Great Britain. We know that the data-based export scheme, that the OTS over-30-month scheme, that all these things are important and are working. I am the first to recognise what Great Britain has achieved and at what price to farmers. I have spoken to countless officials and farmers’ representatives in Great Britain over recent years and I know that. Nonetheless, I must ensure that this level of safety also applies to Italy, Germany and all the other countries in the European Union. Which is why I believe that this regulation is a good regulation. When Mrs Attwooll and others ask if we can have derogations for countries which are already that good and if they must still remove the spinal column, then I call on you, Mr Byrne, to table a proper list of derogations to the Council saying countries A, B, C and D comply and are exempt from certain measures. I will be the first to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do not want this to be rushed, as is the case with certain proposed amendments. This is why I stand by the position which I described earlier. I think that we really should stick with what we discussed in committee and with what Mrs Doyle and I have re-tabled. This particularly applies to proposed Amendment No 56, to which Mrs Attwooll referred. I will be the first to support this at second reading, if the Council makes the proposal, but we need to list clearly and to substantiate clearly where derogations are possible and under what conditions and for which Member State. What must the Member State do to qualify? And of course I support Mrs Grossetête: naturally, tests must be carried out on animals which have died from unknown causes but that is already included in the Commission’s proposal on the tests.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, at the outset I would like to add my thanks to Mrs Roth-Berendt and indeed Mr Böge for their commitment to this important issue. For some time Parliament, the Commission and Member States have sought the introduction of common EU-wide rules to deal with the problems of TSEs such as BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep. The basis of this proposal is that the discovery of any TSE or the first incidence of BSE in a Member State would be covered by common rules which would take effect automatically. To date, many of the actions taken to deal with BSE have been carried out on a unilateral basis by Members using national measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The TSE proposal being put forward includes, among other things, a requirement for educational programmes for farmers, vets and officials; the removal of a list of specified risk material, an active surveillance programme using rapid post-mortem tests; and the strengthening of the ban on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminant animals. The proposal also allows for the culling of animals and the compensation to farmers for loss of culled animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of this approach cannot be faulted. Common rules will enhance the protection of animal health and more importantly will ensure protection of the consumer by ensuring that the highest standards of disease prevention and eradication are put in place in every Member State and can be activated when appropriate. These rules will form a blueprint that can be followed in the event of any new scientific information being made available or if more radical action is required. However, I am aware, Commissioner, that the vast majority of Member States are of the opinion that the classification of countries for SRM removal purposes should be based on an internationally recognised code set out and agreed by the EU and the many – over 150 third countries – under the auspices of the OIE, the World Organisation of Animal Health, which is based in Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">Most Member States are uneasy about the approach being taken by the scientific sub-groups and would prefer a more open and transparent system of classification as set out in the OIE code which is recognised and accepted by countries worldwide. This view was made plain in Council working groups and was reflected in the final draft Presidency Proposal, a draft that is supported by the vast majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For the purpose of agreement and the speedy implementation of this regulation and hopefully to avoid a lengthy conciliation process, the use of common OIE criteria would be appropriate. Having discussed this with Mrs Roth-Berendt, we have tabled Amendment No 51 to Article 5 as a compromise to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the principle of laying down common rules for the prevention and control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. However, this proposal may have negative consequences for countries trading in sheep and this is an important point as it currently stands. There is a view that there should be separate rules for scrapie rather than the current mix of rules where the treatment of SRM in sheep depends on the BSE incidence in that particular country.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate in conclusion my support for the use of OIE provisions to have an internationally recognised basis for classification, a basis supported by 150 countries in resolving world trade disputes and recognised by the WTO. I make no case for leniency of treatment at all. The UK would be in class 4, Ireland would be in class 3 under either classification system, the SSC or the OIE. The OIE meets next week in Paris to consider amendments to their classification system and consequently I hope to bring further amendments to this regulation for second reading.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goodwill (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, legislation which seeks to protect the public from a terrible brain disease such as new variant CJD should be drafted to complement measures already in place in Member States, to recognise the stage of the epidemic that we are at and have due regard to the body of scientific knowledge we have built up. The United Kingdom already has comprehensive and effective measures in place to protect human health and eradicate BSE in our herd. This is working. Cases of BSE are declining rapidly. But most importantly, so far, we have not had a case in an animal born since the complete feed ban was introduced. That should be happening around about now, if it was going to. No older animals over 30 months of age enter the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is likely that cases may occur due to maternal transmission but these will be isolated and not feed-related, and there is no justification for a return to cohort culling. Incidentally – and Mrs Grossetête referred to this – there has been recent press speculation about a third possible infection route through grass contaminated by faecal material. This only applies – as I understand – to animals excreting pathogens ingested with contaminated feed, not, as some newspapers inferred, from animals incubating or suffering from this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the practicality and cost of having to post-mortem all animals for which the cause of death is unknown. Very large numbers of animals die of natural causes or common ailments. BSE is a degenerative disease which does not cause sudden death anyway. Amendment No 26 seeks universally to impose the whole-herd slaughter policy which some Member States with low levels of incidence have introduced in an attempt to reassure the public. This could well result in the under-reporting of cases, as we have seen in Switzerland recently. BSE is not an infectious disease that is transmitted horizontally. Whole-herd slaughter has no scientific justification. The majority of herds that have experienced BSE in the UK have had only one or two isolated cases. Most herds in Britain are not closed herds and therefore animals come in from all over the place. If one of those animals gets a disease, why kill the whole herd?</p>
<p class="contents">Whole-herd slaughter is not an effective way of reducing cases of BSE. It would cost a small fortune for no tangible benefit. I hope Parliament, in amending this directive, will do so in the light of sound scientific advice, not as a knee-jerk reaction to tabloid newspaper scare stories.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can I first of all thank you very much for giving me the floor and can I pay tribute to the rapporteur and indeed to Mr Böge. As someone who was in the last Parliament I know how much thankless time and effort they have put in since BSE first began in a very difficult area to try and find a resolution and a way forward to help everyone in a very sensible way. I think both of them not only take credit for themselves but indeed bring credit to this Parliament for the way in which they have carried out that duty.</p>
<p class="contents">BSE has unfortunately been with us for some considerable time and I suspect that we have to recognise that it will probably be with us for some years ahead. We have to try to find ways by which we can control the disease of BSE and TSE and at the same time create the consumer confidence that is needed because consumer confidence has been lost. With respect to Mr Martinez I will only say one word to him – sludge. I will say no more as far as that is concerned. Everybody has problems in the European Union of one type or the other and no-one should try to make or take advantage of the other's problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, whatever we do, we should not overburden the producer because he has already been considerably overburdened. As to the argument whether you slaughter the whole of the herd, there is no scientific evidence to say you should. There are many instances in my area where maybe BSE occurred five, six or seven years ago in one animal and there has never been another case since. Once we get to the stage where we have a vaccine or some way of identifying or testing if an animal has BSE, then there is an argument for testing the rest of the herd and if there is a trigger level whereby it goes beyond that, then the whole herd should be taken out. But it would be wilful carnage to simply go in and slaughter good animals in the thought or the notion that BSE may possibly be in the whole herd. That would be a drastic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">One other point: where I come from, in recent years there has been a continuing downward trend. Indeed, in Northern Ireland last year, we only had, I think, three identifiable cases of BSE and the projection for this year is one or at worst maybe two. I was listening to what the rapporteur said that if there are clear reasons then she would agree for areas that have low instances of BSE to have certain controls and mechanisms. That is an important thing to recognise because in my area farmers feel very secure because of the very low instances we have of BSE and because of the strict controls that we have monitored and made sure worked over recent years. That is perhaps why our situation is much better than the rest of the United Kingdom. This is an area which has to be looked at in the months ahead – we must create the confidence within ourselves that we can begin to move forward as we begin, hopefully, to see the back of the TSE/BSE problem.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(FI) </span>– Mr President, I would like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on her excellent report. The report that we now have before us is an example of the kind of issue which requires of us the ability to demonstrate that the European Parliament places public health before internal market considerations. The EC Treaty – for instance, Article 30 and points 4 and 8 of Article 95 of that Treaty – presents us with both the opportunity and the duty to do so. The priority is to protect consumer health, particularly against diseases like TSE, the mode of infection of which is not adequately known and the testing of which so far is only possible after the symptoms have developed. Secondarily – and this is justified by the notion of the internal market – we must be able to restore consumer confidence in the foods on the market in order to enable the market to function with a minimum of disruption. Both issues are important, but we must be able to show clearly the priority of values; public health comes first.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted a position that allows both of these objectives to be met. One important aspect of this view is the whole-herd slaughter on a farm where disease has been discovered. Even without knowledge of whether any of the other animals have become infected, this action is nevertheless justifiable, precisely in order for the above objectives to be met. At the same time, we must, of course, ensure that the breeder receives proper compensation for his livestock. In addition, the internal market must be able to operate in such a way that the spread of the disease is checked, and so that Member States, where no disease has yet occurred, can rely on the Community to protect the animal population of those States. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I prepared a proposal for an amendment on this matter myself, stating as reasons for the issue specifically the above-mentioned prioritisation of values, where public health is the first. This objective has now been met in the Committee report – in a slightly different, but nevertheless satisfactory manner. Extending the period referred to in the Annex to the Regulation (the scrapie-free period) from two years to six, may be an adequate means of ensuring that the imported animals and processed material are risk-free, and of preventing the spread of the disease to countries where it does not yet exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to the Commission’s proposal, the report refers to instant tests, which are being used to detect TSE, by name. This in itself is acceptable, but we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a technology which is continually being developed. Hopefully, better tests than the current ones will soon be available, and when the time comes, it will be important that the currently approved regulations are kept up to date with the advances in technology.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I am pleased to outline our position on your amendments to our proposed regulation on the prevention and control of TSEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to begin by thanking you for the excellent cooperation between your assistants and my services. Due to this thorough preparation I am in a position today to agree in full or in part to almost three-quarters of your proposed amendments. Furthermore, most of the amendments, which I am not in a position to accept, relate to two issues: the so-called "whereas" clauses – that is the recitals – and whether or not changes to certain provisions of the regulation should be by commitology or codecision. That is an issue which I have referred to before. I know it is a controversial issue and I look forward to discussing this particular issue in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which is scheduled for July.</p>
<p class="contents">In substance, therefore, the Commission and Parliament are equally committed to a strong regulation which puts in place a comprehensive framework to tackle TSEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like especially to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge for their huge contribution to this proposal. I can think of no other individuals who have made such a positive contribution to tackling BSE. They have both rendered an enormous service to the health protection of Europe's citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I might also add that this piece of legislation is an excellent example of the good work and cooperation which has taken place between our two institutions and could provide a precedent for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the specific amendments and formal Commission position. Firstly, on commitology, we accept Amendments Nos 6, 11, 12, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36. With regard to the recitals, I also accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5. However, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2 because it is inappropriate to introduce recitals in a piece of legislation which are not matched by substantive provisions in the text. However, I shall be raising your concerns on pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, which a number of you mentioned, with my colleague Mr Liikanen and I will ask him to address those concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the articles themselves, firstly, the scope: I accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8. With regard to definitions: I can partly accept Amendments No 9 to Article 13 on the definition of TSE suspected animals. But the inclusion of "fallen cattle, sheep and goats" in the definition cannot be accepted. It is not practicable to collect, incinerate and carry out a full epidemiological investigation on each fallen animal. The Commission will, however, be monitoring the situation closely both through the recently agreed measures on random testing for BSE and in the forthcoming proposal on animal waste. However, I accept Amendment No 52.</p>
<p class="contents">I also accept Amendments Nos 10 and 49 to Article 3, with a slight reformulation to create the possibility of delegating the evaluation, not the approval, of tests to an external body.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to classification, BSE status: I accept Amendments Nos 13, 14, 51 and 58.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to epidemiological surveillance: I accept Amendment No 15 to Article 7, introducing the mandatory use of the rapid diagnostic tests in the annual monitoring programme. Let me add, however, in passing, that we will keep under constant review the scope for increased testing of animals for BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">On specified risk material: unfortunately I cannot accept Amendments Nos 16, 17, 18, 40 and 41 to Article 8, bringing under codecision the approval and conditions for use of rapid diagnostic tests. I happen to believe that it is essential to maintain the flexibility of the commitology procedure. Nor can I accept that tests should be capable of detecting infectivity in all products and at all stages of the disease. That is the advice I have been given.</p>
<p class="contents">I partly accept Amendment No 19 to Article 8, requesting a review of the age limits for SRM removal under a commitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, accept the restraint of annual reviews and, in particular, the proposed deadline for the first review which is foreseen for 1 January next, which is too soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I also accept Amendment No 20 to Article 8, which brings under codecision the principle of granting derogations from the provisions on SRM removal in high-risk areas or for taking account of an effective feed ban.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome Amendments Nos 38, 39 and 56 to Annex IV. They mainly propose no longer requiring the designation of long bones of cattle as SRM and suggest a reformulation of the proposed derogation for the removal of a vertebral column under a commitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">On feed ban, I accept Amendments Nos 22 and 42. I can partly accept Amendments Nos 21 and 57 on condition that the possibility of extending the feed ban is allowed, irrespective of risk status. I also partly accept Amendment No 54 to Annex V, laying down the detailed rules on the extended feed ban. I cannot accept the derogation for dicalcium phosphate, as this is against our scientific advice. I also cannot accept the limitation of extending the feed ban to any species, mainly pet animals, only if a risk of cross-contamination of livestock feed exists, as we believe that ruminant protein should be banned for all susceptible species. I identify cats here in particular. That is the advice I have been given in relation to cats.</p>
<p class="contents">I can partly accept Amendment No 50 to Annex V where it exempts gelatine from hides from the ban. However, I cannot accept the exemption for feeding cats with ruminant protein from the ban.</p>
<p class="contents">I also cannot accept Amendment No 23 to Article 9, ensuring immediate application of the feed prohibitions, as this amendment does not fully make sense legally.</p>
<p class="contents">On disease eradication: I accept Amendments Nos 25 and 28. I also welcome Amendment No 24 to Article 11, but propose to reformulate, providing for "regular" rather than "immediate" notification.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also partly accept Amendment No 26 to Article 13 and Amendment No 43 to Annex VII, introducing whole-herd slaughter for BSE in cattle, sheep and goats and, secondly, excluding research animals from these provisions. Whole-herd slaughter for BSE only, not for scrapie, is acceptable to me on condition of approval of equivalent measures by commitology. I cannot accept the second part of this amendment as it is in fact superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">I can partly accept Amendment No 44 on condition that the equivalent measures are approved on a case-by-case basis under commitology.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not accept Amendment No 27 to Article 13, requiring a complete standstill on a holding with a confirmed TSE case, as I consider the extremely strict conditions of our proposals are already sufficient, as they require measures to be taken under strict, official veterinary supervision, duly certified.</p>
<p class="contents">I also cannot accept Amendment No 37 to Annex II, as the proposed definition is not used elsewhere in the text and is, in addition, inadequate for TSE control purposes. I should add that ADNS regions are too small and too difficult to control. Bigger regions which are legally defined may be possible, for instance the Azores, and I refer to what Mr Nicholson said earlier about Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">On the conditions for marketing animals: we welcome the intention of Amendment No 53 to Article 16. However, I propose to reformulate the text to ensure approval of the equivalent schemes by commitology. I also welcome the intention of Amendment No 45 to Annex VIII, but would ask for flexibility to determine the exact duration of the scrapie-free period. I cannot accept Amendment No 55 to Annex VIII, reducing the protection measures against scrapie. Furthermore, I cannot accept Amendment No 46 to Annex VIII, extending the ban on placing on the market offspring of TSE cases, for lack of scientific support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on laboratory techniques, I accept Amendments Nos 47 and 48.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you again for your cooperation. I sincerely hope that this will continue to be a hugely important proposal and that we shall continue our cooperation on it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
