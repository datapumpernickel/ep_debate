<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Bladel </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate on the granting of EUR 20 million in macro‐financial assistance to Albania, I think it is extremely important to look at the political and economic context in which the assistance is being provided. Let me pick out a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">Albania freed itself from Marxist dictatorship much later than other countries in the eastern bloc, and this means that the problems of developing a pluralist society are persisting for longer than in any of the other countries, where some progress has been made. The economic and social conditions are such that, in my view, Albania can rightly be described as a third world country on the Union"s doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">The collapse of the pyramid schemes, the plundering of the munitions depots – which we all remember very clearly: a Kalashnikov now has a street value of five to ten dollars – the effects of the conflict in neighbouring Kosovo: all of these things have led to the enormous tide of refugees who are now on the move, with economic refugees coming to the Union and political refugees fleeing Kosovo for Albania.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Albania does not just have serious internal problems to resolve. Because of its geographical situation, it cannot escape being politically influenced by surrounding countries in the Balkans. Mr Imbeni made this point very clearly during the Kosovo debate yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some glimmers of hope. Last November a new constitution was approved with a 90 % turnout, and a new leader, Mr Majko, seems to be making good progress towards guaranteeing independent roles for the president, the legislature and the judiciary. However, Albania"s political recovery is closely linked to the priorities to be met for economic recovery. Last October, the Albanian authorities in Tirana assured the group of donors that they will promote the development of an action plan to combat corruption and introduce legislation to create the climate needed to encourage investment, which is currently at a very low level – there is almost no investment from outside the country – so that investors will also have a better guarantee of getting their money back in future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important here to monitor whether the new Customs Code does indeed consolidate customs and tax revenue collection, and then the main concern is the further winding‐up of the pyramid selling companies, though it is still not known whether Albanians will ever see any of their money again. Unfortunately, we can do nothing to ensure that they do.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1991 the European Union has been the largest donor to Albania, and in view of the country"s economic and financial situation, international aid is still desperately needed, if only to keep the current account going. This is why it is vital that we should flesh out the ECOFIN Council decision of last April as quickly as possible. The Commission is in an excellent position to do this, with its considerable experience of Albania. Up to now we have mainly provided donations, but this time it is a loan. However, in my view we must prevent Albania from falling into the disastrous vicious circle of being financially dependent on outside help.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, in the extremely successful cooperation which I had with Mr Brinkhorst from the Committee on Budgets, for which I would like to thank him – unfortunately he could not be here this evening – I proposed that a coherent assessment should be made of the direction and state of progress of the political and institutional reforms in Albania. I have therefore asked the Commission not just to rely on the technical evaluations of international financial bodies such as the IMF, but to involve the Committee on Monetary Affairs and the PHARE committee in its assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is for Parliament to have a comprehensive picture of the reforms before the second tranche is paid. The intention is not to put Albania under the microscope, but to promote sound and efficient management. In my opinion, this is not just what EU citizens want, it is what Albanian citizens want as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the members of the Committee on External Economic Relations for their critical yet supportive views, and I hope that tomorrow the House will accept the amendments which are before us, because almost a year has already passed between the ECOFIN decision and the start of implementation, and Albania is simply raring to go.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Karamanou </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Madam President, we know that Albania is still facing many intractable problems, especially problems in connection with internal security and public order which are affecting all other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in the midst of all these problems, relatively speaking I am amazed at the success this small country has had in implementing the six‐month contingency programme from October 1997 to March 1998, which allowed it to tackle the social crisis and the civil war in the spring of 1997. We therefore have initial proof at least that, by following a specific programme in a well‐disciplined manner and with adequate technical support, the Albanian Government can be effective and make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as was clear from the serious regression which took place in September last year, the problems of Albania centre more around the lack of communication and dialogue among the country"s political powers and their inability to reach agreement on a minimum joint programme to extricate the country once and for all from the crisis it is in, rather than on the genuinely deep economic recession.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and international organisations must give generously all the help they possibly can to enable this country to find positive solutions to its problems. Albania is part of Europe, it has contributed to the history of Europe and, from this standpoint, it is a potential applicant country for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It must nevertheless be made clear to all the political powers in Albania that responsibility for the progress and future prospects of the country lie fairly and squarely with them. The European Union is granting macro‐financial aid to support the efforts made by Albania, but this must in no way be taken as a shifting of responsibilities. The Albanian Government must intensify its own efforts to solve its problems, and it must push forward policies and economic reforms to ensure that democratic institutions run smoothly and that the rule of law operates correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the constitution was of course a major step in the right direction. However, we must have guarantees that human rights will be respected, that there will be a smooth transition to a market economy, financial stability and, above all, a revitalisation of the credit system. Corruption must be stamped out and organised crime combated. Structures and procedures must be created to guarantee transparency and to ensure that public money is handled honestly. Only in this way can a climate of security be created for investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 20 million are rather less than what the Albanian Government had hoped for and, more importantly, less than what the country needs to tackle its problems. Nevertheless, strengthening the credibility of the country and ensuring economic and political stability will gradually increase its ability to take on loans and, above all, will attract foreign investments, which Albania desperately needs.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that my country, Greece, sincerely hopes that progress will be made, and it supports in every way the attempts of the Albanian Government to carry forward the necessary policies and institutional reforms which will bring Albania closer to the European model.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schwaiger </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs van Bladel for her excellent report. It has our full support. As she said, and as my honourable colleague Mrs Karamanou has just stated, Albania is not only one of the weakest countries in economic terms, it is also lagging far behind the other countries in the development of democratic structures. Its situation is similar to that of Bosnia‐Herzegovina; in other words, Albania has to be financially drip‐fed by the European Union. We not only provide food aid. We not only provide general reconstruction aid. The European Union also spends money on the refugees from Kosovo who have found a temporary abode in Albania.</p>
<p class="contents">But the crucial point – and this is where we start to see the light – is that the last government reshuffle and the adoption of a constitution in Albania have laid the foundation stone for the construction of a stable system of government. It is important to us, of course, to have a partner in whom we can have at least a reasonable degree of trust, and whom we can provide with the necessary funds to develop the structures of government and to ensure that the police and the armed forces return to their role as servants of the democratic order instead of being a law unto themselves, with all the problems which that has entailed in Albania over the past two to three years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also crucial that Albania should gradually win over the confidence of the international financial system and of investors, that Albania should thereby become an interesting location for prospective investors in the long run, and that at the same time the conditions should be created in which welfare capitalism can flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come a long way. What we must do is to make sure that the control which is now required can also be extended to cover macrofinancial aid to a certain degree. The very idea of macrofinancial aid, of course, is that it is not designed to fund specific projects, but to provide the state with a pool of funds with which it can perform and develop the tasks of government. But I nevertheless consider it important that we strike a good balance between trust and verification, a balance that will also encourage the Albanians, the Albanian Government, to progress along the right path.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that this financial aid of ours represents a small mosaic tile that Albania needs in order to go on constructing a stable future, and I hope that we shall soon see appropriate verification measures from the Commission to help ensure that this goal is achieved.</p>

Our group supports them in their entirety. As regards the aid, although we feel this should be granted under the most favourable conditions possible for the time being, there must also, of course, be a number of conditions attached, as both the Commission and the rapporteur propose.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just mention one of these. We think that it is high time that the investigation into the pyramid selling schemes was completed; the capital collected should be paid out to the creditors and legislation should be introduced to combat money laundering. The schemes demonstrate the need for better financial controls on all sorts of institutions, including banks.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, the greatest risk still remains, as the rapporteur pointed out, that one hand will be paying out what the other receives, in other words that one loan will be applied for in order to pay another loan off. This would be a disastrous development for a country that does not need one loan after another but productive investment, including from the European Union, so that it can generate its own, independent economic development. This is what Albania needs in the long run.</p>

Obviously the European Union has made a good many mistakes over Albania, and this EUR 20 million loan will not fundamentally change the situation. That said, this loan will be something of a shot in the arm for Mr Majko, who is making heroic efforts but has very little room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the European Union"s general attitude on Albania which is wrong. We are witnessing the growth of criminal activity, encouraged ultimately by the European Union. The Union should be far bolder in its policy. We should do what to some extent our Greek friends are doing – but not other countries, starting with Italy – and set very generous immigration quotas in order to break the power of mafia groups which feed on the traffic in labour and other commodities, such as drugs. We should generously open our universities and give thousands of study grants to Albanian students. Measures are needed to block the rise of opposition to the legal authorities in Albania, to prevent pyramid selling operations and situations of general political instability, notwithstanding the good intentions and intelligence of the current Albanian leadership. In the absence of such measures, Albania will mark time for a good many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Vice‐President of the Commission in particular and the Commission in general to urge the Member States not to regularise the situation after the event, as has been done now in Italy, where 250 000 people have been legalised as immigrants – because in the meantime the emigration mafia have netted their profits. We should act ahead of the event and set quotas in all countries of the European Union. I think that if the burden were spread over the Union as a whole it would not be too severe, and this is what we need to do to tackle the root of the problem.</p>

I believe that when we speak of Albania, we must not forget that it is a country which has had to make an unimaginably huge leap forward within a few years and still has an enormous amount of ground to make up. During the Enver Hoxha era the country was virtually dragged back into the Stone Age, and now it needs to progress by leaps and bounds at a time when the entire surrounding region is far from stable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe our aid can only be a drop in the ocean, but it may serve a useful purpose inside the country, helping to overcome the barriers that exist there. We must remember that Albania is divided into two large areas, the north and the south, with the Gegs and the Tosks respectively, traditional enemies who naturally continued to wage war during the Stone Age into which Enver Hoxha led the country, and that many of the conflicts we see today have their roots in that antithesis. It is even reflected in the party structure we find in Albania today.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Albanian constitution has naturally raised high hopes. I very much hope that it will be possible to give the opposition a suitably constructive role to play in the Albanian political system, because I believe it has adopted very constructive positions in many areas. Only then will it be possible for Albania to bring the problems with its neighbours under some sort of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally – and this has been emphasised several times this evening – it will be necessary to introduce appropriate verification mechanisms. Only if these mechanisms exist, particularly in relation to the Albanian democratisation process, will the aid from the European Union be able to achieve anything. Many other verification measures have been mentioned, especially the mechanisms designed to curb the corruption, the arms trade and the drug trafficking that exist in Albania. We cannot achieve complete control in these areas; we can only do a little here to help the Albanians to help themselves, but we should do whatever we can. In that respect, Mrs van Bladel's report and the efficient aid that should result from it represent a step in the right direction.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellence of her report and also thank her for the support given by Parliament to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the macro‐financial assistance of a maximum of EUR 20m for Albania is to shore up the country's official exchange reserves. This operation forms part of the global strategy pursued by the international community, and in particular by the European Union, since the crisis began at the end of 1996. It supplements the actions we have taken under the PHARE programme, the priorities of which are institutional reform. The specific purpose of this operation is to support the programme of structural economic reforms embarked on by the government under the aegis of the IMF.</p>
<p class="contents">Even during and immediately after the crisis that broke out in the country at the end of 1996, after the collapse of the pyramid saving schemes, fiscal and monetary policy management was actually extremely prudent and, as a result, the macro‐economic situation has improved in recent months. The budget deficit as financed domestically has been reduced substantially, inflation has fallen dramatically, but the external payments position is still precarious. The shoring up of foreign exchange reserves that the Community operation will permit will, therefore, help the Albanian authorities in pursuing a prudent macro‐economic policy. Of course, the Commission will pay special attention to efforts to combat corruption by improving customs procedures and the management of public expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to some of the amendments: the Commission supports and welcomes Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 6, some of which, in particular No 3, will enable us to adopt a stronger negotiating position with the Albanians in sectors which we think are very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, our rejection of the other amendments stems from our concern to safeguard the effectiveness of the implementing arrangements and the integrity of the objectives being pursued. These implementing arrangements have stood the test in numerous similar operations managed by the Commission, and to make them unduly onerous would prejudice the effectiveness of the operation. For example, the mandate of the PHARE Committee does not provide for it to be consulted in advance on a macro‐financial operation and on the financial conditions attached to the associated borrowing and lending operations. But the Commission will ensure that the operation is fully consistent with and complements the objectives of the PHARE programme in Albania.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the proposed arrangements, the Commission will send to Parliament and the Council, at least once a year, a report evaluating how the decision is being implemented. It does not make sense to go beyond that. In the context of the evaluation provided for, the Commission will keep Parliament informed of the conditions attached to the loan. Furthermore, we are, of course, prepared to reply to any questions Parliament might put to us, both during the operation and after it has been completed. But negotiating the conditions of disbursement, which lies at the heart of such an operation, necessitates some room for manoeuvre and the observance of the confidentiality requirements that the authorities of the countries concerned might impose with regard to the substance and timetable of reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to protect the objectives of an operation designed to underpin stability and economic reform. Its scope would be over‐stretched if immediate policy objectives were also assigned to it. As we have invariably done in the past, the Commission will, of course, examine during the implementation phase whether the political context is compatible with disbursement in accordance with the principles of sound management.</p>
