<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marques (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now examining a Commission proposal for a Council decision on the indirect tax in force in the Canary Islands. The purpose of introducing a tax known as 'the AIEM tax on the import and delivery of goods in the Canary Islands’ is to allow Spain to apply lower rates of tax to certain products manufactured in this outermost region. It must be stated, of course, that the purpose of the Community authorisation is not to create the AIEM, because the Spanish authorities are free to do this, as long as Community directives on VAT and on special consumer taxes do not apply in the Canaries. The Council decision is, consequently, necessary, but to validate tax exemptions and their extension to Canarian regional products, an aspect that is not properly clarified in the Commission proposal. The aim of most of the amendments that I tabled, and which were approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, was to ensure that this clarification was made.</p>
<p class="contents">The central tenet of the Commission proposal is, therefore, the establishment of tax exemptions under Articles 23, 25 and 90 of the Treaty, on the grounds that discrimination is practised in favour of certain industrial goods manufactured in the Canaries over imported industrial goods, since the former can be taxed at rates 5, 15 or 25 percentage points lower, depending on the type of product concerned. Article 299(2) of the Treaty provides the justification and the legal base for these tax exemptions. This article acknowledges the unique situation of what are known as ‘outermost’ regions and the corresponding need for the European Union to take special steps to help those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal now under consideration deserves my total support. It seeks to enable regions such as the Canaries, which suffer serious competitive disadvantages in the industrial sector as a consequence of their remoteness, better to integrate and exploit the highly competitive dynamic of the single European market, of Economic and Monetary Union and of globalisation itself. This type of specific measure is crucial to ensuring the survival and modernisation of industrial activity in the Canaries, which now produces little more than 5% of regional GDP, when historically it has always generated very high levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The integration of the Canaries, however, into the customs territory of the European Union in 1991, and the gradual dismantling, by 1999, of the tax then in force, which was also intended to protect regional production, have accentuated the fragility and the vulnerability of the Canaries’ industrial sector to external competition. As the situation in the tobacco industry shows quite clearly, the decline has been steady. Between 1985 and 2000, the tobacco industry shed more than 3 300 jobs, or around 67% of its workforce. It is, therefore, imperative that we ask ourselves the following question: should the full integration of the Canaries mean that their industries are all but wiped out? Should the Canaries depend almost exclusively on tourism-related activities for job and wealth creation? Is this not too heavy a price for the Canaries to pay for their full integration into the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal that we are now looking at is, therefore, a legitimate and appropriate instrument for guaranteeing a minimum degree of economic diversification in a region with the specific characteristics of the Canaries.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is also justified, however, in light of other considerations, not least the competitive inequality suffered by industrial firms in the outermost regions. It is well known that remoteness imposes additional costs on industrial activity in these regions and that, in the specific case of the Canaries, these costs are estimated to stand at around 8 percentage points for large undertakings, 9% for the SMEs, and even reaching 29% for tobacco production. This situation forces us to draw a conclusion of paramount importance, which is the following: instead of being harmful to free competition, the tax measures proposed by the Commission are designed to level out conditions for competition. This is the only way we will be able to guarantee genuine equality of opportunity for Canarian industrial operators or, rather, for some of them, provided that the tax measures proposed are not universal and systematic.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we are discussing the appropriate instrument with which to respond to the specific needs of the Canaries as an outermost region and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism expressed the same view when it approved my report by overwhelming majority. If the European Parliament is to be consistent with its previous positions demonstrating clear solidarity and support for the outermost regions, it must deliver a favourable opinion on the Commission proposal we are now discussing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not agree with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and, in the opinion I drafted, we proposed that these tax differentials<span class="italic"> </span>be scaled down from 25% to 15% and 15% to 10% respectively. I regret the fact that the lead Committee on Regional Policy has not followed us in this. As regards the products listed in the various categories, various inconsistencies are apparent, which have been pointed out in the many comments I have had from Spanish producers and also from Members of this House, and I would like to point them out to Mr Bolkestein, who is, after all, such a great defender of the principle that there should be no market distortions in the common market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I have to say to you. Category B includes rum, which, as we all know, is made from sugar cane. There are no sugar cane plantations in the Canary Islands, and the product, already distilled, is imported from abroad. The two dominant local manufacturers control 73% of the market and add aromatic substances and colourings to what they import from South Africa, selling the concoction as ‘rum from the Canary Islands’. So one cannot speak in terms of rum production in the Canary Islands supposedly maintaining jobs; there may well be a hundred jobs, but two families with an oligopoly of the Canary Islands market reap an immense profit from them. That is something of which you should take account.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to point out that there are a few other inconsistencies, for example, the levying of the new tax on gin, vodka and liqueurs, but not on whisky or other spirits. Make of that what you will. I suggest to you, Mr Bolkestein, that you take a good look at what you or your department have wrought there, and then you will see why we feel like giving you a clip round the ear when you keep coming back to us and telling us about inconsistencies!</p>

<p class="contents">Perhaps I should begin by reassuring Mrs Lulling – reassuring her and clarifying things a little for her, because last week I was in Luxembourg, Mrs Lulling’s own country, right in the middle of the European Union. In fact, the problem they have in Luxembourg today, as I could see last week, is that the country has too much economic activity, which is attracting hundreds of thousands of workers to work there.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the outermost regions of the Community is completely different. We are, one might say, the other side of the coin to Luxembourg. Any economic activity we perform has to overcome the enormous obstacle of distance. At the moment, therefore, it is quite impossible for any industrial company to set itself up in the Canary Islands to compete within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We had developed a small industrial sector on the basis of some rules which are certainly quite ancient, going back to the time when the Canary Islands were brought under the Crown of Castile, before Spain existed. There is a fifteenth-century Royal Charter by the Catholic Monarchs exempting traders in the Canary Islands from paying a number of taxes, and this has continued over the centuries. The Spanish constitution recognises it. When Spain joined the European Community, the Spanish Government took care to include some special provisions in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community to guarantee this special regime, and there is a protocol on this, which was amended by a Council decision in 1991 to adapt it to the internal market. I would say that the special regime for the Canary Islands compared with the rest of the Community territory is less special now than at any time in the whole history of our country and the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have done is to replace old forms of taxation, which were much more restrictive, like the APIM (Tax on Production and Imports) or the special tariff, with some new forms of taxation which conflict much less with the operation of the internal market. In other words, what the Commission is proposing and I hope the Council will approve is to try to reduce the impact on trade. In this way, the measures we are adopting now are measures that will facilitate trade within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lulling may be right in some respect; I do not deny it. That is, I would say we have now had a first go, a first attempt at outlining what this neutral tax system will be, allowing trade to function but with a slight preference so as to be able to maintain traditional activities.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mrs Lulling looks, for instance, at the amendments approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – Amendment No 10 to Article 2 and Amendment No 11 to Article 3 – she will see that there are some adaptation mechanisms, so that the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, can review the conditions and adjust the rates and other situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, I am aware that the same concerns voiced by Mrs Lulling have also been voiced specifically at a local level by economic and political actors. This means that, once the Council approves the system, we shall have the opportunity to go on reviewing and adapting it in order to achieve the objective of the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a matter of putting up insurmountable barriers but of letting some small, traditional activities continue, and that explains why there is, if you like, a certain discrimination. That is, products are included according to whether there are economic activities that have to be kept going. It is not a question of developing new economic activities but in practice of keeping existing ones going. Of course, I agree with Mrs Lulling that there may be differences, but we shall have to look at these differences a little later.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, I believe the objective for the Spanish Government in making the proposals and for the Commission is to liberalise the internal market and to facilitate the integration of this region – so distant and facing so many difficulties – into the rest of the internal market. It must also be remembered that there is not even such a thing as a Canary Islands market, because there are seven islands and each island has a market, with its own obstacles. In other words, it may be much easier to export from Luxembourg to Gran Canaria than from Tenerife to Gran Canaria, unless these small differences are established.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that tomorrow this House will approve the proposal as formulated by the Committee on Regional Policy, and the Socialist Group is, of course, against the amendments tabled by Mr Helmer, which attempt to demolish or weaken a system which I believe has now been precisely calculated to prevent these businesses or occupations from disappearing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the Commission and its staff for their efforts and, of course, I am grateful to Mr Marques for the work he has done in presenting this report to us.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to fisheries, the proposal affects fresh and chilled fish belonging to certain species such as sea bream, hake and sea bass, as well as smoked fish and salmon.</p>
<p class="contents">The exemptions authorised – as those who have spoken before me have pointed out – must form part of a strategy for the economic and social development of the Canary Islands and thus contribute to the promotion and diversification of local activities. These tax measures are exceptional, specific and designed to compensate for the disadvantages suffered by the islands as an outermost region and are therefore fully covered by Article 299(2) of the Treaty. This is a legal basis which is aimed at allowing the local economic activities of the outermost regions to compete, despite the considerable disadvantages of their insularity and isolation and the small size of their local market. It is a legal framework that is not limited to this type of tax measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of fisheries, now that the common fisheries policy is to be reformed, for instance, the specific conditions deriving from their nature as outermost regions must be taken into consideration in the framework of Article 299(2), as indicated by the proposal which the committee itself has already adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I congratulate him because he has produced an excellent report responding to a demand from the Canary Islands – one of the outermost regions of the Union that has some specific tax features, supported on a sound legal basis (Article 299(2) of the Treaty). I thank him because, through his excellent work and his flexibility, he has managed to gather a solid parliamentary majority around him which makes it seem likely that the report will be approved within the next few hours, which will put an end to a long parliamentary journey that began almost two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and fiscal regime of the islands is the backbone of the statute of autonomy and self-government of the Canary Islands, the current version of which derives from the Treaty on European Union and Spain’s Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, although over the centuries – ever since we were brought under the Crown of Castile, even before Castile was Spain – it has often been modified to suit the circumstances of the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is therefore about certain historical rights, which are no lower in status than the fiscal peculiarities of Luxembourg or some of the British Isles, to mention only the case of countries where these measures have come up against some stiff opposition, paradoxical though it may seem. Those Members who have tried – and are still trying – to change the rapporteur’s text with their amendments are upholding legitimate interests – there is no doubt of that – but interests linked especially to the tobacco, alcoholic beverage and spirits lobbies, which do not now coincide with the interests of the Canary Islanders, the vast majority of whom have, through their legitimate representatives, declared their position along the lines of the Marques report. Just as the Spanish Government has done, by virtue of its Constitution, just as the European Commission is doing – it has seen that this project is valid and does not run counter to Community law – and as is reflected by the broad agreement within the Council, which may well approve it in a few days’ time, once Parliament has pronounced on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Canary Islands will thus have a good economic policy instrument, which will allow them to diversify their resources and enhance their economic and social development, stop the decline of their already weak industrial sector and, if possible, stimulate its growth, especially in the food processing sector. If this happens, it will help retain jobs and create new ones in a region of high unemployment, while offering alternatives to the islands’ risky dependence on the tourist industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Canary Islands cannot continue to grow just on the basis of receiving a few hundred thousand more tourists every year. This year we will have had twelve million visitors; this brings benefits, of course, but it also has sometimes devastating effects on our sustainable development: on some islands the annual number of tourists far outweighs the total number of permanent residents, generating a number of problems. These will only increase in future if we do not step in to correct this trend, which is what this regulation aims to do.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons and others mentioned by the rapporteur and some of the speakers, this report must be approved and, as a member of the European People’s Party, that is what I hope will happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to welcome our fellow Members from the Canaries who are present and say that, speaking on behalf of the Azores, we stand shoulder to shoulder with you and that we fully support your objectives of achieving the most balanced possible form of development for the Canaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing we must understand: what we have here are not proposals for tax exemptions for some rich countries at the centre of Europe, such as Luxembourg, for example, which would seriously undermine the balance of the internal market, which would create economic imbalances, and even a concentration of economic activity that in fact benefits no one. What we have here are one-off measures intended to support industries and small-scale activities which would otherwise not survive. We cannot compare the survival of small rum producers in the Canaries with the situation of sugar in the European Union, which is a cartel providing massive profits for a industry that is highly protected and which the Commission is not able – or willing – to end. In fact, it is doing the opposite. We saw proof of this here only yesterday. I therefore call on all my fellow Members resolutely to support the proposal submitted by Sérgio Marques. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, it replaces another no less categorical tax, the APIM. As an outermost region of the European Union, the Canary Islands have seen a review of their model of integration into our European Community, which led to the APIM falling apart when certain basic products or goods were imported, resulting in job losses in the Canary Islands’ industrial sector and a fall in the export of local products.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission, in collaboration with the competent authorities, has therefore put forward a proposal for a decision on special fiscal measures designed to correct the costs of being an outermost region.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most important fact from a political viewpoint is, I believe, that the Commission has, to this end, taken Article 299(2) of the Treaty as the legal basis for implementing a temporary and proportional derogation from Articles 23, 25 and 90 when applying the Community provisions that allow the Spanish authorities to discriminate in fiscal terms regarding certain Canary Island products.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence our congratulations to the Commission, the rapporteur, Mr Marques, and also Mr Casaca for his support. We hope the Council – and Parliament – will be receptive towards this proposal, because amongst other things this tax is recognition of the Canary Islands’ fiscal regime, and it is also coherent with the economic diversification strategy drawn up by the European Union for the outermost regions and prevents job losses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Had it not been for the initiative of one of my colleagues, Mr Helmer, in overturning that procedure, this House would not have had the opportunity to discuss it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it very clear to the House at the outset that, recognising their ultra-peripheral status, I have no problem with special treatment for the Canary Islands, – my goodness, I would quite like it for my own region, but that is not very likely. This was accepted at the time of Spain's accession to the European Union and special tax arrangements were put in place to assist local industries. But those derogations from the rules of the single market were intended to be temporary and to be phased out. Far from phasing out these measures, the Commission's proposal effectively doubles the level of protection for a wide range of goods, impacting especially heavily on spirits and tobacco. The large tourist industry of the Canary Islands is an important outlet for these products.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed measures will impact negatively on liquor and cigarette manufacturers in many Member States. By raising consumer prices in the Canaries they may even damage the island's tourist trade. In particular they will damage Gallaghers in my own constituency and Imperial Tobacco in Nottingham, to name but two. Bizarrely, as I understand it, the proposals will protect an American cigarette manufacturer in the Canaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur says that jobs have been lost in cigarette factories in the Canaries, but they have also been lost in cigarette factories across the European Union. With changes in consumption and improvements in productivity, we all have industries in our own regions that suffer from overseas competition, but in the single market we do not raise protectionist taxes. The original intention was to phase out these measures. The Commission's proposal is to double them. I put it to the House that a reasonable compromise is to leave the levels as they were in 2001, and I call on colleagues to support the amendments to this effect and reject the Commission's proposed increases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this important matter. I shall begin by saying that this Commission proposal represents the implementation, in the tax field, of Article 299(2) of the Treaty. That article recognises the specific nature of the outermost regions, which include the Canary Islands, and it provides for specific measures to be adopted, particularly in taxation, to take into account the special characteristics and constraints of those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of a memorandum and notifications from Spain, the Commission proposed a Community framework for a tax known as "<span class="italic">Arbitrio sobre las Importaciones y Entregas de Mercancías en las islas Canarias</span>", or the AIEM tax, which would apply to the Canary Islands from 1 January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been remarked by many Members of this Parliament, a number of handicaps affecting local manufacturing firms were identified, and this justifies the introduction of a specific measure to encourage industrial production and increase its share in the Canary Islands' gross domestic product through exemption or rates reductions granted to local products. For that reason a Community framework has been proposed which selectively authorises maximum tax rates of 5% and 15% for various sensitive products to which Spain may apply exemptions in the light of the need to promote local production activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The rates applicable to tobacco products is fixed at 25% because local production of tobacco products has significantly diminished in the Canary Islands in recent years. Mr Nicholson referred to the exemption, or, rather, the maximum rate applicable to tobacco products; it was 15% in the past; 25% is now proposed. Local production is still being lost, so there does not appear to be a link between the lower tariff that has been applied in the past and the level of local production.</p>
<p class="contents">The rates and exemptions contained in the Community framework must be seen as options subject to ceilings which the national and regional authorities may use in combination with the support needed for local production. This decision is to be applied for a period of ten years. It will nevertheless be necessary to evaluate the proposed system after five years. An evaluation is therefore to be made of the arrangements and, if necessary, the decision can be adapted on the basis of this evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased that this proposal has been welcomed by the European Parliament. I would in particular like to welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Marques, as well as the opinions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Fisheries. Examination of this proposal is ongoing in the Council, and the Commission very much wants to address this issue in a timely manner. The most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not to formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to endeavour to take them on board as far as possible with a view to adoption of the proposal by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies to Amendment No 1, which proposes to introduce a reference to the Commission report of March 2000 on the measures to implement Article 299(2) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This also applies to Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9, which propose basing the European framework of this AIEM tax on the limitation of maximum exemptions instead of the tax itself, Amendment No 8, proposing introduction of a recital to justify the date of application of the proposals, and Amendments Nos 10, 12, 13 and 14, which are purely formal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission does not agree with Amendments 7 and 11, which allow the extension of the list of products concerned by the fiscal exemptions under a comitology procedure. Since those exemptions constitute fiscal discrimination, the content of such provisions must be decided by the Council itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 15, 16, 17 and 18, which were introduced at a late stage, propose rates of 5% and 10% for products and 15% for tobacco and are not acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The 5%, 15% and 25% rates proposed by the Commission correspond globally to the rates allowed under the previous regime, the purpose being to focus on the products for which the measures are most needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to reply to some of the comments made this evening. First of all, I agree with Mr Medina Ortega, who said that the AIEM equals the APIM plus the special tariff. These two latter taxes were amalgamated in the 1991 regulation, so once again I agree with the analysis, which was shared by Mr Sánchez García. Both Members of Parliament have the Commission on their side as regards that analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fernández Martín then said that maintaining local industry maintains local employment and activities other than tourism. Of course, he is right and the Commission would like to express its agreement with that statement.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already replied to Mr Nicholson on tobacco products, stating that local production is decreasing in spite of the fiscal advantages. That apparently ensued from Amendments Nos 16 to 19 put forward by Mr Helmer. The reduction of the exemptions is not acceptable to the Commission since it would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I was struck by the vivacious nature of the comments, questions and remarks by Mrs Lulling. I can assure her in the case of rum that there is indeed traditional local production. I can testify to that myself, having been at various times to the Canary Islands. I have even seen the plants. If Mrs Lulling does not believe me, I suggest that the two of us visit the Canary Islands and look at the plants and on our trip we can also discuss the possibility of excise taxes on wine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask him to tell me which exemptions and derogations he is talking about and specify each one. He cannot just bandy about gratuitous accusations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the speakers who took the floor wish to protect the small activities in the Canary Islands. I would, however, be tempted to agree with Mr Bolkestein’s plans to control these small activities, in particular with regard to rum. People have approached me, Spaniards in particular, to say that there are no sugar cane plantations in the Canary Islands, that the raw materials are imported from South Africa, that Spanish rum-producing companies are equally guilty of discrimination. What is more, I can name two companies, Areucas and Artemi, which share 73% of the rum market in the Canary Islands, and I am sorry, Mr Bolkestein, but there are indeed distortions of competition. We shall meet again and we shall see who is right: whether it is I or he, he who so badly wants to eliminate distortions in competition within the single market. We shall talk about this again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
