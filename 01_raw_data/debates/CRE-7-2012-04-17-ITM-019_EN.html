This is the first time that Parliament has had an opportunity to evaluate these talks and give the Commissioner and the whole Commission feedback.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan is an important partner for the EU and its Member States. It supplies EU countries with energy, and other products too, of course; but it is especially important for us as far as energy security is concerned. The benefits are obviously mutual, which is why these negotiations are being held. Let us also hope that the association agreements will bring stability and, at some stage, even eventual peace in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">These talks have obviously been overshadowed by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Unfortunately, association agreement negotiations will not be able to find a solution to the greatest cause of instability in the region. That is the task of the Minsk Group. Let us hope that our negotiations do not in any way cause problems for those talks. I do not suppose that that will be the case, anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the work of the Minsk Group accelerated. In recent times, it has come up with hardly anything. Of course, it has to be admitted that the parties in the dispute, Armenia and Azerbaijan, need to show greater political will, to achieve a peace agreement between the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the subjects being discussed during these negotiations include not only energy and economic issues, but many others as well. Human rights have a very essential role. The economy cannot be developed, and neither can cooperation, unless human rights are acknowledged and respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, in the matter of human rights, it has to be said that there are still major shortcomings. Even today, we have received news that people have been detained and house-to-house searches have been carried out without a warrant of any kind. Neither Parliament nor the Commission is able or willing to close its eyes to violations of this kind. We require Azerbaijan, which is a member of the Council of Europe, to comply with the human rights agreements to which it has committed itself. It still has much to do in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurovision Song Contest in Baku is another poignant issue, to some extent. It is an honour for Azerbaijan. Like all the other countries that have won the competition, Azerbaijan wants to do the job honourably. It has been proposed, however, that the contest should be boycotted. I myself am not in favour of that. I visited a school and asked young people what their opinion was of that, without saying what I myself thought. They wondered why we should boycott the competition if we wanted to hold the association agreement negotiations and work together.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to focus attention on human rights. I hope that youth and student exchange programmes will be something in which the EU will invest. In the very same way that Azerbaijan itself has ... </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tomasz Piotr Poręba, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(PL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on Armenia that I prepared in the European Parliament is, in my view and in that of my political group, a significant and important report. Why is this the case? The reason is that we believe that all countries in the Southern Caucasus, including Armenia, would be more secure if they were closer to Europe, if they cooperated more with the European Union, and if they introduced European standards in their own countries. They would be safer not just from the point of view of the countries themselves, but also from the point of view of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">While preparing this report, I visited Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, where I had meetings with authorities from both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia in order to obtain information on the ground in Armenia about relations between the countries in this region and to learn about the views of the Armenian authorities as regards the political situation in the area. It was important to me that the report that you have in front of you, which we are now debating and on which we will be voting tomorrow, should be completely objective and should present the whole complex situation in this region as well as a complete background to the conflict. It was also important that it should point to some optimistic objectives and that it should contain optimistic information showing that there is a possibility – sooner or later, depending on the authorities in that country – of better and more effective cooperation between Armenia and the European Union. Why is this important? It is important because the association agreement negotiations with Armenia that began in 2010 are making good progress. Since that time, 24 chapters have been closed and it would appear that at present, there are no issues that would bring about any untoward extensions to these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, Armenia prepared a comprehensive reform strategy and then presented it for assessment by the European Commission, together with a request for support. As far as I know, Commissioner Štefan Füle and Prime Minister Sargsyan are currently working on a joint programme to improve and implement this strategy. We are counting on the European Parliament being kept informed on an ongoing basis about the progress being made in this work. There is no doubt that the Armenian authorities are facing many challenges and some painful reforms. It was very important to me that the report focused both on those areas where significant improvements had already been made, as far as the internal situation in Armenia is concerned, as well as on areas such as human rights or press freedom in its broadest sense, where improvements are being made but where more still needs to be done. It is only by doing this that good relations and a rapid conclusion to the negotiations with the European Union can be guaranteed. Recognition should certainly be given to the support provided by the Armenian authorities to the office for the protection of human rights, which enjoys considerable independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the issue of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is obvious to anyone who follows the situation in the Southern Caucasus. It is discussed in both reports, both in mine and in that of Anneli Jäätteenmäki. Parliament has emphasised the need to comply with the guidelines set out by the OSCE Minsk Group in its joint declaration of 10 July 2009 and has linked negotiations for association agreements with Azerbaijan and Armenia with reliable undertakings aimed at ending the conflict. For me, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that we, as the European Parliament, will not resolve this conflict and we will not be able to solve this problem. Everything depends on the two countries, on how they develop their relations. However, we here in the European Parliament ... </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to report on the progress made in the negotiations on the association agreements between the European Union and Armenia and Azerbaijan respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the interest and engagement demonstrated by the European Parliament in this regard. We have had an intensive and regular exchange with the two rapporteurs to prepare the two well-structured and comprehensive reports, for which I would like to thank Ms Jäätteenmäki and Mr Poręba.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of these reports comes at a moment when the relations of the European Union with the South Caucasus and, in particular, with Armenia and Azerbaijan, are under the spotlight. During the visit of the Armenian President Sargsyan to Brussels in March, and when I visited Baku to attend the Euronest plenary session two weeks ago, I conveyed two key messages to our interlocutors: first, our readiness to strengthen our links and to provide support, and second, our wish to see tangible progress on a number of issues, including deepened democracy, respect for human rights and conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Before providing comments on the reports, let me briefly give an update on the negotiations. There has been considerable progress since they were launched in July 2010. We had eight plenary meetings with Armenia, and five with Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of 28 chapters on sectoral and economic reform, we closed 24 chapters with Armenia and 13 with Azerbaijan. Discussions on the political as well as the justice, freedom and security chapters are well advanced, in particular, with Armenia. Let me also stress that we perceived a genuine commitment of our interlocutors to fruitful – although at times difficult – negotiations, and this is reflected in the number of chapters closed so far.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the reports, I would like to say from the outset that we fully share the views of the rapporteurs that the association agreements currently under negotiation are fundamental and far-reaching tools for deepening our relations with the two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the multilateral dimension of the Eastern Partnership, these agreements should also be instrumental in developing, in a regional context, a series of bilateral contacts between the two countries in a number of areas. At present, such contacts between Armenia and Azerbaijan are almost non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also share with you my impressions on the two issues addressed in detail in the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on Nagorno-Karabakh, the European Union has recently expressed its concern at the slow progress in the peace negotiations and it called on both Armenia and Azerbaijan to step up their efforts to reach agreement on the ‘Madrid principles’ as a basis for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased tensions along the front lines add further concerns. We therefore urge the leaders on both sides to fully implement all commitments made in the Minsk Group framework. The European Union stands ready to continue to provide enhanced support for confidence-building measures and this will remain complementary to the Minsk Group framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has the capacities and experience to contribute to confidence-building measures on people-to-people contacts and on security. The European Union could also contribute to a number of initiatives, such as the mechanism proposed by the OSCE to investigate incidents along the lines of contact. We have underlined the need for unconditional/unrestricted access for European Union representatives to Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions. We continue to work on this with the Armenian and Azerbaijani leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is the issue of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. Armenia and Azerbaijan are committed to sharing values and principles with the European Union in this field and we should make every effort to stress to them the need to ensure that their countries fully comply with these standards.</p>
<p class="contents">An important test for Armenia will be the upcoming parliamentary elections in May and the presidential election next year. In the case of Azerbaijan, the European Union has clearly expressed the need for progress in democratic reforms in a number of areas. We also called for an invitation to be extended to the rapporteur for political prisoners of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our level of ambition is high in this exercise: on what we can offer, but also on what we expect from our partners. This is where the ‘more for more’ principle will fully apply.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me once again congratulate the rapporteurs for their reports, as well as the European Parliament for the interest and attention you have shown in these two countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Occupying territories and preventing refugees and internally displaced persons from returning to their homes is against European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Some believe that negotiations within the framework of the Minsk basic principles would bring an agreement to resolve this problem. In my view, the negotiations were not robust enough and did not bring the expected results. We will have to agree to disagree on the results of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I believe that the European Union should take a more active role in the settlement of this conflict and call on Armenia to withdraw its forces from the occupied territories in Nagorno-Karabakh, along with confidence-building measures and multinational peacekeeping operations. This is why I insist and reiterate that the Union should be involved in the negotiations using the experience of its Member States, and I also refer to the experience of the Baltic countries in the 1990s when it comes to holding – or not – a possible referendum in future.</p>
<p class="contents">On visa facilitation, I welcome the launch in March of the negotiations on the visa facilitation and readmission agreement, but our cooperation on mobility should go further. Once all the conditions are met we should aim for visa liberalisation. People-to-people contact is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan still has many challenges ahead, especially with regard to the judiciary, to the fight against corruption and organised crime, and, in particular, to implementing international law on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Many things are to be done and I would recommend focusing on high-level corruption cases, which are the test for both judges and politicians, and on improving transparency of public income and expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the short time that has elapsed, we could perhaps not only criticise but also commend the Balkan countries. But before that, Commissioner, I would like to commend you on your firm and credible approach to the two countries. First of all, we should welcome the efforts made by Armenia to reform its legislation. The aim of helping the most free and fair elections ever also deserves respect. On 6 May 2012, we shall see to what extent this ambition has turned into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress in the negotiations on the association agreement only shows how much Armenia is set on improving its relations with the EU. Azerbaijan is also showing signs that its relations with the EU are becoming a priority. The country is emerging as a strong ally with a growing strategic importance, not only in terms of energy, but also in terms of foreign policy and security. Keep up the good work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also includes implementing confidence-building measures such as general demilitarisation and a mechanism for active incident-prevention, and providing international security guarantees through the European Union’s direct and more active participation in the Minsk Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Substantial progress has been made between the European Union and Azerbaijan on energy cooperation, where Azerbaijan is one of the EU’s main partners in safeguarding Europe’s energy security. Technical assistance must be provided in order to help Azerbaijan diversify its economy and bring the country into line with the European Union’s climate change objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the call to the Council, Commission and European External Action Service to include in the association agreement clauses and criteria on the protection of human rights, especially with respect to media freedom and the right to free speech and association, which reflect the principles enshrined in the constitutions of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the highest European and international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Support must also be given to the efforts aimed at Azerbaijan’s accession to the World Trade Organisation by providing the technical assistance necessary to prepare for the negotiations, and it needs to be encouraged to adopt the reforms demanded. This will enable Azerbaijan and Armenia – at the end of a reform process lasting many years – to gain access to the European internal market, which will contribute to boosting their imports and increasing investments, and will help their sustainable growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, Armenia has made progress in democratisation, media freedom and human rights following the problems in the aftermath of the 2008 elections. However, we would expect the Armenians to make gestures on giving back the surrounding occupied territories, regardless of the ongoing negotiations with Nagorno-Karabakh. That would be an important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that we agreed in the report to criticise both countries for the military build-up that is going on, as well as to urge both countries to sign and ratify the conventions against landmines and cluster munitions. I am especially glad that five major groups in this House have succeeded in including a reference in tomorrow’s vote to evictions and house demolitions, some of which are occurring in relation to the upcoming Eurovision song contest in Baku at the end of May. I am also glad that this Parliament is expressing its support for human rights activists who want to use the Eurovision song contest to improve human rights and the democratic record in Azerbaijan.</p>

For this reason, it is even more important to strengthen our involvement in the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea Synergy. More funds, greater support and regional exchanges; this is just the beginning, and the culmination must be assistance in resolving the Karabakh conflict. The end of this conflict would provide a centre of stability for the entire region and would finally put a limit on Russian influence.

<p class="contents">Having both countries associated with the European Union, along with the relevant legal and political convergence, economic modernisation and good accountable governance, are extremely important, both for the European Union’s foreign policy and the region. Europe’s more tangible political presence in this neighbouring region can help economic progress, respect for human rights, the fight against corruption and the rule of law – areas in which both countries need to catch up to varying degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the unresolved conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh must not become a stumbling block for regional cooperation and hamper the deepening of the two countries’ relations with the European Union. Only a peaceful solution can be found to the conflict in accordance with international law and the Minsk Group agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Both countries must create mechanisms for building mutual trust and find communication channels with the help of the European Union and the international community. The European Union’s major role in the region compels us to be as careful and fair as possible in our assessments, so that our actions do not resemble those of a bull in a china shop, making matters worse instead of contributing to achieving a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I am expecting fair, transparent and democratic elections to be held on 6 May in Armenia, which will help the country’s European integration. I welcome the fact that our colleagues from the European Parliament are being sent as election observers.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge both countries once again to sign the Statute of the International Criminal Court.

<p class="contents">Since then, there has been some progress: negotiations on association agreements have started – as the reports point out – and a visa facilitation dialogue has been initiated, as has enhanced economic cooperation.

So far, the Union has played a modest role, initiating and funding confidence-building measures. At this stage, our Union can offer more, including participation in possible international peacekeeping missions and playing a leading role in the post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of the conflict-affected areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Armenia and Azerbaijan are countries with which we have enjoyed, and shall continue to enjoy, significant cooperation in various fields. It is consequently even more important that democracy should develop in the Caucasus region and that we should have close trading links with these countries and continued success with the energy projects we have undertaken, such as the Trans-Caspian pipeline, which opens up exceptionally broad opportunities for securing energy independence for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the most difficult issue in these countries’ bilateral relations is, of course, that of Nagorno-Karabakh, which also came to the fore during the Euronest meeting in Baku, in which I took part. This conflict is a very complex issue. Its solution is achievable gradually, step by step, adhering strictly at all times to international standards and, above all, territorial integrity. First of all, occupying forces must be withdrawn from the occupied territories of Nagorno-Karabakh, the use of force must cease, and genuine international peacekeeping forces must be established. They will have to ensure peace and safely return internally displaced persons and refugees to their homes. We must then conceive of measures to promote mutual trust between the peoples living in this territory.</p>

If we want to finally achieve an end to the twenty-year occupation, we must also very clearly and unambiguously say these words – the key lies in Moscow. Secondly, I would like to say that the amendments to reports that were voted in refer very clearly to the fact that Armenia cannot sign the association agreement before it has withdrawn its troops from Azerbaijani territory; in other words, before it has ceased to occupy Azerbaijani territories.

Gradual steps to strengthen democracy and efforts to improve the situation of minorities in society give hope that both of these post-Soviet countries have the necessary potential for a closer partnership with the European Union. It is still risky to predict the future development of the Azerbaijani region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been under Armenian occupation for 20 years now, with all the associated consequences for more than one million Azerbaijani refugees, and for the population of the Nakhchivan region who, as a result of the occupation, have lost direct contact with their country. Therefore, negotiations on association agreements should be based on Minsk Group documents, with strong commitments by both countries to a civilised and peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem that places an emphasis, first and foremost, on the needs and interests of its population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are of significant strategic importance for other reasons.

<p class="contents">Therefore, all aspects of the results produced by the Minsk Group are very important, including the right to self-determination. I believe that both sides must take a constructive approach to these issues in order to guarantee that this is the case. Both sides must stop their military build-up if they want to promote democracy, the rule of law and economic development. The European Union could have a balanced relationship with the two countries by bringing about a settlement between them and by ensuring that it is able to talk to both sides. In this way, it could make the successful resolution of this frozen conflict into the crowning achievement of its neighbourhood policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The negotiations on association agreements with Eastern Partnership countries are making good progress. A few weeks ago, the first association agreement in the region – the one with Ukraine – was initialled. Four other negotiation processes are well under way, and we have recently decided to launch the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement component with three countries. We stand ready to consider taking a similar decision on Azerbaijan as soon as it joins the World Trade Organisation, and we are indeed ready to assist in any way we can.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I agree with you that the European Union has a number of core interests in Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as in the region at large. I also agree with those of you who made the point that this is not about the competition between those two countries, nor is it about the debate on who is – or who is not – more important. All partners – large or small – are important to me and to my colleagues, and should be important to the European Union. These interests relate, in particular, to security and stability. Democratic reforms, energy and investments – those are the core interests we have in that region. I believe that the association agreements, once in force, will be one of our most effective and valuable tools in promoting a number of core European Union values, as well as in promoting economic integration and enhancing the mobility of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am glad to see that the European Parliament has also played an active role in closely monitoring the situation in the South Caucasus and, in particular, I am glad to see the progress that has been made in the negotiation of the association agreements. In recent months, you have adopted reports on the negotiations with Moldova and Georgia, and today on the negotiations with two additional countries. All included valuable recommendations and reflect the strong interest of the European Parliament in the implementation of the decisions of the Prague and Warsaw Eastern Partnership summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me assure you that I am committed to engagement. I am committed to progress that is beneficial to the people on the ground. The vacuum is what I will continue to fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The South Caucasus region is evolving as a result of debate and cooperation. It is becoming safer, and human rights are beginning to be respected there. It has been mentioned here, and I myself would also like to stress the fact, that Azerbaijan has been independent for 20 years. There have been improvements during those 20 years, but it is a short time in which to change an entire political system, a whole way of thinking and attitudes to human rights. That takes time and calls for cooperation: it needs the EU to emphasise the importance of human rights and democracy and to insist on improvements in these areas during the negotiations. In this way, the agreement will be established and people’s circumstances will improve and be made more stable, and, hopefully, peace will eventually be achieved. The requirement for any development is that the country’s tax revenues can be used constructively, in order to improve life on an everyday basis, and not for buying military technology and continuing a spiralling build-up of arms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the co-rapporteurs for their help, constructive comments and amendments as well as for a straightforward and rational dialogue concerning these reports. After hearing all the interventions during today’s debate, I would like to say that there is a common thread that links them all: we are all saying and emphasising the fact that the European Union should strengthen its relations with the Southern Caucasus, that the EU should have a greater presence there and that it should show greater determination in building good relations with the countries in the Southern Caucasus region. I believe that these reports will be helpful in building good relations and good contacts with the Southern Caucasus and that this will be advantageous both for the countries in that region and for the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly from my point of view, as the rapporteur of this report on Armenia, the upcoming elections on 6 May will constitute a real test of the Armenian authorities – a test of their will, desire, ambition and determination to create good relations with the European Union. If these elections are free, transparent and fair – and I believe they will be – this would be an important sign that this country really is taking its obligations seriously, obligations aimed at an association agreement, which would serve the interests of both the European Union and Armenia, being signed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank you for the assistance provided during the preparation of the report.

Armenia is a good example of this. This country, with a history reaching back to ancient times, is one of the most distant centres of European culture and civilisation. For this reason, an association agreement between the European Union and Armenia seems to be a natural process to strengthen bilateral relations. The difficult and tangled nature of the region’s history, with many tragic undertones, should not affect the vision that we have for future cooperation. Instead of criticising – where the criticism often stems from a failure to understand ethnic and historical interdependence in the Caucasus – the European Union should focus on providing multilateral assistance to Armenia so that this country can, in the foreseeable future, implement European standards that will enable it to form an association with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The right way to achieve this objective is to increase active participation by Armenia in multilateral parliamentary cooperation as part of the Euronest Assembly. This would be a good example of involvement in European values and principles, which are shared by most of Armenian society. The announcements by the Armenian authorities of democratic, transparent and free elections that are to take place there in May of this year should be treated as a gesture of goodwill and an expression of that country’s European ambitions. Union authorities should be tasked with strengthening this attitude and showing that decisions are being taken and challenges are being overcome that are bringing the goal, which is to return Armenia to the European fold, ever closer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation is so tense that, from the beginning of March, there has been a concentration of Russian forces on the Azeri frontier.

We should go to even greater lengths to become involved in this dialogue, to convince both sides of the need for an armistice.
