<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, the regions of Oene, Kootwijkerbroek, Mayenne, Cumbria and Northumberland have become notorious in Europe. Regions where humans and animals have suffered from the foot-and-mouth epidemic. However, the suffering was caused not only by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, but also by the means of combating the disease imposed by EU regulations, namely the slaughter of all animals on infected farms and in a buffer zone around them. An approach based solely on the preservation of distant export markets. Odd, if we realise that the European Union actually imports meat from vaccinated cattle from Argentina.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the suffering of the last few months would have been unnecessary if the Commission had been prepared to accept preventive vaccination. In France and since June also in the Netherlands the crisis has been averted. Unfortunately, that is not yet the case in the United Kingdom. There the suffering of farmers and animals continues unabated. The figures make our heads spin. Since 9 a.m. this morning, there have been 2 005 new cases. Twenty recent new cases in Northumberland that for three months had seen no new infections. In the United Kingdom, four million animals have been destroyed in connection with foot-and-mouth disease and a further one-and-a-half million because of welfare problems related to the crisis. Let me be clear about this. This is not a loss of production units. This is the destruction of living creatures. It surprises me that the British government is only now considering using vaccination. The argument that they wish to retain the lucrative export markets no longer cuts any ice, now that winter is nearly upon us. Under the present circumstances, the United Kingdom will have lost that market for a considerable time.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the British government will listen to Sir William Stewart of the British Association of Science who says that vaccination must play a part in combating foot-and-mouth disease and should have been used at a much earlier stage. There is intensive contact with continental Europe through the many movements of people, animals, vehicles and lorries. That makes the situation in the United Kingdom life-threatening for agriculture in Europe. The present checks, including those at the Dutch border, are so minimal that they are asking for trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to take adequate preventive steps to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in continental Europe, so that humans and animals are spared unnecessary suffering. Finally, I appeal urgently to the Commission once again in the light of the unmanageable crisis in the United Kingdom to change the non-vaccination policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martinez (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, in this outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, there are technical areas of shadow, political certainties and strategic questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all regarding the areas of shadow, how, far from the known endemic sources – Turkey, Asia and Thrace in Europe – how has foot-and-mouth disease, and its virus, managed to reach Great Britain, an island? Perhaps by swimming? Why this dogmatic refusal of a vaccine that is nevertheless effective. In 1950, before the obligatory vaccination between 1961 and 1991, France had up to 300 000 sources of infection per year, which disappeared with the obligatory vaccination. Why, in the same country, have we had the foot-and-mouth virus and the prion for mad cow disease?</p>
<p class="contents">So many questions that lead to political certainties, if not lessons. In both cases, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the British authorities have reacted late and have been overwhelmed, because the ultra liberalism of the Thatcher years left only 220 vets compared with 8 000 in France. Just as for a developing country, Australia, Canada and even the French army had to send vets to Great Britain. A lack of vets and no epidemic monitoring, which is why the disease spread. It was also ultra liberalism that led to abattoirs being closed and meant that, from Carlisle, Hadrian’s Wall and Northumberland, sheep are taken to the south and the virus is spread. The virus is spread across Great Britain and, following the removal of borders, it is also spread across France. Freedom of movement is freedom of contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">The third certainty, demonstrated in an investigation report from the French Parliament in June 2001: it was illegal purchases, at knock-down prices – less than 90 euros per sheep for the Muslim feast of Eid-el-Kabir – which led to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with these certainties, however, there are questions for the Commission; and it is good that it should be Mr Lamy, the strategist, who is here. First of all, does the compensation system in Great Britain not end up becoming a bonus for contamination? The impression was given that the beneficial compensation meant that people perhaps had an interest in having contaminated animals. All the more so given that, collectively, four million animals were slaughtered, the majority of which were sheep, means that the surpluses will be drained. And finally, does New Zealand, the leading world exporter, not have an interest in seeing its potential market share in Europe increase as animals are slaughtered? And my God, if Anglo-Saxons were able to come to an understanding on the Echelon Treaty, they can exchange favours. For me, Great Britain, excessive individual compensation, for you, New Zealand, the possibility of more exports. The Cairns group would be happy. Doha would be a success. It would be good if Mr Lamy could clarify this for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The great question is, and I do not know whether the Commission can answer it: what is the Commission’s explanation for the continued outbreaks of foot-and-mouth in the United Kingdom?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is not only a matter for the authorities in Great Britain itself. After all, every European taxpayer contributes to the solution of the crisis. Has the Commission urged Britain for example to use ring vaccination? I should have thought that the example in the Netherlands was very successful, and why could it not be repeated in other European countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Another question. One of the reasons for the crisis is that meat was imported illegally into Europe. Controls on our outer borders were inadequate. My question to the Commission is: what has been done since on the outer borders? What has changed from, let us say, some six months ago? Why not implement a similar type of check as in the United States or in Australia, where there are strict controls on entry? I have not been able to find this anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A further question. I believe that the large-scale slaughter of animals will no longer be acceptable to public opinion in the long run. The development of marker vaccines might be one of the solutions. The Commission has already done something about this, but will it do a little more to ensure that these marker vaccines and also the accompanying testing methods are made available as quickly as possible, so that we no longer have to slaughter so many animals?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should like to know something about the costs. The situation in Great Britain is special, since the whole question of rebate is taken into consideration, but how much does the Commission estimate that this has cost up to now? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a document here in front of me stating that the British government admits that it was unable to meet the required deadlines for the slaughter of infected animals. It goes on to say that the control of the disease, as my colleague there has said, has failed because we are now having new outbreaks in the centre of Britain, in the centre of the region where we thought we were rid of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have failed to control it and we have also failed to provide the necessary border controls. Last Sunday I drove from my farm in North Yorkshire to Strasbourg. I was never questioned about whether I was carrying any meat and there were no border controls at all to check my vehicle. There were no disinfection points. There was a simple carpet in the middle of the road and that was all.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Mr Lamy, who is the really important man here today, that we have a situation where England is the dustbin of Europe. We are importing food from these countries. We must look at that.</p>

The reason for our debate is, as the Joint Resolution says, that the measures taken by the UK government to control this disease have failed, that new outbreaks are appearing and that there is a very real risk of the disease spreading again to mainland Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ask ourselves why the UK government has failed and why in particular it consistently rejects the idea of ring vaccination in the face of mounting calls from those in rural communities who want to adopt it. It is ever more clear that it is not small farmers' livelihoods, it is not even the tourist industry and the wider rural economy that the UK has as its priority, but simply our meat exports and the desire to regain FMD-free export status again as soon as possible. Yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up. According to the National Farmers' Union the UK earns just GBP 630 million a year from meat and dairy exports. Compare that with the estimated cost to the wider rural community of GBP 9 billion as a result of the foot-and-mouth epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the call in this resolution for a full cost-benefit analysis between the various disease control approaches so that we can compare the losses that have been suffered under the culling approach to those that would have been incurred under a vaccination strategy. I feel sure that the results will demonstrate that the UK government’s approach is not only inhumane, it is also uneconomical. We are urging the Commission to revise the EU strategy on defending by all means FMD status and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret very much that we have been unable to agree a compromise text on this occasion. The reason is simple. Recital A accuses the UK government of failure to control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. In truth, it is not an attack on the UK government but on all those who have battled very heroically against the disease since the end of February – the farmers themselves, the vets, the scientists, the civil servants, the police, the military, many different rural agencies which have all been involved. In particular, the farmers in the Allendale Valley, the scene of the recent hotspot, believed that they had taken all the necessary measures to avoid the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure to control implies that the outbreak should have already ended. But the mover of the resolution did not explain when and by what means that might have been achieved. No-one ever promised, or even surmised, that the outbreak would be over at this stage. At its peak there were 40 to 50 cases a day. Despite the recent outbreak in Allendale, the average is now two or three cases per day. If this does not indicate a degree of control then we really have a very serious problem in front of us, something that none of us ever imagined.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important also to recall that from the very start the UK government has given full information to the other Member States and has followed the advice of the Standing Veterinary Committee. In that respect, we can point to a considerable success for the mechanisms that we have operating within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A word on vaccination. I would suggest to Mr van Dam, the original speaker on this resolution, that perhaps he ought to apply for the job of chief scientist in the United Kingdom. He certainly seems to bring to the debate on vaccination an authority and conviction which far exceeds that of the current holder of the office, Professor David King, who only this morning in a radio broadcast said we could not be certain that vaccination would have done any good. In the Netherlands the animals were also slaughtered and there is quite a problem here in the suggestion that vaccination actually saves the animal's life. That does not necessarily follow – but I do not know when the job becomes vacant! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the great success of the tackling of foot-and-mouth disease by the British government is causing many farmers in continental Europe sleepless nights once again. Is that a successful policy? Foot-and-mouth policy there is not only inadequate, because we do not use, for example, vaccination and ring vaccination but because the Council and members of Council are treating the threat from Great Britain extremely lightly. After all, it is extremely simple to lay disinfectant mats and carry out standard soil checks in ports and airports in order to clamp down on the problem. We emphatically appeal to the Commission and the Council on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in my country, financial subsidies to farmers are cut back drastically if they have made minor mistakes and have had foot-and-mouth disease. At the same time, however, many Ministers have no reason to talk, because they are doing nothing to avert the danger of foot-and-mouth disease from Great Britain in border checks. This is a very nasty business, which the Commission and Council must tackle.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, no one doubts the seriousness of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK. I believe it has been the worst epidemic of this disease that the world has seen. Nobody can doubt the drastic measures that have had to be used to curtail it.</p>
<p class="contents">The two current hotspots show that this outbreak will be with us for many months. We cannot, on the one hand, say that the containment is too drastic because of the slaughter policy and, on the other hand, that it is too slack because it has let the disease take hold. We did not anticipate effectively the extraordinary scale of animal movements, particularly of sheep, in February 2000 and later. The first of the three inquiries that have now been launched in the UK will need to look at that and perhaps also at the role of one form of CAP subsidy in encouraging some of these forms of animal movement. We provided effective information for our Dutch, French and Irish neighbours and for them it worked. We should study how their containment worked and why. Vaccination, in my opinion, has to be one of the options that the inquiry can recommend if they so find.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally a word to Mr Sturdy, who called for a European public inquiry. When we had one into BSE, he was not so enthusiastic. But BSE was a new disease. There was a real element of concealment in some of the factors that led to that disease and particularly in the European factor and the fact that we were still exporting infected meal to continental Europe for years after we banned it for ourselves. That was a genuine European inquiry. The epidemiology of this outbreak is not in doubt. I believe that our friends should accept that the British have to get their own house in order and, if that means a public dimension to the inquiries, that case can be made in the UK. It is not like what happened with BSE: we have done our duty by our neighbours. We hope that they will now have the confidence in us to let us help ourselves and see all remedies properly examined so that this dreadful disease can be exterminated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With millions of animals being slaughtered and farms being crippled or wiped out, this is hardly the time for party political argument. I well remember how Labour let fly at the Conservative government during the BSE crisis and now there is the temptation for the Conservatives to let fly at the Labour government, but even if governments are guilty of omission, what you are doing here is not exactly constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have submitted a regulation on feeding meat and bonemeal in certain cases – we are talking animal waste here. Had we had it at the time, there would have been no BSE problem. The same applies to foot-and-mouth. The Commission needs to change its strategy. Holland may have ring vaccinated successfully, but it was only by going against the mood in the EU and the Commission. I do not want you to help, I want you to do something so that we end up with a different strategy which we can then also secure through our trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must move away from this insane strategy of ‘foot-and-mouth free’ or ‘disease free’ and discuss this with our trading partners. We need a regulation on feeding or destroying leftovers. What the Council has done now, that is, just banning, is no help at all. This rubbish has to go somewhere and we cannot dump it in landfills because then the problem of improper processing will keep recurring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of cases of foot-and-mouth is on the rise once again. As you know, the foot-and-mouth virus is harmless to man but is highly infectious to all cloven-hoofed animals and results in huge financial losses. With new outbreaks occurring, I again call on the Commission and the Council to favour vaccination rather than slaughter. We must rethink how we fight zoonoses in Europe and today we have what I think is a very balanced resolution in order to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistent preventive hygiene is only one side of the coin. With people travelling the world for business and pleasure, foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present threat and we must be far more consistent in applying controls at airports to prevent this epidemic from coming in and spreading. I realise that both farmers and consumers are having difficulties with the ethical implications of the current vaccination policy. We are talking fatal consequences here. We must, at long last, move away from our non-vaccination policy. We need marker vaccines. We need a reasonable approach to ring vaccination and we need to make up our minds once and for all to show through our policy that science needs to make progress with prevention, that is, by formulating suitable vaccines.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>To give a brief description of the current situation in the Union as a whole, no restrictions have been imposed in the Union as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, except in Great Britain, and that was on 25 June this year, thirty days after the slaughter and destruction of the last vaccinated animal in the Netherlands. So in fourteen of the fifteen Member States of the Union, plus Northern Ireland, we have quite a favourable situation, which is the result of the implementation and effective application of measures to combat foot-and-mouth disease at Community level. I shall now run the risk of offending Mrs Lucas by referring briefly to the international point of view, and from that point of view we sincerely hope that the measures which have been adopted by France, Ireland and the Netherlands will enable them to obtain the necessary status from the International Office of Epizootics, thus enabling third countries to lift the trade restrictions that are still in place.</p>
<p class="contents">However – and on this point I should like to reassure Mrs Lucas – since this is perhaps not the most important aspect, let us come back to the case of the United Kingdom, which is actually still giving cause for concern, since the two-thousandth case occurred on 3 September. Although the situation in Great Britain has remained stable for almost three months, we are still worried about it because of the fact that cases are continuing to occur within or close to the areas that have been placed under restrictions. Many Members have referred to the most recent cases, in the county of Northumberland, the place where the epidemic first appeared. These cases are worrying, because they were confirmed three months after the disease had disappeared there. Radical measures were taken: infected herds were slaughtered, as were neighbouring herds and contact herds, and although the occurrence of this admittedly limited but nonetheless worrying number of cases was to be expected, after the disease peaked at the beginning of April, the period over which a small number of cases have continued to occur is excessively long, and the Community has asked the British authorities to step up their eradication measures. Time is pressing, because things will become more difficult in autumn and winter, not only because of weather conditions, but also because it is customary for animals to be moved during that period.</p>
<p class="contents">The present development of the disease is clearly passing through a critical phase. This is not the time to relax our controls. As has already been said, and as several of you have emphasised, this is the time of year when we see herds being moved around and handled in various ways, and in our opinion it is therefore necessary to reduce animal movements to the absolute minimum. The Commission has made this known to the people involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Staying with the United Kingdom, the complex structure of beef and dairy farming, the absence of any clinical signs in sheep, and the fact that the spread of the disease within a herd or flock is slow, are all factors which complicate the problems and which make it necessary for us to have recourse to laboratory testing, and the capacity available for such testing is now sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the Commission’s opinion? We would not say that the situation is satisfactory, because in this specific case it is not, but the risk of the disease spreading to other Member States is now much less than it was in March and April, when the disease was at its peak, because all the restrictions that were imposed, in particular on the movement of animals and untreated products from Great Britain, are still in place. We are carrying out regular on-the-spot inspections, the latest of which goes back to the end of August, in order to satisfy ourselves that the British authorities are taking adequate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Other regions of Great Britain, in some cases quite large regions, have not been affected by the disease, and the Veterinary Committee must continue to consider the matter so that when the time comes, and circumstances make it possible, trade with those regions can be envisaged subject to stringent conditions. On this point we shall be extremely careful, because the experience of Northumberland reminds us that the risk is still present, even in those areas where it seemed that the disease had been brought under control.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back for a moment to the question of third countries, if Mrs Lucas will allow me, a certain number of countries have continued to take discriminatory measures against European products, which go beyond the international standards currently in force, and we are working on this matter together with a certain number of our trading partners. Many third countries have gradually lifted the somewhat extensive prohibitions that they had initially imposed. Others, by contrast, such as the United States, Canada and even some of the countries which have applied for accession, have been slow to lift the restrictions, which they still maintain, wrongly, even today. We shall continue to work on this question, taking as our basis the WTO Agreement on Health and Plant Health.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking more generally, it should be emphasised, first of all, that this crisis has had major repercussions on the Community budget. We decided to grant an overall budget of EUR 400 million to the four Member States affected this year, and the latest forecasts show that the Union’s anticipated financial contribution will be slightly more than EUR 1.5 billion. We shall take the necessary measures from the point of view of budgetary procedure. There is no doubt that this is an exceptional situation. We do not know how to predict the budget for epizootics on this scale, and we shall therefore have to make adjustments as we go along. That is just one aspect of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A second aspect, of course, is the damage done to the image of our livestock farming industry, following the slaughter of almost four million animals. A third aspect is the fact that the problem, as has already been mentioned, is also present outside the European Union, and we are seriously worried following the recent appearance of a case in Turkish Thrace.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we at the Commission hope that we shall be able to learn some lessons for future use, with regard to the handling of this sort of crisis, so that we can improve our current regulatory and legislative system, for example by making provision for a certain number of additional requirements for intra-Community trade in small ruminants, such as restricting the number of stopping points, which would probably be the first step. We are also working on a proposal regarding the identification and registration of sheep and goats, and on another proposal regarding the importing of animal products by travellers. We are also working towards adjusting our inspection procedures when this type of epizootic appears. I believe that we now have sufficient experience, but we must not delude ourselves. The reinforcement of our legislation and of our systems, however necessary it may be, will not, on its own, be enough to prevent the reappearance of such an epidemic. We must also improve the operation of the veterinary services within Member States, and there is not doubt that we must also change our farming practices.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is one that several Members have drawn attention to during our discussions, and that is the question of vaccination. As far as the use of so-called ‘ring’ vaccination around infected holdings is concerned, I should like to remind those of you who have sought to implicate the Commission by asking why the Commission did not order compulsory vaccination as a matter of urgency, that in our present legal system, which whatever any one says is characterised by certain forms of subsidiarity, vaccination is the responsibility of the national authorities. There is therefore a procedure which allows any Member State that wants to to use vaccination, and that is how it is done. The system exists and it is at the disposal of the Member States, but it is not the Commission’s responsibility. I believe that I have thus given a clear answer to the questions raised by Mr van Dam, Mr Martinez, Mr Mulder and Mrs Lucas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
