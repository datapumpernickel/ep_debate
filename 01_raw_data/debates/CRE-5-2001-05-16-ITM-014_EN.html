<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buitenweg (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, during the formal meeting with President Schuster of the Republic of Slovakia, we spoke yet again of the historical opportunity of overcoming once and for all the division of Europe. An opportunity that must be given concrete shape, as the honourable Member Böge said. In just three years’ time we shall be able to work together on an equal footing with colleagues from current candidate countries, at any rate in theory. Consequently we must speed up institutional changes to ensure that enlargement goes smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall shortly be receiving the three-year plan on administrative preparation. Perhaps then, we may come to the conclusion that it would be sensible to employ civil servants from candidate countries in advance so that they can play a part in preparing for enlargement. Think, for example, of people required to set up a language regime. It therefore strikes me as extreme foolish to reject that option now in the resolution of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement must be prepared for not only administratively, but also substantively. In order to exchange mutual experiences it is important that contacts between ourselves and colleagues from candidate countries are intensified. The Committee on Budgets asks that the most appropriate form for this be included in the three-year plan. I myself can imagine that it might, for instance, be useful if a very limited number of facilities were offered to these parliamentarians and future Member States so that their visits are as effective and useful as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, enlargement will increase pressure on the margin of the budget. It is therefore a financially sound policy to pay off real estate costs faster, creating scope for future budgets. In addition accelerated financing leads to considerable savings in interest. It is, though, a pity that I now have the doubtful honour of being the rapporteur who is investing a very considerable sum in the parliament building here in Strasbourg. But you will agree with me that for as long as the Parliament is condemned to being a travelling circus, it is not sensible to force another EUR 210 million down the throat of the European taxpayer. It is becoming less and less of one, so that it is all that money for just four days in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me nicely to another point in which I hope content will win out over the fine words, and that is the environmental audit. Mr President, this House also devoted some fine words a few years ago to the desirability of an environmental audit. An interinstitutional working party was even set up. But since it was not given the slightest priority, it was short-lived. So we shall now again, and more resolutely, take responsibility and consequently, Parliament should make a clear political promise to participate in EMAS, the Community eco-management and audit system.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political position against discrimination must be converted here in this House into policy. Equality of opportunity is still not a reality. And I am talking not only about women in influential positions but, for example, about equal treatment irrespective of sexual orientation, race or religion. The Committee on Budgets therefore asks the Secretary-General for clarification on what measures are necessary to be able to keep the promise of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in recent years we have gained greater understanding of the advantages of Activity Based Budgeting and Activity Based Management. The old management structures method of budgeting need a radical overhaul and part of that is a clear division of responsibilities between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets in the area of personnel policy as at present specified in the budgetary procedure. The Committee on Budgets examines the financial envelope and its limitations and the Bureau concerns itself with specific content. This system must be complemented by guiding statements by the House to the Bureau and close monitoring of the management of the Secretary-General. Should problems arise in future with the Bureau or the Administration, they should lead to changes at that level and not to the assumption of management responsibilities by a House of 626 political representatives. The new <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> must go hand in hand with a radical change in culture, so that the Administration can be democratic, monitored and also very decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">To those honourable Members who have been seriously concerned about the margin of category 5, I can say by way of reassurance that that this afternoon’s vote on the schedule of part-sessions for next year at any rate turned out very favourably financially. Estimates were based on a four-day week in Strasbourg and the decision now taken entails no change in costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, I should like to take this opportunity to pick out one or two points and examine them more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement: of course we must prepare for enlargement. But anyone who thinks that preparing for enlargement merely means creating new posts has failed to recognise the problem. Everything has to be tested against what we have learned to appreciate and love about the <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>of the European Parliament over the last twenty years. We face a huge challenge if we want to master all that. Nor is it a question of creating new posts and manning them with officials from applicant countries. Why are there no other options <span class="italic">in situ</span>? For example, the Commission intends to work with satellites in applicant countries in the translation area.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to create information offices because we have a problem as regards the acceptance of accession to the European Union. That is our job as representatives of the people. It is not a question of taking a few people to the fleshpots of Europe here in Strasbourg or in Brussels or Luxembourg, it is a question of bringing people to the European Union. That is best done locally. That is why I ask you to consider carefully what really needs to be done and what is better done through activities in the candidate countries, in order to save money. The Commission is on the right track here.</p>
<p class="contents">Buildings policy: I agree with the rapporteur that, as things stand, the cheapest solution here in Strasbourg is to pay off the outstanding amounts as quickly as possible. But that is only the second cheapest solution. We must be clear about that. The cheapest solution would be to build ourselves. Then we can decide on the layout and fittings, without having to admit in the end that someone has done well out of us and that now we must somehow take over. We went through that in Brussels and we have been through it here. We could show a bit more intelligence here. That would be the cheapest solution. What we are doing is the second cheapest and I should like to make that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Staff policy: I am surprised at the administration, which is calling for numerous new posts on the one hand, while at the same time making increasing concessions in the so-called non-occupancy quota. This means that more posts are saved than new posts requested. We still need an in-depth discussion of how this can be reconciled. In other words, there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre by transferring staff between the services of the European Parliament without always needing to create new posts straight away. I can tell you now that the PPE group will be looking at this issue very closely in the autumn, once we have the actual figures to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the rapporteur has also taken up our transport options. I hope that we shall not have to cycle around Brussels. I consider that far too dangerous. I think the initiative by the town of Strasbourg following the change in the mayor's office is real progress. We too can take the tram now. Perhaps we can take the metro in Brussels. That would take us one stage further. But, as I say, bicycles in general are too dangerous in my book. I hope that we can find a reasonable solution here.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the PPE shall carry out a strict and close examination of the budget line by line in the autumn, once the figures are available. But let me make one thing clear: if the report is adopted tomorrow, this does not mean free passage for the reading which we shall have to hold in September or October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work; I support most of what she has said, especially on reform.</p>
<p class="contents">You may be aware of the findings of a recent Euro poll, which showed that the European Parliament is one of the most recognised of all EU institutions. Therefore, the onus is really on us to ensure that we increase the confidence of European citizens in the EU as a whole. This is why we need to set an example and lead the way in improving effectiveness, transparency and accountability, as outlined by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the reform process embarked upon so far sometimes feels a bit slow. We need to speed things up in the coming year and try to embrace reform and modernise our working methods and decision-making processes. As everyone agrees, this is essential because of the challenges presented by enlargement. There is a clear danger that the EU could be deflected from its course if the public does not see concrete and swift reform being carried out on a significant scale.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us know that enlargement will have far-reaching effects on all aspects of Parliament's services. The additional budgetary cost of enlargement could be in the region of EUR 145m per year, according to one report. We could need about 459 new offices in Brussels alone. This will need considerable planning, with all the implications well thought through. Therefore, Parliament's three-year plan is essential to make enlargement successful. It is critical that this plan should be considered and not rushed. I strongly oppose the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group imposing a deadline before the summer for this report, because if we do not have a considered and well thought-out enlargement plan, it could backfire on us. The PPE-DE Group has tabled other amendments, which are equally nonsensical and will not enhance the standing of the European Parliament if adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find particularly astonishing is that, on the one hand, we are constantly nit-picking about minor new establishment posts for the executive and yet, in practice, we are happy to increase posts for the political parties, when it suits particular needs, without any real justification.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are the principles of budgetary rigour and efficiency which the PPE-DE Group often talks about? It is important that we review these issues, but not at this stage. I wish to stress that the three-year plan should be considered because we face many challenges, but we should – and must – be more dynamic in all areas, in particular languages and buildings, because that is where the substantial costs lie. I hope the plan will in some ways think the unthinkable and radically review the language services, given that in two to three years' time we may have six new official languages to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">Just to give you some food for thought: the Commission is a very different institution from us, but it manages to work in two languages. Let me make it clear that I strongly believe in linguistic diversity, but we cannot just add on all these additional languages and still try to be an efficient and effective organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to buildings policy, we must carefully examine all available options. I know there is a proposal to purchase this building, and although it makes financial sense here and now in terms of the savings we will make in the immediate future, I am concerned about the long-term suitability of the building: it hardly meets our requirements now, so what is it going to be like six years down the line? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Buitenweg has drawn up an excellent report as a basis for Parliament’s budget next year. My sincerest thanks go to her accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the main challenges for the European Parliament are improved administration and increased efficiency. The EU’s forthcoming enlargement will make these especially necessary. Next year, we must prepare for the fact that in 2004 Parliament will grow by more than a hundred members bringing with them a dozen or so new languages. This will make very special demands on the organisation and enhanced effectiveness of the translation and interpreting services. There will also be totally new demands on general administration, which is why it is absolutely necessary to extend Activity Based Budgeting and Activity-Based Management to parliamentary administration also.</p>
