<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union is delighted to appear before Parliament to give details of the current state of preparations for the International Conference on Financing for Development, which is due to take place in Monterrey (Mexico), from 18 to 22 March.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, the Monterrey Conference has come to occupy a prominent place on the so-called Development Agenda, particularly after the attacks of 11 September and with the realisation that the problems of development in a globalised world require our full, immediate and urgent attention.</p>
<p class="contents">This widespread interest justifies the efforts made by everyone who attended the fourth meeting of the Conference’s Preparatory Committee, which has just been held in New York, and which concluded with the adoption of a text that will be submitted for the approval of the Heads of State and Government that are due to attend the Monterrey Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no accident that this document, which I shall discuss briefly a little later, is entitled “The Monterrey Consensus”. Given that the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey is undoubtedly one of the most important events in the field of cooperation during our Presidency, Spain wishes to attach special priority to this event and this priority is reflected in the level of the official representation. By this I mean that the Community delegation to the Monterrey Summit will be led by the President of the Spanish Government, the President-in-Office of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparations for the Conference, Mr President, have been extraordinarily complex, given their exhaustive nature and the huge number of individuals that have been involved in the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to thank the previous Presidencies of the Union for the considerable effort they have made throughout this process, since it has been a gradual process to bring us up to the point we have now reached. This ongoing and joint effort now means that, in Monterrey, the European Union can play the leading role it deserves as the world’s major donor of official development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I highlight and discuss the features of the text adopted in New York, I should like, Mr President, to put the Monterrey Conference in the proper context, because it is not an isolated process. Instead, it is part of what was started by the Millennium Declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000, on sustainable development and the fight against world poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, facing three independent but closely related procedures. Firstly, trade, within the framework of the commitments adopted at the conference of the World Trade Organisation held in Doha. Secondly, everything that concerns the mobilisation of financial resources, the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development and, thirdly, in the field of the environment, the Conference on sustainable development that is planned to take place in Johannesburg in September of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now refer briefly to the features of the Monterrey document, the famous Monterrey consensus that I mentioned earlier. This final text, adopted <span class="italic">ad referendum</span>, since a formal closing session could not be held in New York, consists of 73 numbered sections and reflects the spirit of consensus in which it was drawn up. Because it does not contain any unresolved elements, since everything has been agreed on, we hope that the Heads of State and Government will be able to maintain a genuine, frank and open political dialogue on the main issues that affect development and its current challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that has been concluded lays down that the fundamental pillars of international development cooperation are a series of principles shared by donors and beneficiaries and, in particular, the concept of good governance at all levels, the existence of solid democratic institutions and respect for the Rule of Law, all in the spirit of partnership, on the basis of which the developed States are committed to adopting a series of measures to make financing flows more flexible for developing countries – albeit with a set of conditions – enabling governments to use international cooperation to create domestic conditions favourable to economic growth and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">Developed countries also assume the obligation of promoting trade within the terms of the agreements adopted in the World Trade Organisation, which are generally considered to be the main driving force behind all economic activity. The developed States, after overseeing a reduction of official development aid in recent years, are now committed to increasing it.</p>
<p class="contents">This increase of resources is a commitment that applies to all donors, including the United States and Japan. The text adopted is in line with the Laeken Declaration and the entire document emphasises the private sector’s role as a driving force for development and as a source of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The text also takes up the need to increase resources to strengthen the institutional capacity of developing countries, and to implement the entire Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the international financial architecture, the autonomy of the existing institutions and the mandate of their boards of management will be upheld and support will be given to the process currently under way in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the same time, we will be insisting on the principles of coordination, of transparency and of the participation of the developing countries in the international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The mechanisms for following up the Conference were also the subject of intense debate, with the decision finally going to various methods of follow-up, at the spring meeting of the Economic and Social Council, with the Bretton Woods Institutions and with the participation of the World Trade Organisation, also including representatives of civil society and the private sector, and with high-level dialogue in the United Nations General Assembly, held every two years. At the same time, within the United Nations, the Secretariat-General has been asked to support the full use of existing mechanisms for coordinating the specialist agencies of the United Nations and the drawing up of an annual report on the work achieved in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">To this we can add a follow-up International Conference, whose concrete procedures will be defined by 2005. This set of instruments and these mechanisms are intended to ensure that the Monterrey Conference process remains on the agenda of the main international organisations and institutions, as well as in the fora of the United Nations, and of its specialised programmes and agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not wish to end, Mr President, without mentioning some of the contributions made by the European Union, that arise in the text on more than one occasion. The European Parliament must be very aware, and we must be proud, of the firm position that the European Union has maintained throughout this Monterrey process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to list these contributions. Firstly, the concept of partnership and the insistence on the need for solid economic policies, good governance and democratic principles, and the defence of human rights. At the same time, the European Union has insisted on the participation of civil society in the development process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to highlight the European Union’s position of emphasising the need for development to be sustainable and to incorporate economic, social and environmental aspects, whilst respecting, in all cases, gender equality and holding the fight against poverty to be a fundamental objective. The Presidency, therefore, regrets that it was not possible to include a specific reference to the innovative concept of public goods on a global scale, in the face of opposition, to the very last, both from the Group of 77 and from other donors, although it hopes that, given its importance, the discussions on its definition and financing will continue in the appropriate fora.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union has sought to highlight the link between the effectiveness and efficiency of official development aid and the implementation, by the beneficiaries of aid, of appropriate policies in the political, economic and social fields. These are policies focused on giving aid to those in greatest need, so that maximum benefit can be gained from this official development aid. In this way, the emphasis is focused not only on increasing the volume of resources, but on its effective use, with the fight against corruption also playing a key role and, furthermore, the commitment to continue with negotiations on the specific United Nations convention applying to this issue. Similarly, external debt relief has been linked to the effective use of these resources to achieve economic growth and a sustained development that benefits the least-favoured sectors of each country taking part in these mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the European Union has worked very actively with other major donors, such as the United States and Japan, and with the Group of 77, to achieve consensus on the objective of contributing 0.7% of GDP to development, which allows us to include the differing points of view, economic realities and sensitivities.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise that, precisely because of this work, a similar terminology has been used in the Monterrey consensus to that approved at the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the European Union has made efforts, which have been crowned with success, to have explicit references included in the text on multilateral cooperation in light of the new transnational challenges and threats arising from the funding of terrorism and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that the European Union has also worked actively to have specific references included in this text to private-sector banking and to the importance of the development of this sector in supporting small and medium-sized businesses in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the support measures to increase the institutional capacity of the developing countries in the field of trade should also be highlighted. For this reason, the Presidency sets great store by the package of practical measures that is being prepared by the competent services of the Commission, to increase developing countries’ negotiating power in the field of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, following the fourth and last preparatory meeting, the Presidency is quite optimistic about the forthcoming Monterrey Conference. Despite the doubts that remained up until the last moment, we were able to adopt a final text on 27 January, almost two months before this important international meeting. The fact that this was achieved by consensus – as I have already mentioned – and that we managed to involve all the donors in this consensus, makes the Monterrey consensus a good platform for the future, because it is creating the climate of trust that this complex process requires and which, furthermore, now means that the round tables planned for Monterrey can take place in an atmosphere that is positive and constructive and not one of confrontation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Monterrey Conference needs to be an innovative event, by tackling development and the fight against poverty from an all-encompassing position, covering the various aspects and encouraging the participation of all players. This global vision gives the process as a whole an extraordinary complexity, which we must also tackle pragmatically and realistically, by means of work that makes inclusion – and not exclusion – the main objective of all those who are committed to cooperation development tasks. We hope that the international campaign that is announced in Article 62 of the document, as one of the Millennium objectives, will also contribute to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I can ensure this Parliament that the Council Presidency remains firmly committed to this approach and that the success of the Conference is still our main objective, especially if we take account of the fact that development cooperation policy must be one of the pillars on which the European Union’s external action is based, and must be in perfect harmony with other pillars such as the external and common security policies and trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we are sure that the Monterrey Conference offers us an historic opportunity for the European Union to be able to project and transmit, together with the rest of the participants in that event, a clear message in defence of the values we hold dear. Therefore, we consider that the defence of the democracy, of good governance, of strengthening the institutional development of aid-receiving countries, the Rule of Law, peace and security, and human rights, are crucial elements of economic and social development as a whole.</p>

We are convinced that in the current international context, we cannot approach the Financing for Development Conference on a business-as-usual basis: this time we need concrete action.</p>
<p class="contents">The present crisis will impact on economic development worldwide and it will be once again the poorest who pay the highest price. We must counter this tendency by trying our best to make globalisation work for the poor and not against the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Financing for Development Conference represents a key opportunity for the international community to enter into a new "global deal" on the assumption that a safer world for all will only be possible if there is a strong signal on the renewed commitment in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">After the agreement reached in the Preparatory Committee on the final document for the Conference, we should focus our attention on positive initiatives that the EU could make in key areas and on the input we can make in the political declaration in Monterrey.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is needed on the volume of ODA: we have to agree on concrete steps to double ODA flows within the next five years, in order to be able to achieve the Millennium development goals. ODA must also be more efficient: we have to complete work on the untying of aid in time for the Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">All the themes discussed internationally will remain on the international agenda, whether or not they are specifically included in the Monterrey consensus. One such case is the discussion on global public goods. We will continue arguing in order to give some real impetus to international solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, Monterrey and Johannesburg are closely linked, as both look at ways and means to implement the Millennium Declaration and the International Development targets, which we strongly support. Also they are both related to the trade negotiations following the launch of these in Doha. We have an opportunity to work in a comprehensive manner and we look forward to taking part in the conference and making it a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, more than three billion people are trying to survive on less than two dollars per day. Eradicating poverty is a moral imperative, but it is also an issue directly linked to our common security. We live in a world in which countries and people are increasingly interdependent, which is more divided and in which there is greater danger of tensions, large-scale migration, damage to the natural environment and increased crime. All this can of course also be linked to desperate acts that can lead, for example to terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that we must view not only the forthcoming conference in Monterrey, but also this autumn’s world summit in Johannesburg. On both occasions, rich and poor countries will have an opportunity to agree upon a long-term plan to eradicate poverty step by step. The rich nations must offer increased support. The poor nations must determine their priorities when it comes to work on combating poverty, greater respect for democracy and human rights and a more vigorous fight against corruption etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the consensus document referred to here today is weak. No amount of fine words and eloquent rhetoric can eradicate poverty. The spirit of this resolution is therefore that the EU should make every conceivable effort in Monterrey to ensure that specific pledges are made on increased cooperation and transfers of resources, debt cancellation and generally increased aid in a range of areas. One particular issue is that of work designed to increase the production of the global, or ‘public’, goods to which Commissioner Nielson refers, that is to say efforts to protect the climate, combat deforestation and develop vaccines and medicines to combat infectious diseases etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this resolution, we are sending a clear signal to the Commission, to the governments of our Member States and to the international community that, as parliamentarians, we take these issues extremely seriously and desire more than merely words in Monterrey. We want to see practical results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the fine speeches, international conferences and development programmes, the gap between rich and poor has only widened over the past decades. 1.2 billion people, that is one fifth of the world population, live on less than one dollar a day. The three richest people together own more than the total income of the world’s 48 poorest countries, and 130 million children never attend school. These are the bare facts.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have a clear lesson to learn from the disastrous attacks of 11 September. In the Global Village, we have to be prepared to tackle these problems together, but our response falls extremely far short of the mark. I want to warn against a new international doctrine according to which the western world, having turned its back on these one billion people fighting for their daily existence, withdraws behind barriers made up of weapon shields and expensive technological defence materiel.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of USD 379 billion which, if it were up to President Bush, is being earmarked for the Pentagon next year is more than seven times the total amount of development aid spent last year worldwide. This situation is all the more poignant when one realises that, despite the worldwide agreement to spend 0.7% of GNP on development aid, the figure has even dropped to an all time low of 0.24%. This is unacceptable because it is precisely a doubling of the worldwide development aid figures that is required in order to meet our international pledge, namely that, by 2015, all children in the world will be able to attend school and receive medical care.</p>
<p class="contents">The pledges for 2015 are clear. The Member States must now very quickly meet this 0.7% target in a practical way. We must not allow the breakthrough at Doha to be watered down. European agricultural policy must change to benefit the Third World. Without any serious commitments by the Western countries, the conference in Monterrey will end up in a stalemate. This is why Europe, as the world’s largest donor of development cooperation and as the largest international trading power, must be prepared to throw its weight into the balance, building on the successes achieved at Doha, with a view to reaching authentic binding agreements in Monterrey about aid, education, health care and far-reaching debt relief. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More development aid is not enough but, without extra funding, poverty cannot be eradicated. Affordable schooling and health care must enable people to develop the economy themselves and attract foreign capital. In order to achieve the UN development objectives, aid has to be doubled. Most donors still give far less than the agreed 0.7% of their GNP. America could easily contribute far more, but only has an eye for increasing its military expenditure. Many European partners too are still failing to meet the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems involved in granting aid should not be an excuse for doing too little. Learning from experience and improved international coordination can make development cooperation more effective. Aid must help set up good governance, democratic structures and a well-functioning market economy. Access to the global market is essential for developing countries. Insupportable debts must be substantially lowered, and the Debt Repayment Fund must be adequate for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty, Mr President, is the breeding ground for violence and terrorism. More aid is not only a humanitarian necessity, but also an absolute condition for attaining stability and peace in the world.</p>

<p class="contents">For more than 20 years, the UN has told donor countries that they must dedicate 0.7% of their GNP to state development aid, in accordance with OECD standards, but only four countries are respecting this commitment. Aid is decreasing in general and the current average is 0.2%. Developing countries are suffering badly from the gradual and structural deterioration in trade terms for basic products and are caught up in the vicious cycle of paying back often illegitimate debts, as well as the interest charged on them. How can we raise financial resources for the human, economic and social development of these people, given these circumstances?</p>
<p class="contents">Our hopes rest on Monterrey therefore, unless the outcome has already been determined and the American positions dominate this conference, as was the case at Doha. By faithfully following the liberal principles of development that the international institutions and the European Commission have been applying for 20 years, the document before us, just as the Monterrey consensus, never calls neo-liberal globalisation into question. However, the income of the population of developing countries has continued to fall over the same period, which proves this formula is ineffective and counter-productive. It is failing, but we carry on regardless.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if the draft consensus for Monterrey, which does not propose any ambitious objectives, any practical financial measures or a timetable, is set in stone. If that is the case, and if the conference limits itself to making wonderful statements which will never be followed up, I think that we must cancel it and the millions of euro that have been earmarked to organise the conference must be given directly to the least-advanced countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a shame because there are grounds to condemn and criticise, but there are also grounds to discuss and, in relation to mobilising aid, propose cancelling debt, taxing capital and reforming the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must seize this opportunity to push through the adoption of ambitious objectives as well as restrictive measures, which could enable poverty levels to be cut in half by 2015. The EU must reiterate the commitment made at Gothenburg to request the Member States to increase their aid to 0.7%. The governments and parliaments which agreed to the principle of a Tobin-type tax must demonstrate their interest in regulating the financial markets and redistributing wealth towards the south.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, all those taking part in the summit must ensure that it is a success. The European Union has a responsibility to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, and despite several declarations of good intentions, the formal 1974 commitment to attain the objective of public aid for development at a level of 0.7% of GDP and despite the fact that the World Bank recently found it necessary to double the resources earmarked for public aid, the truth is that it is no higher than 0.22% in the OECD countries, the lowest level ever, having fallen by around 25% in the last decade and not currently exceeding 0.32% in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop and with Johannesburg on the horizon, the Monterrey Conference is taking on an undeniable importance. It is truly time to reverse past actions and negative trends, to look at the problem of the development of poor countries in a different way, a way that demonstrates greater solidarity and to adopt practical and binding measures. We respect the Council decision of 8 November, but it is crucial that the Spanish Presidency and the Commission spare no effort to ensure that Monterrey results in objective and scheduled commitments that guarantee some progress, even with the awareness of the retrograde and unacceptable positions of the American administration in this field, which cannot impose conformist positions on others, and even with the awareness of the weaknesses of the so-called Monterrey consensus itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Monterrey must also result in guidelines that put an end to the devastating effect of foreign debt on the development of developing countries, by putting forward mechanisms that do not hold back the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative and which are primarily founded on global recognition of the principle of debt relief. The appalling situation in which the developing countries find themselves cannot remain as it is and the European Union and its Member States must not only not content themselves with being the largest donor but must also adopt a clear position which helps these countries to find a way out of this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Traditional development aid, which is taken more or less to be a sort of gift day in which the rich countries give to the poor ones, does not work. What we need is an all-embracing concept of the peaceful development of the poor countries. This is, of course, easier said than done, but we must remember that it is the countries with a wealth of raw materials, such as Angola or Nigeria, for example, whose people are the poorest. That is not by chance; there is a system behind it. We need to ask ourselves which, in this instance, are the donor countries and which the recipients – a question which, for me, has not been answered unambiguously.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the developing countries is worse than in the days of colonial rule. The key is fair world trade, in which raw materials have to be at the prices they deserve, and in which the net product must remain in these countries in order to develop their infrastructure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
